This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Especially for an artist who, just years before, sold out Madison Square Garden for three consecutive nights. CHAD \u201cCHADWICK\u201d STOKES is anything but a typical rock star. So, there he was, wading across a river to escape the chasing railroad bulls and hanging in the different down and out jungles with other traveling folks. And in the end, after the three had finally reached the West Coast and were laying face down in the dirt at gunpoint care of the NSA, he says it was all well worth it. \u201cI had ridden the trains a little bit in the past for a day or two but I had never done it for weeks at a time,\u201d Stokes says. \u201cI discovered an America that I knew was out there but had limited experience with. There's all kinds of people out on the rails: people simply trying to get from point A to B, people running from whatever they left behind, people with nowhere else to go. You get to see a part of America that only the trains go through -- remote stretches without any sign of mankind.\" It was out on these long isolated stretches and in the inner city train yards that Stokes found the inspiration for his solo debut, titled SIMMERKANE II. While riding the rails, Stokes made a designated stop so his band, State Radio, could play an anti-war concert at the Denver Coliseum with Rage Against The Machine. It is a DIY social consciousness that Stokes came to early in life - growing up as a pacifist, working in Zimbabwe after high school and eventually co-founding the Elias Fund, the Dispatch Foundation, and now Calling All Crows. In 2008, Stokes was honored as Humanitarian of the Year at the Boston Music Awards. Simmerkane II, a proper follow-up to the State Radio EP (Simmerkane I), is a marked evolution in the musician-songwriter\u2019s creative journey. Produced by John Dragonetti (of The Submarines), the album features background vocals from Carly Simon, Matt Embree (Rx Bandits), The White Buffalo, Blake Hazard (The Submarines), and Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars. The sound is an engaging mix of Americana, country, folk and rock in the service of some undeniably evocative lyrics. The songs tell a loose narrative of travel, love and loss, like some re-imagined rock-n-roll odyssey. The journey begins with \u201cAdelaide,\u201d a fuzzed-out melodic folk rocker containing the prophetic line, \u201cWe left Worcester with our boots and our bags - and America undressed herself in front of our eyes.\u201d Next, listeners venture into the \u201cCrowbar Hotel\u201d to discover an underground world populated by hard luck outsiders: \u201cWe are sold to the highest bidder, we are down to our very last crumb - May we invite ourselves to dinner, \u2018cause we might just have to make a run.\u201d The song \u201cBack To The Races,\u201d has Stokes reflecting on past mistakes and longing for the childhood farm while still seduced by the excitement of the journey and a new love. The symphonic rock-n-roll charges ahead before dropping down for the intimate lyrical refrain \u201cBack to the races - and on with the day.\u201d The two-disc deluxe package includes three bonus tracks with Sierra Leone\u2019s Refugee All Stars, a musical ensemble of refugees from Sierra Leone\u2019s 1991 civil war. Stokes, who did humanitarian work in Zimbabwe as a youth, has been a longtime fan of the All Stars. The tracks include a lilting African-tinged folk song called \u201cCoffee And Wine,\u201d a reflective reggae track titled, \u201cAll My Possessions (Ode To Troy)\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Have You\u201d \u2013 a heartfelt ballad that eventually erupts in celebration with the All Stars\u2019 backing vocals and percussions carrying the weight of their troubled history and eventual transcendence. \u201cIt was such an honor to work with the All Stars,\u201d Stokes explains. \u201cThe songs we did were kind of folk songs and one reggae song, so they were a bit out of their element trying to adapt to the folky farm kid and his songs. But you can hear their history in their singing and playing and it adds this amazing power to the songs.\u201d Simmerkane II is an ambitious album about discovery, loss and moving on. What begun as a journey across an unseen America becomes a moving musical tribute to the resilience of the human heart. \u201cThe album was initially inspired by the freight train trip with my brother and that vast underworld that exists out there,\u201d Stokes explains. \u201cBut then it\u2019s also about growing up on the farm and losing loved ones; a young man learning about life.\u201d In his spare time, Stokes can still be found hopping trains with his beloved travel companion, Lefty.

What has changed, along with some new gray hair, is a depth the band could never have had when playing the Bay Area club circuit and opening for artists including Chris Isaak, Mudhoney and The Tragically Hip.\n\nThreading the 13 tracks on \u201cGnashville\u201d is the vantage point of a life more than half lived -- a depth of conscience that touches on social discord (\u201cBurning Bridges\u201d), smartphone addiction (\u201cDisease\u201d), the West Coast housing crisis (\u201cYou Got Yours\u201d) and the school shooting in Parkland, Florida (\u201cMolly\u201d).\n\n\u201cChildlike wonder lost in thunder, Molly\u2019s on the run/Synapse missing no one\u2019s listening, here we go again,\u201d sings guitarist/lead singer Steve Hartsoe in \u201cMolly,\u201d which closes the album.\n\n\u201cI laugh more around these guys than I do in any other environment,\u201d Steve Hartsoe says. \u201cBut I think we share a similar view about things going on around us and in the world, and so much of it is not very pleasant. That comes out in the songs.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say London Down is, well, all downer. In \u201cEvery Gig,\u201d the band turns a Motown beat into a garage-band rager about the unstable yet raucous joy of life in an indie band -- most of it straight out of the band\u2019s scrapbook.\n\n\u201cVan broke down in Salinas town one more Econoline for the heap/B.D.\u2019s working college radio from a boat somewhere at sea.\u201d Then comes the chorus that forces the listener to forget the verses about broken bathroom lights, drunk soundmen and crappy stages: \u201cPlug me in and count it off/Gonna do what we do till we die/ It\u2019s the indie life.\u201d\nLuke Bryan pedal steel/guitarist Dave Ristrim, a childhood friend of Benjamin and Carbone, produced the album. He also added pedal steel, 12-string electric guitar and baritone guitar on \u201cGnashville.\u201d Fellow Luke Bryan bandmate, bassist James \u201cCap\u2019n\u201d Cook, recorded, mixed and mastered the album at his home studio, Studio on the Ridge in Nashville. Cook also handles harmony duties on the album.\n\n\u201cWe had not seen each other in more than 20 years, but sharing song ideas and making this album feels like we never stopped,\u201d says Carbone. \u201cThe chemistry is still there, and the new songs sound better than we could have imagined.

After the turn of the milennium, hungry for challenge, she began performing.\n\n\n\nTHE CD\n\n\n\nThe culmination of that journey can be heard in \"Love of the Land,\" Christa's long-awaited debut as a solo artist.

Sus trabajos discogr\u00e1ficos manifiestan el amor de la agrupaci\u00f3n hacia su gente, su cultura y folklore.\n\n\n\nA pesar de su \u00e9xito actual, el humilde comienzo de los hermanos Plancarte sigue siendo, hoy por hoy, su mejor escuela y su mayor aliciente para continuar su lucha por consagrarse como los preferidos en el gusto de la gente, por esa raz\u00f3n su gira de conciertos semana a semana son un \u00e9xito.\n\nCabe mencionar que TIERRA CALI recientemente recibi\u00f3 un Disco de Oro por m\u00e1s de 50,000!!! copias vendidas, de su m\u00e1s reciente producci\u00f3n algo que sin duda en estos momentos es todo un logro debido a la situaci\u00f3n que la industria musical vive con la pirater\u00eda, pero gracias a la calidad de la m\u00fasica de TIERRA CALI, el p\u00fablico no duda en comprar los discos originales del grupo.\n\nA pesar de que la carrera de TIERRA CALI apenas inici\u00f3 en 1998, eso no ha sido impedimento para que el grupo sea ya todo un sin\u00f3nimo de \u00e9xito, pues cada uno de sus discos siempre han recibido por lo menos un disco de oro por sus altas ventas, por lo que en sus 12 a\u00f1os de trayectoria ya tienen m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de discos vendidos!! los cuales se certifican con los reconocimientos de oro y platino que TIERRA CALI ha recibido y que aqu\u00ed se enumeran.\n\n\"Alegr\u00eda Calentana\" (2007) - Disco Multiplatino por m\u00e1s de 200,000 copias vendidas.\n\n\"Grandes \u00c9xitos\" (2007) - Disco de Oro\n\n\"Enamorado de Ti\" (2007) - Disco de Oro por 50,000 copias y Disco de Platino certificado por la RIAA por ventas de m\u00e1s de 100,000 discos en Estados Unidos.\n\n\"M\u00e1s All\u00e1 de la Distancia\" (2008) - Disco de Oro\n\n\"Si T\u00fa Te Vas\" (2009) - Disco de Oro\n\n\n\n\"Maldito amor\" (2010) - Disco de Oro\n\n\n\nNo se puede dejar de mencionar que es tal el \u00e9xito que el grupo tiene en la Uni\u00f3n Americana, que mientras algunos grupos se quejan de que no tienen presentaciones, TIERRA CALI consigue abarrotar los lugares donde se presenta e incluso hay ocasiones que hacen hasta 2 shows por noche, esto avalado por el premio PROMUSA que TIERRA CALI recibi\u00f3 como \u201cMejor Grupo en su G\u00e9nero 2009\u201d por Los Promotores Unidos USA certific\u00e1ndolos como uno de los grupos m\u00e1s taquilleros del Momento, lo que los avala por los especialistas como un grupo verdaderamente exitoso.\n\nLas producciones de TIERRA CALI son:\n\nNo pares no\u2026\n\nEl Arroyito\n\nEl Pescador Nadador\n\nAlegr\u00eda Calentana\n\n12 Alegres y Calentanos \u00e9xitos\n\nEnamorado de Ti\n\nSi t\u00fa te Vas\n\nMaldito Amor\n\nUN SIGLO DE AMOR\n\n\n\nAdem\u00e1s de 5 DVD en vivo:\n\nEN VIVO DESDE EL CARNAVAL DE HOUSTON, TX\n\nEN VIVO DESDE LA MONUMENTAL DE MORELIA, MICH.\n\nEN VIVO DESDE LA TIERRA QUE LOS VIO NACER.\n\n\u00cdNTIMO\n\nEN VIVO DESDE VALLE DE BRAVO.\n\n\n\nActualmente se encuentran en la promoci\u00f3n de \"rom\u00e1nticos del momento\"de donde se desprenden sencillos como \"amor real\" y actualmente se encuentran en la promoci\u00f3n de su m\u00e1s reciente \u00e9xito llamado \"El \u00faltimo ni el primero\".", "otherInfo": "Tierra Cali Tour 2020 Puro Rancho Vali"}, {"Address": "224 Vintage Wy, Novato, CA 94945", "Artist": "the Hell Yeahs", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.55345, 38.088411], "Date": "Sat Jan 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "HopMonk Tavern Novato", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Danny Click & The Hell Yeahs (9th Anniversary Bash)"}, {"Address": "1317 San Pablo Ave, Berkeley, CA 94702", "Artist": "Tom Rigney", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.295337, 37.880135], "Date": "Sat Jan 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ashkenaz Music & Dance Community Center", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Dance Lesson with Mike Ferketich at 8:00 pm / Show at 9:00 pm\nHe may have been crowned Emperor of the 2011 Sacramento Jazz Jubilee, but violinist-fiddler-composer and singer Tom Rigney and his band Flambeau have always been royalty at Ashkenaz.

In a career that spans almost four decades, he's gone from drumming for blues icon Albert Collins to holding the lead guitar spot in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers to leading his own band and touring worldwide. Montoya is revered for his ability to move from subtly melodic guitar playing to slash-and-burn pyrotechnics. Equally forceful are his deep, soul-baring vocals. Years of constant touring, playing unforgettable shows at clubs, concert halls and festivals, have earned him his position at the top of the contemporary blues world. And it all started with a chance meeting in the mid-1970s with legendary bluesman Albert Collins, who offered Montoya a spot in his band, where he stayed for the next five years. Coco was initially hired as Collins' drummer and later\u2014with Albert mentoring him on the guitar\u2014became the band's rhythm guitarist. A few years after leaving Collins' band, British blues star John Mayall heard Coco jamming onstage and was so impressed that he hired him for the newly reformed Bluesbreakers.\n\nWhen Montoya launched his solo career in 1993, he already had an instantly recognizable burning-hot sound and style all his own. His debut album solidified his stature as the blues' newest rising star. Over the course of his nine previous solo albums, Montoya has consistently delivered piping hot blues, rock and soul. His new album (his fifth for Alligator), Coming In Hot, is another instant classic. Montoya's fiery, melodic guitar playing and passionate vocals fuel one memorable song after another. Guitar Player says Montoya plays \"stunning, powerhouse blues with a searing tone, emotional soloing, and energetic, unforced vocals.\"\n\nComing In Hot, produced by Tony Braunagel (Eric Burdon, Curtis Salgado, Taj Mahal, Bonnie Raitt), features 11 songs, ranging from the blistering, hard-rocking title track to the gritty and potent blues shuffle Water To Wine to the emotional ballad What Am I?. He delivers Albert Collins' Lights Are On But Nobody's Home with uncompromising, dynamic energy. Montoya's unpredictable guitar playing and smoking, soulful vocals are inspired by a backing band featuring renowned musicians including bassists Bob Glaub (Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Jerry Lee Lewis) and Mike Mennell (Jimmy Buffett, John Fogerty), keyboardist Mike Finnigan (Jimi Hendrix, Etta James, Taj Mahal), rhythm guitarists Billy Watts (Eric Burdon) and Johnny Lee Schell (Bonnie Raitt), and Braunagel on drums.\n\nHenry \"Coco\" Montoya was born in Santa Monica, California, on October 2, 1951, and raised in a working class family. Growing up, Coco immersed himself in his parents' record collection. He listened to big band jazz, salsa, doo-wop and rock 'n' roll. His first love was drums; he acquired a kit at age 11. He got a guitar two years later. \"I'm sure the Beatles had something to do with this,\" Montoya recalls. \"I wanted to make notes as well as beats.\" But guitar was his secondary instrument. Montoya turned his love of drumming into his profession, playing in a number of area rock bands while still in his teens and eventually becoming an in-demand drummer.\n\nIn 1969, Montoya saw Albert King opening up a Creedence Clearwater Revival/Iron Butterfly concert at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. He was transformed. \"After Albert got done playing,\" says Montoya, \"my life was changed. When he played, the music went right into my soul. It grabbed me so emotionally that I had tears welling up in my eyes. Nothing had ever affected me to this level. He showed me what music and playing the blues were all about. I knew that was what I wanted to do.\"\n\nThen fate took over. In the early 1970s, Albert Collins was booked to play a matinee at the same small club in Culver City, California, where Montoya had played the night before. The club owner gave Collins permission to use Montoya's drums. Montoya continues the story: \"I show up to pick up my equipment and I see that someone had been playing my drums and I got a little angry with the club owner. So Albert called me up at the club and was real nice and apologetic. I went down to see his show and it just tore my head off. The thing that I had seen and felt with Albert King came pouring back on me when I saw Albert Collins.\"\n\nA few months later, Collins desperately needed a drummer for a tour of the Northwest and he called Coco. During the tour, Albert took Montoya under his wing, teaching him about blues music and life on the road. After the tour ended, Montoya remained in the band for five more years. It was during this time that Coco began doubling on guitar. And Albert went out of his way to teach him. \"We'd sit in hotel rooms for hours and play guitar,\" remembers Montoya. \"He'd play that beautiful rhythm of his and just have me play along. He was always saying, 'Don't think about it, just feel it.' He was like a father to me,\" says Coco, who often crashed at Collins' home. When he declared Montoya his \"son,\" it was the highest praise and affection he could offer. In return, Montoya learned everything he could from the legendary Master of the Telecaster.\n\nIn 1984, John Mayall needed a guitarist for the newly reformed Bluesbreakers. Hearing Coco at a jam session, he was blown away, and offered Coco this prestigious spot in his legendary band. Filling the shoes of previous Bluesbreaker guitarists Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Mick Taylor would not be easy, but Montoya knew he could not pass up the opportunity to play with another blues legend. For the next ten years he toured the world and recorded with Mayall, soaking up the experience of life on the road and in the recording studio. Along with fellow Bluesbreaker guitarist Walter Trout, Montoya was a featured member of the band, and often opened shows with his own blistering blues.\n\nBy the early 1990s, Montoya struck out on his own. His debut as a leader, 1995's Gotta Mind To Travel (originally on Silvertone Records in England and later issued in the USA on Blind Pig Records), became an instant fan favorite. Blues fans, radio programmers and critics sent praise from all corners. The album immediately made it clear that Montoya was a guitarist and vocalist who ranked among the best players on the contemporary blues scene. In 1996, he won the Blues Music Award for Best New Blues Artist. Two more Blind Pig albums followed, and Coco was well on his way to the top of the blues-rock world.\n\nIn 2000, Coco's Alligator debut, Suspicion, quickly became the best-selling album of his career, earning regular radio airplay on over 120 stations nationwide. Montoya's fan base exploded. After two more highly successful and massively popular Alligator releases\u20142002's Can't Look Back and 2007's Dirty Deal\u2014Montoya signed with Ruf Records, cutting both a live and a studio album. Returning to Alligator with 2017's Hard Truth, Montoya delivered another fan and critical favorite. \"Montoya unleashes one career-topping performance after another.\" declared Blues Matters, \"the music immediately ranking among the best he's ever recorded.\"\n\nNow, with Coming In Hot, Coco Montoya again turns the burners to high and cooks from start to finish. Still an indefatigable road warrior, Montoya continues to tour virtually nonstop, bringing audiences to their feet from New York to New Orleans to Chicago to San Francisco. Across the globe, he's performed in countries including Australia, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, England, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Ecuador, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Czech Republic and Canada. According to Living Blues, \"Montoya is a show-stopper...heartfelt singing and merciless guitar with a wicked icy burn...he swings like a jazz man and stings like the Iceman, Albert Collins. He is one of the truly gifted blues artists of his generation.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "201 Washington St, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "X Method", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.643119, 38.23494], "Date": "Sat Jan 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Phoenix Theater", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "X-Method | Blessed Curse | Ape Shit Shenanigans | Sick Of Living | A Bloody Chasm"}, {"Address": "777 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Kat Robichaud", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9787380.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Sat Jan 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-11", "Genre": "Genres: Theatrical rock and roll", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel", "moreBioInfo": "katrobichaud.com\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/katrowbeeshow ...\n\nSpotify: https://goo.gl/CYpTp6\niTunes: https://goo.gl/nezTkM\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/LcBC2S\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/FbKfp7\nPatreon: https://goo.gl/bx693T\n\nLink to Kat's videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/KatRobichaud", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "5420 Nave Dr, Novato, CA 94949", "Artist": "Joey Avery", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9508261.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.530095, 38.051472], "Date": "Sat Jan 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-11", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Novato Theater Company", "moreBioInfo": "After starting his career in Cape Town, South Africa Joey Avery brought his positive and energetic brand of comedy to San Francisco and received the Jimmy Gunn award for Best Newcomer to the Bay Area comedy scene.

It is a dark, pressing and lively album that reflects on a sense of loss, of time slipping away through your fingers. MTT mixes up influences from Kate Bush, Michael Jackson, The Knife and Portishead and draws inspiration from horror movies, ghost stories blending the otherworldly with universal feelings of anxiety, melancholy and hope. [DUTCH] Na een veelgeprezen debuut komt MTT (voorheen Minus The Tiger) in het voorjaar van 2014 met de opvolger, Years From Now. Het sfeervolle, persoonlijke album is zowel muzikaal als inhoudelijk een spannende stap vooruit. Een intensieve periode waarin onder meer de geboorte van een dochter voor een nieuw perspectief zorgde, krijgt een introspectieve, bij vlagen melancholische invulling. Vrees niet, het album blijft ver uit de buurt van een muzikale versie van het wanhopigere segment van de ingezonden brievenrubriek van de Ouders van Nu. Sterker, MTT heeft een knap, doorleefd en urgent album gemaakt, speciaal voor iedereen die weet hoe het voelt als de tijd je door de vingers glipt. De gloedvolle en wonderlijk geslaagde poging de jaren tachtig te mixen met een actuele sound, zijn een voorlopige kroon op de samenwerking tussen zangeres Anne Broekman, producer Maarten Besseling en drummer Jos Terlingen. Het resultaat sluit nog nadrukkelijker aan bij de internationale ambities die de band met het debuut over de grenzen al op de kaart zette. Met het secuur afgestelde samenspel tussen diepe bassen en vervreemdende sounds ontpopt MTT zich nog meer als \u00e9\u00e9n van de meest verfrissende Nederlandse acts.

The band began with humble beginnings as childhood friends forging their love of music into their own band, and over the past 16 years they've grown to become a meticulous killing militia primed to join the bigger league and take things to a more international playing field. Forming under the name \"Atrosity\" in 2001, the band recorded their debut 5-song E.P. in early 2005 after many formative years of learning old school metal classic tunes from the likes of Metallica, Iron Maiden, Slayer and Judas Priest. This 5-song EP, appropriately titled \"Fuck Everything\", was the group's first step in their long journey from leaving the confines of Colfax, CA to the world beyond as Atrosity quickly established themselves as the true, young thrash metal band in the Northern California area. 2005 also cemented the young band's reputation further as they opened for thrash metal legends Kreator and Overkill in Sacramento, CA giving them a taste of professional live performances. In 2006, Atrostiy was forced to undergo a name change due to their being an established death metal band from Germany using the proper English spelling of Atrocity. Quickly deciding on the ultra-heavy alternate name of Devastator, the band continued the metal mayhem as the now revamped headbanging force and needed a release with the new name to get the word out to all the ravenous followers as well as potential new fans they would set out to convert. Devastator recorded a 5-song EP, titled \"Crush and Kill\", which was recorded completely live in the studio in two days. Released on Friday, October 13th, \"Crush and Kill\" quickly lived up and passed its predecessor to further spread the band's name and reputation. Devastator spent most of 2007 playing up and down California with fellow up and coming new thrash bands such as Merciless Death, Hatchet, and Warbringer, as well as with national touring acts such as Kreator (twice), Sodom, Three Inches of Blood, Napalm Death, Overkill (twice), Hirax, and Dragonlord. In the fall of 2007, Devastator once again headed off to the studio, this time in Petaluma, CA, to record their follow-up EP, \"Slaughtered Like Pigs\", with the help of the then current drummer of Hatchet and Slave Productions. With their new recording Devastator joined their Bay Area brothers-in-arms Hatchet on a west coast tour blazing a path of destruction. Pushing ever forward, Devastator spent 2008 touring all over the west coast doing random dates alongside notable names like M.O.D., Heathen and Agent Steel, in addition to signing a publishing agreement with Marco Barbieri's Salem Rose Music. In 2009, Devastator geared up to record their next demo recording, the far more professional \"Burn the Beast\" EP sessions at Trident Studios, which was recorded, mixed and mastered in a week by Juan Urteaga (Testament, Machine Head, Sadus). \"Burn the Beast\" received rave press reviews and metal radio airplay across the country and to build upon the momentum the band embarked on a full US tour that summer, dubbed the \"Slaughtering the Masses\" tour, spreading their music and making new fans in over 40 cities. Upon returning home the band realized they had learned a lot from the experience and pulled back making themselves inactive despite a few one-off stints in 2010 from the aggressive live show routine and began making general improvements to their sound, musicianship, vocals and new material. Aiming to join the big leagues Devastator felt the need for another new name that was more unique and original and dubbed themselves Blessed Curse - because being in a band is both a blessing and a curse. In 2011 with an arsenal of new songs the band headed back to Trident Studios with producer Juan Urteaga to record the full-length album of their self-titled Blessed Curse debut. True metal performed with integrity highlighting the band's distinct take on their metal influences and capturing the past, present and future of Blessed Curse. Packaged with a killer original artwork piece from Marc Sasso (Dio, Halford, Cage), Blessed Curse are ready to take it to the next level and have partnered with Cyclone Empire Records to make that next leap possible. Released in the US under Marco Barbieri's record label M-Theory Audio, the Blessed Curse debut album is available world-wide for the metal masses. Since the completion of their debut, the band returned to the live front assaulting audiences with their intense barrage of metal mayhem and sharing stages all over the west coast with bands like Death Angel, Destruction, D.R.I., Evil Dead, Bonded by Blood, Exmortus, Sacrificial Slaughter, and Witchaven. 2016 has brought a new era to the band. Enlisting 6-string shredder Gregg Laubacher on guitar alongside original members Tyler Satterlee on guitar and vocals as well as Derek Bean on drums, B.C. completed the brand new recording titled \"Beware of the Night\" in 2017. Bringing the band back to Trident Studios with the work of Juan Urteaga the recording session marked the third experience of working at Trident and the result was the most punishing, crushing, and pummeling cut of sonic metal music that Blessed Curse has released to date. Bringing five new tracks to life including the first lyric video for the featured song \"Nightbreed\", Beware of the Night was released in the U.S. under the M-Theory Audio label. Pushing forward with new music and an even more fierce determination to bring B.C. to the wider world, countless shows and more headbanging music await the future of Blessed Curse.

From the jump, the song whips up a frenzy, shifting directions on a dime but never losing sight of The Last Gang\u2019s pop-indebted ethos.

Perez, the band\u2019s drummer, once called their powerhouse mix of rock, Tex-Mex, country, folk, R&B, blues and traditional Spanish and Mexican music \u201cthe soundtrack of the barrio.\u201d Three decades, two more Grammys, a worldwide smash single (\u201cLa Bamba\u201d) and thousands of rollicking performances across the globe later, Los Lobos is surviving quite well -- and still jamming with the same raw intensity as they had when they began in that garage in 1973. The band chronicles a key moment of their expansive journey on Disconnected In New York City, a dynamic live album that marks the band\u2019s 40th anniversary and launches their new association with 429 Records.\n\n\n\nRecorded over two nights in December 2012 at The City Winery in NYC, the engaging 12-song set celebrates Los Lobos\u2019 great legacy as a freewheeling and unpredictable live band, which most recently includes touring in Europe with Neil Young and Crazy Horse in June 2013. Disconnected in New York City features fresh interpretations of songs from throughout their three decade recording career, including their first ever live recording of \u201cLa Bamba,\u201d their worldwide pop crossover hit from the 1987 film which reached #1 on the U.S. and UK singles chart and whose video won a 1988 MTV Music Video Award. The collection covers the band\u2019s 25 year studio discography, from \u201cGotta Let You Know\u201d (a bouncy zydeco rocker driven by Hidalgo\u2019s accordion from How Will The Wolf Survive?) through \u201cTin Can Trust,\u201d a bluesy rock ballad that was the title cut from their last studio release in 2010.\n\n\n\nBy design, Disconnected in New York City has songs that have been longtime staples of Los Lobos\u2019 tours mixed with other gems that had somehow fallen by the wayside over the years. The mix includes the mid-tempo shuffling rocker title track from The Neighborhood (1990); the easy flowing and whimsical (thanks to Berlin\u2019s jazzy sax solo) \u201cOh Yeah\u201d (from This Time, 1999); the spirited, traditional flavored, Rosas penned Spanish language \u201cChuco\u2019s Cumbia\u201d (from The Town and the City, 2006); the graceful and spiritual \u201cTears of God\u201d (from By The Light of the Moon, 1987); \u201cLa Venganza de Los Pelados,\u201d a fiery burst of Latin rock fusion with mariachi textures (from The Ride, 2004); the soulful, simmering blues of \u201cLittle Things\u201d (from The Town and The City, 2006); the Latin blues funk classic \u201cSet Me Free Rosa Lee\u201d (from By The Light of the Moon); and two mid tempo funk pop/rock tunes from 2002\u2019s Good Morning Aztlan, \u201cMaria Christina\u201d and \u201cMalaque.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs per the literal meaning of its title, Disconnected In New York City sets itself apart from Los Lobos\u2019 other acclaimed live recordings (most notably, 2005\u2019s Live At the Fillmore) by stripping down the instrumentation for a mostly acoustic affair. Lozano, who drives the grooves with his bass and also plays the deep-bodied Mexican 6-string acoustic bass called the guitarron, says, \u201cIt\u2019s funny because when the venue hired us, they specifically requested that we do something acoustic to fit its smaller dinner house vibe. The idea popped into our heads to ask them if we could record it and they were cool with that.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well known for our electric, high energy performances but we\u2019ve done acoustic stuff for certain smaller auditorium tours,\u201d he says. \u201cPlaying these songs acoustically makes them feel more intimate. We notice that when you play softer and quieter, the audience tends to pay attention to everything we\u2019re doing. When you play rock, they\u2019re thinking more about rhythm than melodies and lyrics, but playing them this way allows for more subtle elements of the songs to stand out.\u201d\n\n\n\nPerez laughs when he calls the Los Lobos Unplugged experience \u201cfolk music for the hearing impaired - it\u2019s still loud because the acoustic instruments are amplified! The idea of making a record like this came from never having the opportunity to work some of our favorite songs from over the years into our usual sets. Because most tours are done in support of new albums, the fresh material we play means that some favorite older tunes fall away over time. When we thought about making another live album and what would make it different, the logical concept was to revisit songs we haven\u2019t played in a while but had been requested by a lot of fans. We had already documented our rock show with Fillmore, so we felt kind of liberated to take another approach with this one.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are two challenges releasing a live album, though,\u201d Perez continues. \u201cOne is choosing certain songs over other ones. It\u2019s like having kids. We love Tommy as much as Johnny but one day Johnny gets to go the park today and Johnny stays home. In spite of this, we do cover a lot of ground. The biggest problem is the way people sometimes perceive live albums, like they\u2019re an afterthought put out to fill some kind of gap. Bands love doing them but fans don\u2019t always pay attention. But historically, it can be a license for great creativity. Jimi Hendrix did Band of Gypsies to fulfill his last recording commitment, but it was one of the most incredible recordings he ever made. Because Disconnected in New York City marks a key anniversary and the start of us working with a new label, we put a lot of thought into the project, from its design and structure and how we performed the songs.\u201d\n\n\n\nSteve Berlin is Los Lobos\u2019 saxophonist, flutist and harmonica player who met the band while still with seminal L.A. rockers The Blasters. He joined the group after performing on and co-producing (with T-Bone Burnett) their breakthrough 1983 EP \u2026And A Time To Dance. Though he wasn\u2019t jamming with the others way back in the \u201cKrypton days\u201d (as Perez calls it) in the barrio garage, Berlin felt it was important to find a special way to mark his cohorts\u2019 40th year--just as they had done on their 30th by inviting special guests (Dave Alvin, Bobby Womack, Elvis Costello, Mavis Staples) to be part of their 2004 date The Ride.\n\n\n\n\u201cTrying to figure out a way to acknowledge 40 years as a band is harder than you might think,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got to play with all of our heroes on our 30th so what was something we had not done? So, like Louie said, we thought the best thing was to bring back songs we rarely if ever play and put them into a fresh context. We wanted to create something of value for our fans that would reflect the mutual appreciation we share with them \u2013 starting, of course, with \u2018La Bamba,\u2019 which we had never documented live before. I think it was important also that once we knew the set lists for the shows that we would eventually choose the final tracking from, we didn\u2019t over-think the arrangements. We only rehearsed these shows for a single day. The coolest part of how Disconnected worked out is that we hadn\u2019t been doing some of these songs long enough to worry about how to pull them off. And because we performed them acoustically, we couldn\u2019t just blast everyone with power and skate through them. We had to be present and make the choices that occurred to us in each moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nAround the time of their last big anniversary Rolling Stone magazine summed up that distinctive, diverse and spontaneous Los Lobos aesthetic perfectly: \u201cThis is what happens when five guys create a magical sound, then stick together for 30 years to see how far it can take them.\u201d Most fans know that the group came together from three separate units. Hidalgo, the band\u2019s lead vocalist/guitarist (whose arsenal includes accordion, percussion, bass, keyboards, melodic, drums, violin and banjo) met Perez at Garfield High in East LA and started a garage band. Rosas, who plays guitar and mandolin, had his own group, and Lozano launched a power trio. \u201cBut we all hung out because we were friends and making music was just the natural progression of things,\u201d says Perez. \u201cLike if you hang around a barbershop long enough, you\u2019re going to get a haircut.\u201d\n\n\n\nLooking back at the historical and cultural sweep of the band, Lozano sees the release of Disconnected In New York City as Los Lobos coming full circle. \u201cA lot of people forget that though we were rock musicians when we got out of high school, the band started off as an acoustic outfit,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to play Mexican folk music because those were our roots and there was this whole Chicano awareness thing happening back in the early 70s. We started to pay attention to our traditions and culture, and focused on those styles of music for years. We studied music from every region of Mexico, learned how to play all these authentic instruments. So that\u2019s what we did for ten years until we decided to play rock again by bringing in drum and electric bass.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were playing this restaurant gig for two years, and some small local clubs, playing the same songs, when people in the crowd started shouting out, \u2018Do you know any Beatles or Grateful Dead tunes?\u2019\u201d Lozano adds. \u201cSoon we got fired from the restaurant and headed back to the garage to write our first original songs that were rock with some accordion on them: \u2018Let\u2019s Say Goodnight\u2019 and \u2018How Much Can I Do?\u2019 We made a little tape and gave it to the guys in The Blasters, which included Steve Berlin, when we went to see them live on Sunset Strip. They loved our tunes and invited us to open their show at the Whiskey-A-Go-Go, which was the first time Los Lobos performed on the other side of the Los Angeles River. We played some originals and old favorites by Hendrix, Cream, The Yardbirds and Beatles \u2013 all the stuff we loved as kids. The icing on the cake is that the audience loved it, too.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 7pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Friday December 27"}, {"Address": "23 Petaluma Blvd N, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Total Chaos", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.640098, 38.233411], "Date": "Sat Jan 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-11", "Genre": "Genres: Punk", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Mystic Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // Ages 21+ // $23 Advance & $28 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "Burning Down the house", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8122223.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Sat Jan 11 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-11", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Rnb-soul, Funk, Dance Pop, Pop, R&b/soul", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room", "moreBioInfo": "Burning Down The House, opgericht in Heerlen en sinds 2015 woonachtig in Amsterdam.

Daniel Casares, naci\u00f3 con duende y as\u00ed lo demuestra con su guitarra, que suena original, distinta, con una adecuada personalidad propia, reflejando esa furia interior, que desata poderosamente sobre sus cuerdas. La carrera profesional de Daniel Casares es prematura. Con tan solo 13 a\u00f1os, participa en la grabaci\u00f3n del disco colectivo, \"A la Guitarra de Estepona \". Con 16 a\u00f1os es galardonado con el prestigioso Bord\u00f3n minero de La Uni\u00f3n, convirti\u00e9ndose en el guitarrista m\u00e1s joven, hasta la fecha, en conseguirlo. Adem\u00e1s, se alza con el premio nacional de guitarra de Ja\u00e9n y esto le posibilita para grabar su primer disco \u201cDuende Flamenco\u201d ese mismo a\u00f1o, aunque luego no se publicar\u00eda hasta 1.999, con 19 a\u00f1os. Su entra\u00f1abilidad musical est\u00e1 \u00edntimamente hermanada al Maestro Juanito Valderrama a quien acompa\u00f1\u00f3 en sus \u00faltimos a\u00f1os; de ello deja constancia el disco \u201cDon Juan\u201d grabado en directo en el festival flamenco de La Uni\u00f3n (Murcia). Tambi\u00e9n el mundo de la l\u00edrica ha podido disfrutar de Daniel Casares, puesto que la mezzosoprano Cecilia Bartoli, le pidi\u00f3 que le acompa\u00f1ara, en calidad de artista invitado, en su gira europea con motivo de la presentaci\u00f3n y homenaje a la diva Mar\u00eda Malibr\u00e1n. En cuanto a premios y reconocimientos, Daniel Casares fue nombrado \"Revelaci\u00f3n Musical\" de 2005 en Nueva York, otorgado por la asociaci\u00f3n de cronistas de espect\u00e1culos ACE. En 2010 fue elegido por una comitiva internacional, para representar a la cultura europea, en la gala de presentaci\u00f3n a los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, de la Expo 2010 de Shangai. Son incontables las colaboraciones de Daniel Casares con otros artistas, de otros mundos de la cultura art\u00edstica y mundana, ser\u00eda sencillo, por tanto dejar nombres en el tintero, pero dentro de la m\u00fasica ha colaborado en directo, con personajes de reconocido prestigio como Alejandro Sanz, Miguel Poveda, Dulce Pontes , Pasi\u00f3n Vega, Noa, Toquinho, Antonio Orozco, Jos\u00e9 Merc\u00e9, , etc\u2026 Fruto de estas colaboraciones, Alejandro Sanz se convirti\u00f3 en editor de su 5\u00ba disco \u201cEl ladr\u00f3n del agua\u201d. En la actualidad, colabora en directo y musicando algunas de las obras de Dulce Pontes y Miguel Poveda. En Julio de 2014 estrena \u201cLa luna de Alejandra\u201d junto a la Orquesta Filarm\u00f3nica de M\u00e1laga, su primera obra sinf\u00f3nica para guitarra y orquesta. Orquestada y dirigida por el maestro Jos\u00e9 Miguel \u00c9vora . En 2015 a\u00f1ade a su repertorio sinf\u00f3nico el \u201cConcierto de Aranjuez\u201d de Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo, proponi\u00e9ndolo en un mismo repertorio junto a su obra \u201cLa luna de Alejandra\u201d. Daniel con la propuesta flamenca y la sinf\u00f3nica, acude cada a\u00f1o a los mejores festivales de guitarra, jazz, flamenco o worldmusic. En Octubre de 2015 presenta, este, su 6\u00ba trabajo discogr\u00e1fico, Picassares, en el que vuelve su esencia m\u00e1s flamenca y con el que homenajea al pintor Pablo Picasso. En este disco de 10 temas cuenta con colaboraciones de aut\u00e9ntico lujo, como en una chans\u00f3n que representa la muerte de Picasso, que canta Dulce Pontes, con letra de Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ares. Tambi\u00e9n aparece el contrabajista israel\u00ed Adam Ben Ezra y uno de los cantaores que acompa\u00f1aran a Paco de Luc\u00eda en sus \u00faltimas actuaciones, Rubio de Pruna, poni\u00e9ndole voz a unos fandangos.

John has also been heavily supported by Chicago house legend Gene Farris who recruited him to become an integral part of his record label, Farris Wheel Recordings. The first single, \u201cGuest List,\u201d a collaboration with Dead Space, has since become the highest charting track in the label\u2019s history.\n\nMaintaining a steady stream of releases, John has made a habit of scaling the Beatport top charts. With dance floor weapons like \u201cTrompetas\u201d and \u201cTouch Me\u201d, which went on to be the highest selling track on Psycho Disco, John\u2019s productions bring the groove back to house music with stirring beats that ignite the senses.

The original ensemble was a trio with Tim Sawyer on guitar and vocals, Michael DiPirro on bass and vocals, and Johnny Downer on guitar and vocals. They focused their sound on acoustic music. Genres included folk, bluegrass and hints of old- timey and American traditionals. With the growing demand to play in venues requiring more electric music, they brought in Sonoma county drummer, Bradley Leach in 2002. The band began a new path, incorporating electric bass and guitar, but still keeping its original feel and its acoustic- based repertoire alive. In 2005, drummer, James Foster, replaced Leach as drummer and trombone great, Jason Thor, entered into the scene. With the addition of Foster/Thor, came yet another shift in the band\u2019s musical evolution. Rock, Jazz , Soul, Reggae, and Funk became apparent in their writing styles. Then came the untimely death of Downer in 2009. As a result, the band changed its personnel temporarily. DiPirro was replaced by Mark Calderone on bass and Karl Kummerle on violin. The band incorporated Kummerle\u2019s gypsy jazz sounds and Calderone\u2019s rock steady bass playing. Then in 2011, DiPirro returned and with him came the addition of Nick Hasty on tenor sax, flute, and vocals and Jesse Shantor on alto and baritone sax. This is the current line-up to date. The horns brought yet another shift in the band\u2019s musical evolution. New Orleans and bebop came into the foreground. Yet Sawyer and DiPirro, whom have always been the principle songwriters, maintain that acoustic, vocal-based context in the songwriting and performances overall. Free Peoples have been called \u201c Porch rock pros\u201d , and their songwriting is\u201d sophisticated with twists and turns that take the music several steps from the unexpected\u201d. They have quietly become one of the best American roots bands. As of 2013, they have three studio albums and one live album to date.

Lynn (lead guitar, vocals) and Arrica Rose (lead vocals, guitar) met on a spring evening at the Huntington Beach Library in Southern CA when Arrica was still a teenager and Mark was just a few years older. Her local punk band (Uxby) was opening for his touring band (Uranium 9 volt). They had a brief conversation involving their mutual Italian heritage and New York family roots. Fast forward many moons later, they re-met in San Francisco at Hotel Utah under similar circumstances. The stars aligned and their bands once again shared a stage, Arrica playing with her project Arrica Rose & the \u2026\u2019s and Mark with his, The Devil\u2019s Own. After the show, Mark recalled their initial meeting, much to Arrica\u2019s surprise. Within a few months a long distance love began and Arrica was arranging to spend a lot more time in the Bay Area (traveling up from Los Angeles). Just like that, Dear County was born.\n\n\n\nDear County was initially founded upon a mutual love of country music. Mark and Arrica began writing songs intending to start a simple classic country band. But given their vast and eclectic love of many genres their songwriting expanded toward 60\u2019s Soul, 70\u2019s Rock n\u2019 Roll, and California Country while also adding the impossible to avoid indie rock influences. Drawing inspiration from artists like Gram Parsons, Eagles, Dusty Springfield, Big Star, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, and The Replacements the aim of Dear County soon evolved into paying respects to their influences while creating something uniquely their own. Once a handful of songs were in place Michael Smartt (drums), Nelson Saarni (bass, vocals), and Julia Napier (percussion, vocals) got on board to create the five-piece band Dear County is today.\n\n\n\nLow Country was produced by Dear County and recorded by Lee Bothwick at Jingletown Recording in Oakland, CA with additional recording by Arrica Rose at The Treehouse.

Layered and lustrous, the music on her new full-length release, The Pieces Left, radiates from an organic center colored by electronic shadings and beats. As sonic light breaks through the opaque mist of a dense soundscape, the sound mirrors the drama of her locale: San Francisco, home to generations of visionaries. \u201cNothing is more dreamlike than the adventure of walking in this city,\u201d she says. \u201cI look out my window to see people in the street, a bus moving, a couple fighting on the corner, a homeless man. The inspiration for the album comes from what I visualize everyday.\u201d In addition to crafting the recordings, Francesca has been headlining with her band The New Believers at high profile NoCal venues like Yoshi\u2019s, Caf\u00e9 Du Nord and her home base, Hotel Utah. Selected for inclusion for the KFOG Local Scene 6 CD, Francesca was featured in a live broadcast and interview from San Jose on the station\u2019s Morning Show to celebrate the station\u2019s Local Music Month where she was greeted by a line of fans familiar with her song \u201cMaybe Today\u201d from its regular radio rotation. Additionally, she was featured in a live performance and an on camera interview on KOFYTV 20 Cable 13 in San Francisco and selected as an artist for \u201cBorn To Play Live Acoustic\u201d for Gap, Inc., when the retail giant hosted live music in 700 stores nationwide. Attracting cross-cultural audiences is her trademark: the mix of acoustic roots and electronic edges that she titles \u201cIntrospective Dream Pop\u201d resonates to a wide spectrum of listeners including artsy indie kids and fans of serious songwriting. The daughter of a Polish mother and a Japanese-born Korean father, Francesca grew up between the Bay Area and Texas. She graduated from high school in Alameda, California where she says she \u201ckept to myself and wrote songs.\u201d Her dream was to live in England. Accepted into the prestigious Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA) the college founded by Sir Paul McCartney, Francesca raised tuition money with street performances and personal fundraisers. \u201cDoing that set my foundation for what I do now \u2013 organizing and promoting music. I knew I could make it happen if I really wanted it,\u201d she notes. As a creator, Francesca incorporates an intuitive approach to songwriting. \u201cI have to feel that it comes from the subconscious, from another place. I can feel the story coming out as I let the words channel through me. Some of it is random, but if keep doing this I will get a lyric, or a feeling about what to write about. After that, I just let it flow and then I start making sense of it. But in the beginning I let the music come from my soul.\u201d This soul connection reverberates within The Pieces Left, in the wistful questions and celebratory moments that inhabit her songs. \u201cI always have hope,\u201d she says. \u201cThese songs are more of an observation than anything.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, USA", "Artist": "Jerry Portnoy", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/148946.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Sun Jan 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Festival", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "*Mark Hummel's Blues Harmonica Blowout with Magic Dick, Lee Oskar, Jerry Portnoy, and Duke Robillard (1/12/20)"}, {"Address": "2937 Mission, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Danny Castro", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.417887, 37.750037], "Date": "Sun Jan 12 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-12", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Savanna Jazz Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Savanna Jazz Jam with Eric Tillman, Danny Castro, and Nick Fishman at Savanna Jazz Club: Savanna stands out in its neighborhood: it's almost as if a North Beach jazz club dropped a spore on Mission Street.

Vrees niet, het album blijft ver uit de buurt van een muzikale versie van het wanhopigere segment van de ingezonden brievenrubriek van de Ouders van Nu. Sterker, MTT heeft een knap, doorleefd en urgent album gemaakt, speciaal voor iedereen die weet hoe het voelt als de tijd je door de vingers glipt. De gloedvolle en wonderlijk geslaagde poging de jaren tachtig te mixen met een actuele sound, zijn een voorlopige kroon op de samenwerking tussen zangeres Anne Broekman, producer Maarten Besseling en drummer Jos Terlingen. Het resultaat sluit nog nadrukkelijker aan bij de internationale ambities die de band met het debuut over de grenzen al op de kaart zette. Met het secuur afgestelde samenspel tussen diepe bassen en vervreemdende sounds ontpopt MTT zich nog meer als \u00e9\u00e9n van de meest verfrissende Nederlandse acts.

Especially for an artist who, just years before, sold out Madison Square Garden for three consecutive nights. CHAD \u201cCHADWICK\u201d STOKES is anything but a typical rock star. So, there he was, wading across a river to escape the chasing railroad bulls and hanging in the different down and out jungles with other traveling folks. And in the end, after the three had finally reached the West Coast and were laying face down in the dirt at gunpoint care of the NSA, he says it was all well worth it. \u201cI had ridden the trains a little bit in the past for a day or two but I had never done it for weeks at a time,\u201d Stokes says. \u201cI discovered an America that I knew was out there but had limited experience with. There's all kinds of people out on the rails: people simply trying to get from point A to B, people running from whatever they left behind, people with nowhere else to go. You get to see a part of America that only the trains go through -- remote stretches without any sign of mankind.\" It was out on these long isolated stretches and in the inner city train yards that Stokes found the inspiration for his solo debut, titled SIMMERKANE II. While riding the rails, Stokes made a designated stop so his band, State Radio, could play an anti-war concert at the Denver Coliseum with Rage Against The Machine. It is a DIY social consciousness that Stokes came to early in life - growing up as a pacifist, working in Zimbabwe after high school and eventually co-founding the Elias Fund, the Dispatch Foundation, and now Calling All Crows. In 2008, Stokes was honored as Humanitarian of the Year at the Boston Music Awards. Simmerkane II, a proper follow-up to the State Radio EP (Simmerkane I), is a marked evolution in the musician-songwriter\u2019s creative journey. Produced by John Dragonetti (of The Submarines), the album features background vocals from Carly Simon, Matt Embree (Rx Bandits), The White Buffalo, Blake Hazard (The Submarines), and Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars. The sound is an engaging mix of Americana, country, folk and rock in the service of some undeniably evocative lyrics. The songs tell a loose narrative of travel, love and loss, like some re-imagined rock-n-roll odyssey. The journey begins with \u201cAdelaide,\u201d a fuzzed-out melodic folk rocker containing the prophetic line, \u201cWe left Worcester with our boots and our bags - and America undressed herself in front of our eyes.\u201d Next, listeners venture into the \u201cCrowbar Hotel\u201d to discover an underground world populated by hard luck outsiders: \u201cWe are sold to the highest bidder, we are down to our very last crumb - May we invite ourselves to dinner, \u2018cause we might just have to make a run.\u201d The song \u201cBack To The Races,\u201d has Stokes reflecting on past mistakes and longing for the childhood farm while still seduced by the excitement of the journey and a new love. The symphonic rock-n-roll charges ahead before dropping down for the intimate lyrical refrain \u201cBack to the races - and on with the day.\u201d The two-disc deluxe package includes three bonus tracks with Sierra Leone\u2019s Refugee All Stars, a musical ensemble of refugees from Sierra Leone\u2019s 1991 civil war. Stokes, who did humanitarian work in Zimbabwe as a youth, has been a longtime fan of the All Stars. The tracks include a lilting African-tinged folk song called \u201cCoffee And Wine,\u201d a reflective reggae track titled, \u201cAll My Possessions (Ode To Troy)\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Have You\u201d \u2013 a heartfelt ballad that eventually erupts in celebration with the All Stars\u2019 backing vocals and percussions carrying the weight of their troubled history and eventual transcendence. \u201cIt was such an honor to work with the All Stars,\u201d Stokes explains. \u201cThe songs we did were kind of folk songs and one reggae song, so they were a bit out of their element trying to adapt to the folky farm kid and his songs. But you can hear their history in their singing and playing and it adds this amazing power to the songs.\u201d Simmerkane II is an ambitious album about discovery, loss and moving on. What begun as a journey across an unseen America becomes a moving musical tribute to the resilience of the human heart. \u201cThe album was initially inspired by the freight train trip with my brother and that vast underworld that exists out there,\u201d Stokes explains. \u201cBut then it\u2019s also about growing up on the farm and losing loved ones; a young man learning about life.\u201d In his spare time, Stokes can still be found hopping trains with his beloved travel companion, Lefty.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\n\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\n\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\n\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers. While he may be considered as part of a new generation of \"multilingual\" musicians which have grown up studying classical, jazz and Latin American music, Edward is inventing a language that transcends any rigid genre.", "otherInfo": "The meditative and expressive works of Catalan composer Federico Mompou fit the intimate Salon setting perfectly. Mompou was considered a master of the short character piece. These selections showcase the composer\u2019s ability to write instantly memorable material that evokes a wide range of moods, from desolation to uninhibited joy.\n\nEdward Simon, a native of Venezuela, has made a name for himself over decades in America as a jazz improviser, composer-arranger, band leader and educator. DownBeat has called him \u201cone of the strongest pianists of his generation, with intuitive empathy and drum-like ingenuity,\u201d while Jazz Journal International has singled out \u201chis deep emotional statements\u201d as a composer and improviser. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area as a member of the all-star SFJAZZ Collective, he has been a Guggenheim Fellow along with being awarded multiple composition grants as part of the Chamber Music America\u2019s New Jazz Works initiative. Simon, a Yamaha artist, has recorded 15 albums as a leader or co-leader. His latest is Sorrows and Triumphs, released via Sunnyside Records in April 2018; the album was declared \u201cunmissable\u201d in Nate Chinen\u2019s Take Five column on WBGO.org, and the pianist was featured in an extensive DownBeat interview upon the disc\u2019s release. This follows Simon\u2019s 2016 album Latin American Songbook, which won him an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Jazz Album; a four-and-a-half-star DownBeat review also praised his fresh vision of classic Latin American songs as \u201cgrand and sophisticated.\u201d\n\nAnother key release for Simon was his 2014 Sunnyside album Venezuelan Suite, which saw the pianist blend the tuneful, buoyant sounds of his native country with the harmonically sophisticated, forward-looking manner of jazz. All About Jazz marveled: \u201cVenezuelan Suite\u2026 is the perfect confluence of Venezuelan ideals, jazz language and chamber-esque sophistication. In short, it\u2019s a masterpiece.\u201d One of Simon\u2019s most recent collaborative projects is the trio Steel House, with the pianist joined by bassist Scott Colley and drummer Brian Blade for a group that blends acoustic jazz improvisation with electronic-tinged atmospherics for an inviting, song-oriented sound. This virtuoso trio has performed at top venues across the country, with L.A.

Two Super-Bowl appearances, Pollstar Box Office chart-topping tours with Def Leppard, Journey, Boston, REO Speedwagon, Bad Company (to name only a few), two more studio albums and no end in sight, STYX continues to conquer the planet, one venue at a time.\n\nSpawned from a suburban Chicago basement in the early \u201870s, Styx would eventually transform into the virtual arena rock prototype by the late '70s and early '80s, due to a fondness for big rockers and soaring power ballads.\n\nEarly on, Styx's music reflected such then-current prog rockers as Emerson, Lake & Palmer and the Moody Blues, as evidenced by such releases as 1972's self-titled debut, 1973's Styx II, 1974's The Serpent Is Rising, and 1975's Man of Miracles. While the albums (as well as non-stop touring) helped the group build a substantial following locally, Styx failed to break through to the mainstream, until a track originally from their second album, \"Lady\" started to get substantial airplay in late '74 on the Chicago radio station WLS-FM. The song was soon issued as a single nationwide, and quickly shot to number six on the singles chart, as Styx II was certified gold. By this time, however, the group had grown disenchanted with their record label, and opted to sign on with A&M for their fifth release overall, 1975's Equinox (their former label would issue countless compilations over the years, culled from tracks off their early releases). On the eve of the tour in support of the album, original guitarist John Curulewski abruptly left the band, and was replaced by Tommy Shaw. Shaw proved to be the missing piece of the puzzle for Styx, as most of their subsequent releases throughout the late '70s earned at least platinum certification (1976's Crystal Ball, 1977's The Grand Illusion, 1978's Pieces of Eight, and 1979's Cornerstone), and spawned such hit singles and classic rock radio standards as \"Come Sail Away,\" \"Renegade,\" \"Blue Collar Man\" and \"Fooling Yourself.\u201d\n\nThe band decided that their first release of the '80s would be a concept album, 1981's Paradise Theater, which was loosely based on the rise and fall of a once-beautiful theater (which was supposedly used as a metaphor for the state of the U.S. at the time -- the Iranian hostage situation, the Cold War, Reagan, etc.). Paradise Theater became Styx's biggest hit of their career (selling over three million copies in a three-year period), as they became one of the U.S. top rock acts due to such big hit singles as \"Too Much Time on My Hands\". It also marked the first time in history that a band released four consecutive triple-platinum albums.\n\nA career-encompassing live album, Caught in the Act, was issued in 1984, before Styx went on hiatus, and the majority of its members pursued solo projects throughout the remainder of the decade.

Although grief-stricken, Styx persevered with new drummer Todd Sucherman taking the place of Panozzo, as the Styx reunion tour became a surprise sold-out success, resulting in the release of a live album/video, 1997's \"Return to Paradise,\" while a whole new generation of rock fans were introduced to the grandiose sounds of Styx via a humorous car ad which used the track \"Mr. Roboto,\" as well as songs used in such TV shows as South Park and Freaks & Geeks.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "222 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Sophie Tucker", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.409274, 37.785697], "Date": "Wed Jan 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-15", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Feinstein's at The Nikko", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Feinstein\u2019s at the Nikko celebrates the return of Bay Area native, celebrated songstress and Tony Award-nominated performer, Sharon McNight.

Musical success is seldom measured in time spans of more than a few years, if not Andy Warhol's often quoted \"fifteen minutes\", so the fact that by the time Midge's single \"If I Was\" went to No1 in 1985 he had already crammed several musical lifetimes into a 10 year professional career speaks volumes - Slik, The Rich Kids, Thin Lizzy, Visage, Ultravox and of course the most famous one off group in musical history Band Aid had by then all had the guiding hand of his musical navigation.\n\nThen you have to take account of Midge's musical directorship of a series of rock concerts for The Prince's Trust, Night of the Proms, Wicked Women for Breakthrough and in honour of Nelson Mandela; record production for Phil Lynott, Steve Harley and countless others; his video direction of memorable hits by the Fun Boy Three, Bananarama and others, or a whole swathe of landmark singles by Ultravox; TV, theatre and film music credits ranging from 'Max Headroom' to stage and big screen.\n\nMidge appeared to the wider public in a moment of heady teen success with Slik. Their sway-along single 'Forever And Ever' took over at No.1 in the UK from Abba's 'Mamma Mia' on Valentine's Day 1976. Soon outgrowing Slik's pop dimensions, Midge was snapped up by ex-Sex Pistol Glen Matlock the following year for his new outfit, the Rich Kids, who charted amid an avalanche of press with a self-titled EMI single early in 1978. By 1979, with his name being added to many musicians' contact book, Ure had been asked by Billy Currie, Chris Cross and Warren Cann to become the new frontman in Ultravox.\n\nThe band was a major influence on the new romantic and electro-pop movements of the early '80s. Their successful trademark was combining Midge's powerful guitar riffs with sweeping synthesiser motifs, enigmatic imagery and state-of-the-art visuals. Tracks like 'Reap the Wild Wind', 'Dancing With Tears in My Eyes', 'Love's Great Adventure' and 1981's timeless 'Vienna' were all massive hits the world over as they charted with awesome regularity, not only on single, but with seven consecutive top ten albums in just six years. Indeed, Vienna recently was voted the Nation\u2019s favourite number 2 single of the 80\u2019s, finally granting it a coveted Number 1 position!\n\nEven by then, the Midge Ure story had some individual chapters, of course. He wrote and produced \u201cFade to Grey\u201d for Visage in 1980, then hit the top 10 in the summer of 1982 with his first release under his own name, an atmospheric take on the Tom Rush song made famous half a dozen years earlier by the Walker Brothers, 'No Regrets'.\nThen came November 25, 1984, a historic day for Midge and all of pop music, as 36 artists by the collective name Band Aid gathered at SARM Studios in west London under Ure's production. They recorded 'Do They Know It's Christmas?' a song he had just written with Bob Geldof as the industry's heartfelt and eloquent contribution to Ethiopian famine relief. 600,000 copies sold in its first week in the UK alone was only the beginning: 800,000 more were bought in the second week, more than three million world-wide, and the unstoppable emotion engendered by the project led to Live Aid, the summer 1985 global concert that, all exaggeration aside, spoke for a generation.\nWithin months, a staggering \u00a38 million had been raised for the starving in Africa, and Geldof said that without Ure's initial enthusiasm for the idea, not to mention his rapidly penned sketch for the single, neither Band Aid nor Live Aid could have happened.\n\nJust two months after Live Aid, Midge was back at No.1 in Britain, this time under his own name, with 'If I Was', and by the autumn he had a No.2 solo album to accompany it, entitled 'The Gift'. Further solo albums followed with \u201cAnswers to Nothing\u201d in 1988 and \u201cPure\u201d in 1991 on BMG.\n\nDelivered in 1994, the new 'Breathe' album was followed by further extensive touring. The Swatch campaign brought spectacular renewed international activity for the record in 1998. The album and eponymous single were subsequently in the top 20 throughout Europe for much of that year, and No.1 in Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 'Breathe' sold over half a million copies in Europe alone. Respected German composer Eberhard Schoener invited him to perform at the re-opening of the Potzdamer Platz in Berlin, in front of an estimated audience of 500,000.\n\nSoon after Midge was busy producing and writing with and for various artists, both established and unsigned, at his studio in Bath, and writing music for films. Other duties included the 'Music for Montserrat' benefit at the Royal Albert Hall alongside Sir Paul McCartney, Elton John and Eric Clapton.\n\nIn 2005 Midge undertook both extensive acoustic tours of Germany and the UK as well as performing with the long standing \"Night of the Proms\" in Germany. This 21 date sell out tour of arenas saw a massive production with full orchestra and also starred Roger Daltry and Manfred Mann\n\nHe then went on to be executive producer for the Band Aid 20 single working with the likes of Paul McCartney, Joss Stone and Fran Healey.\n\nMidge's services to both music and charity were finally recognised in the Birthday Honours list in 2005, when Midge was awarded a long overdue OBE. He also released his autobiography \"If I Was\" through Virgin books.\nHe's also received honorary doctorates from both Edinburgh and Dundee Universities, mainly in recognition for his work with Band Aid and Live 8. Midge actually managed to fit in a performance at the Edinburgh Live8 show in Murreyfield in July where he played with Eddie Izzard on piano! Surely a first!\n\nMidge had long held an ambition to record an album of cover versions of songs that influenced him. He managed to record his own version of No Regrets in 1982, but it was to take 25 years and a change of format from LP to CD before he would record a full set of his favourite songs.\n\nTEN was recorded in a log cabin in Eastern Canada during the long snow bound winter of 2007 - 2008 and was released again by German label Hypertension in September 2008.\nThe CD contains songs that influenced the teenage Ure when growing up in Glasgow in the 60s and 70s, so alongside the obvious (David Bowie) are the less obvious - The Carpenters...Lulu. These were the songs that had shaped him as a songwriter.\n\nApril 2009 saw the unthinkable happen - ULTRAVOX REFORMED and subsequently released a new album in 2012 and toured the UK and Europe culminating in the band being Special Guests of Simple Minds on their UK arena tour, ending at a sold out show at the O2 Arena, London.\n\nEven with huge amounts of Ultravox activity, Midge still continued to perform in his own right, including tours of Australia and the US in 2013. The US tour was recorded and released as \u201cLive in Chicago\u201d. He also recorded an updated audio version of his autobiography \u201cIf I Was\u201d and as someone who always enjoys pushing the boundaries of technology, this was released on flash drive in 2014. His radio work with Trevor Dann has also received a pat on the back with prestigious gold & silver New York Awards.\n\nFragile was released in 2014 and was a return to his progressive synth roots with soaring melodies and introspective lyrics. With collaborations by Schiller and Moby,was playlisted by Radio 2 for 3 consecutive weeks.\n\n2015, being the 20th anniversary of Breathe being completed, Midge decided to perform the album in it\u2019s entirety for the first time. Ably accompanied by the boys from The India Electric Company, who had caught Midge\u2019s attention at a show in 2013, the songs took on a new dimension and the show was a total success both with the critics and audiences throughout the UK and Europe. A live CD of the show was released by Oblivion/SPV.\n\nMidge enjoyed playing with Joe and Cole so much that it seemed a natural progression to continue the format into 2016 with the Something from Everything tour, that went to Europe, the Middle East, Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavia, Ireland as well as the UK.\n\n\"I really enjoyed playing Breathe in it's entirety and there were some surprising successes! Album, tracks that I didn't really expect people to be aware of became the stars of the show, and this started me thinking about revisiting some older material that I never envisaged playing again as well as a raft of hits. Then I decided it would be a fun idea to play something from every album I have recorded right from the Rich Kids, via Visage and Ultravox, to my latest solo album, Fragile\"\n\nBritain\u2019s Best Part Time Band was a series filmed and aired by the BBC during 2016, which Midge co-hosted with comedian Rhod Gilbert. He also started work on re-recording his classic hits rearranged for a live orchestra which is due to be released by BMG later this year.\n\nThe end of 2017, after completing a 36 date tour with his Band Electronica, saw Midge and Ty Unwin release \u201cOrchestrated\u201d through BMG, a collection of his material reimagined with anthemic, sweeping, filmscapes of sound that reached #5 on the Amazon UK chart. \u201cBreathe\u201d has been playlisted on BBC Radio 2 for 4 consequetive weeks.", "otherInfo": "Songs Questions and Answers"}, {"Address": "327 Lasuen St, Stanford, CA 94305", "Artist": "Kronos Quartet", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8624132.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.1722, 37.4215], "Date": "Wed Jan 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-15", "Genre": "Genres: Classical Crossover, Chamber Music, World Fusion, Experimental, Conceptual Art, Film Music", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Bing Concert Hall", "moreBioInfo": "For 45 years, San Francisco\u2019s Kronos Quartet has combined a spirit of fearless exploration with a commitment to continually reimagine the string quartet experience.

They debuted as Complicated Animals in 2015, with the release of their 6-song EP \u201cIn This Game\u201d. Written and recorded in a cabin in the woods in Michigan, \u201cIn This Game\u201d received rave reviews from blogs and journalists, and was called the \u201cbeginning of a new sound\u201d by PopMatters.\n\nComplicated Animals released their brand new single Show Me on 1/19/18. While creating their new track, Monica da Silva and Chad Alger were greatly inspired by their recent move to Los Angeles, the music of the 80s, a love for lush, dreamy pop songs, and all things David Lynch. The Brazilian American duo say that although their new track encompasses more of an electronic, synth-based feel, the lyrical subject matter was based on organic, human emotion.\n\n\u201cShow Me (that you want me) really struck me as an intense idea for a song,\u201d says vocalist da Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s scary how detached we humans have become. Technology is great, but we\u2019ve got to remember how important human interaction is, and not just go through the motions like zombies. For this song, Chad dug an old synthesizer we had out of the closet. We started stacking sounds and layering vocals. The production came together quickly, and virtually all of the sounds in the track were created using the same synth.\u201d\n\nMonica da Silva's song Back To His Girl is now featured in the movie Lady Bird. Complicated Animals\u2019 music has also been featured in The World Cup, on international compilations such as Putumayo World Music\u2019s Brazilian Beat, and Ibiza Beats, in the BBC One drama The Replacement, and is slated to appear in the upcoming Paramount Network series American Woman.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "336 St Mary St, Pleasanton, CA 94566", "Artist": "Michelle Lambert", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8758436.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.875877, 37.662708], "Date": "Wed Jan 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-15", "Genre": "Genres: Acoustic Folk Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Beer Baron Bar & Kitchen", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cMichelle Lambert is the kind of electric performer whose deep talent reveals itself in sly, knowing bursts.

Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "243 O'Farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Katy Marquardt", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9188128.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.408656, 37.786085], "Date": "Wed Jan 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-15", "Genre": "Genres: Cover Band, Rock, Rap, R&B, Country", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Johnny Foley's Irish House", "moreBioInfo": "Katy Marquardt is a piano entertainer based in Chicago, Illinois, but she has played all over the world and even at sea.

I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

They have become mainstays at a nearby Southern Californian institution, The Old Place, regularly performing for patrons at the ever-packed restaurant in the mountains. There, they caught the ear of the late bassist Rick Rosas (Neil Young, Joe Walsh), who became a mentor to the group.

Through the mayhem of tunes you could feel a certain Scandinavian groove, and in that moment the connection between these three fiddlers was clear. After meeting at T\u00f8nder Festival for three consecutive years, Fru Skagerrak finally saw the light of day in August 2014.The trio brings together the diverse traditions from each of their homelands, which surround the Skagerrak strait. Through a repertoire of traditional tunes, new compositions, and songs in their respective languages, they express their kinship and love of their shared heritage. The result is an explosion of the sounds that exist in Scandinavian music today.\n\n\n\nThe self-titled debut album was released in May 2016.\n\nFru Skagerrak is:\n\n~ Anna Lindblad (Sweden): Fiddle and 5 -stringed fiddle\n\n(also known from LYY (S), Folk All-in Band (SE))\n\n~ Elise Wessel Hildrum (Norway): Fiddle, recorder and song\n\n(also in Gudbrandsd\u00f8lenes Spelemannslag (NO))\n\n~ Maja Kj\u00e6r Jacobsen (Denmark): Fiddle and song\n\n(also known from the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois/Danish duo Maja & David).", "otherInfo": "*SVER\u2019s Epic Nordic Folk Fest"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, USA", "Artist": "Sver", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/194318.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Thu Jan 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Festival", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "*SVER\u2019s Epic Nordic Folk Fest"}, {"Address": "400 Eddy St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Tony Tixier", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8517205.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.414392, 37.78382], "Date": "Thu Jan 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-16", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Black Cat", "moreBioInfo": "Tony was born in 1986.

Whispers among friends at a show. The notion of musicians working together on a project is often suggested yet seldom realized. Chicago\u2019s M O N A K R was born from such a notion in the grey of Winter 2014. It is a collaboration featuring Saam Hagshenas and Jonathan Marks of Hey Champ, two time Grammy-nominated vocalist Matthew Santos, and Dan Brunelle of Gemini Club. Hagshenas had approached Santos for years about lending his voice to a Hey Champ production, but the timing and music was never right until 2014, when Hagshenas wrote \"Diamond\" after losing his uncle to cancer. Santos added his vocal flair to the track, and the result led the two to decide this project should live beyond a single song.

It is a collaboration featuring Saam Hagshenas and Jonathan Marks of Hey Champ, two time Grammy-nominated vocalist Matthew Santos, and Dan Brunelle of Gemini Club. Hagshenas had approached Santos for years about lending his voice to a Hey Champ production, but the timing and music was never right until 2014, when Hagshenas wrote \"Diamond\" after losing his uncle to cancer.

For Zoso, it\u2019s much more than just being a tribute. It\u2019s about touching a golden era in music. Zoso embodies Page, Plant, Bonham and Jones in their spirit, tightly-wound talent and authenticity.\n\nEach band member has been carefully selected to portray both the appearance and playing styles of their Led Zeppelin counterparts. In eighteen successful years of touring, they have perfected their art. As one of the longest tenured Zeppelin tributes, Zoso\u2019s 2400 live shows around the world have established them as the most traveled and successful band in the market.\n\nZoso\u2019s live shows are not about simply playing the right notes, they are about aura and feeling, harkening back to the unique atmosphere Led Zeppelin created. It\u2019s in the way they play: Each band member\u2019s mastery of authentic vintage instruments coupled with spot-on vocals, guitar, bass, drums, and keyboards, their compelling stage persona and distinct Led Zeppelin sound, with astounding visual imagery recreates the music, magic, and mystery of a Zeppelin concert. The impact is so powerful that band members constantly hear from young rockers that they were the catalyst behind turning them into new, die-hard Zeppelin fans.\n\nTheir passion, musical ability, showmanship and precise attention to detail earned them critical acclaim, name recognition and a loyal national following. The Los Angeles Times hailed the group as being \"head and shoulders above all other Zeppelin tributes,\" and the Chicago Sun-Times declared Zoso is \"the closest to the original of any tribute.\"\n\nIf you missed Led Zeppelin live in the 70's or are looking to relive the \"Hammer of the Gods\" phenomenon, you must experience what the St. Petersburg Times calls \"the most exacting of the Zeppelin tribute bands in existence.\"", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // All Ages // $19 Adv & $24 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "1419 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Latin Breeze", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433317, 37.782618], "Date": "Thu Jan 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-16", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Sheba Piano Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Latin Breeze at Sheba Piano Lounge: Don't let the hokey exterior fool you, this place offers a comfortable, even classy setting in the heart of the Fillmore.

An anchored mindset that has led this Texas country music rising star from a drifter\u2019s adolescence to the jeopardous game of the rodeo circuit to the punishing toil of the Texas oil fields, and on into the fickle arms of the music business. Some might argue whether it is having nine consecutive #1 hit singles in Texas under his belt that has garnered him staying power, or that he is killing it in the social media world with over 2 million views on YouTube and over 3 million streams globally on Spotify. Maybe it\u2019s his 3 venerated album releases, or maybe because he can not only bat a full house on a 200 plus dates a year touring average, but also rope in crowds on a first time performance in an unfamiliar town. While impressive, all those distinctions can come and go in the world of music. The reason for his staying power turns out to be quite a simple one. And that is because Josh Ward is country music blood to bone, and both Josh Ward and country music are simply not going to go away.\n\nJosh spent 2017 heavily touring off the strength of his previous album \u201cHolding Me Together.\u201d All six radio singles hit the #1 spot on the Texas Regional Radio Chart and Ward quickly found himself going from opening act to the headlining spot in a matter of months. But in the midst of his growing popularity, he gladly bent the knee to fellow country music artist and comrade Cody Johnson who introduced Ward to his West Coast audiences. Getting the chance to be endorsed by Cody Johnson and perform at sold out shows in brand new markets is the kind of opportunity music artists chomp at the bit to have. When Ward and his band returned to those areas a few months later all by their lonesome, he simply could not have guessed at the reception he would encounter. \u201cWhen we went back to the West Coast by ourselves, it was sold out shows. I was literally blown away.\u201d It was at that very point while far away from his familiar stomping grounds in Texas with new fans slapping him on the back that Ward knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that his music was catching on in a big way.\n\nThe culmination of his radio success and his victories out on the road can easily be attributed to the actual man behind the music. In life, sometimes a person gets dealt a lean hand and has to choose his family from strangers along the way, people who make a conscious choice to take you under their wing and help guide you through life. Ward considers himself a very lucky man despite some rough teenage years. The love and support of his extended family and his chosen family was the concrete foundation he built his life on, and his fans are a big part of that. It\u2019s why they are drawn to him through the speakers, because he is what he sings. It\u2019s why they are drawn to him from the stage, because he\u2019s an old friend who\u2019s come back to visit. He\u2019s the animated truth of all he stands for, a self-made family man who always has a welcome smile and an open spot in the family. To his loyal fans he feels he owes everything. \u201cWords can\u2019t describe the emotion that gets put into these runs and the work that we do. And these people pay their hard earned money to see it every night. Thank you. Every time I step on stage, you guys remind me that I have more than I deserve.\u201d And so his brand new album, so aptly named, is Ward\u2019s dedication to his growing family.\n\n\u201cMore Than I Deserve\u201d marks Ward\u2019s fourth full length album release and it will greet the fans on May 4, 2018. With the philosophy of \u201cdon\u2019t fix what isn\u2019t broken,\u201d Ward went right back into the Rosewood studios where he recorded all his previous releases and joined producer Greg Hunt once again behind the board to create the next dimension of Josh Ward country music. The new album is 11 tracks strong featuring the signature instrumentation from guys like John Carroll (Cory Morrow) on guitar, Nate Coon (Aaron Watson) on drums, Milo Deering (The Eagles) on acoustic guitar, steel, dobro, fiddle, viola and mandolin, and Terry McBride (McBride and The Ride) on backing vocals and also writer of three of the tracks. The album is classic Josh Ward style on every front with just a little more gusto and a little more miles on it. Full bodied and emotionally fragrant, every song jumps out kicking up the kind of country music nostalgia Ward is revered for. The first single \u201cAll About Lovin\u2019\u201d (written by Brice Long, Terry McBride and Chris Stapleton) tells you everything you need to know about this album, a sexy tonkafied driver of a song that guarantees you\u2019ll be lacing up your dancing shoes by the time you hit the chorus. \u201cHome Away From Home\u201d is country piled on top of more country, and is, as the song says, \u201ca two steppin\u2019 juke box heaven.\u201d While Ward has never been afraid to sing other people\u2019s songs due to his belief that a good song simply needs to be heard, his own savvy for the art just so happens to be represented on three of the most powerful tracks. \u201cA Cowboy Can\u201d is the true grit of this album and is what Ward says best describes himself. \u201cOne More Shot Of Whiskey\u201d is a sobering tale told with 90 proof conviction, and then there is \u201cMore Than I Deserved\u201d ringing out with its vulnerable steel and head hanging resolve. \u201cMore Than I Deserve\u201d is country music addiction in its purest form. Josh Ward did not reinvent the wheel here, but damn, it\u2019s polished surface sure rides smooth.\n\nJosh and his band will be seeing a lot more of the country this year hitting a lot of new places on his never ending tour. It\u2019s still hard for him to believe he has come this far and he doesn\u2019t take one mile of it for granted. \u201cI never thought I would be rolling down the road with one of the hottest bands in Texas playing shows across the United States. I\u2019m happy to be here.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1522 Francisco Blvd, Pacifica, CA 94044", "Artist": "John Rybak", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9732218.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.49051, 37.636718], "Date": "Thu Jan 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-16", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Americana", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Winters Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "John is an established professional musical performer and plays acoustic shows around the San Francisco area.

This vocal powerhouse aims to connect communities with her universal language of love, hope, and happiness. Her unique musical and lyrical blend -- Bay Area urban soul tinged with the influence of her indigenous Filipino roots --has captured the ears of music lovers around the world. Boasting a vocal range that might be bigger than her, Cruz emanates a classic and timeless feel. Two full-length albums (Feel\u2019osophy and Universoul Symphony) and an EP (Illuminate Love) have garnered numerous awards and nominations including two Bay Area Black Music Awards for \"Best CD/Recorded Performance\" and \"Bay Area Rising Star\" as well as Northern California Entertainers Music Award nominations for \"Female Neo Soul Artist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year.\u201d She has supported several established acts including: Kenny Lattimore, Miki Howard, Keke Wyatt, Bilal, and others. The songstress approaches her music unapologetically and freely, staying true to herself, while her stellar band \"Instrumentali-T\" provides a grown and sexy soundtrack for her vocal creations. They completed a 17-venue, 4 month \u201cSOULShine Tour\u201d around California in the summer of 2016. Most recently, she had a SOLD OUT dual CD release concert with R&B/Soul band Feelosophy at Yoshi's in Oakland on 8/22/17. Cruz continues to grow personally and musically, introducing a new chapter into her musical journey. Her newest single, \"Losing in Love\u201d is perhaps her most vulnerable composition to date. It is a prelude to the collection of raw emotions captured on her upcoming EP \u201cH3artifacts.\u201d Paired down to only a piano and vocals, the record conveys the ultimate form of musical vulnerability and fragility. Digging deep into a broken heart, the record explores themes of love, loss, pain, and hope. \u201cI wrote \u2018Losing in Love\u2019 during a very painful time in my life. I felt like my heart was breaking into a million pieces and I was losing everything all at once. I couldn't stop crying so I poured out all of my emotions and wrote a song. It was a cathartic release,\u201d shares Cruz. She is fearlessly exposed as she shares her personal journey of reclaiming self-love, perseverance, humility, resilience, and healing. With her continued success and loyal fan base, this new release will not disappoint.

Second line music is being played both nationally and internationally. Element Brass Band is the premier brass band in Sacramento, CA and one of the only authentic second line bands on the West Coast! The Element Brass Band has toured to New York, Atlanta and New Orleans. They have performed at many, many clubs including The Fillmore, The New Parish, Club Amnesia, the Boom Boom Room, Ace Of Spades, the Starlight Lounge, the Shady Lady Saloon. Element has opened for the likes of Giza (Wu-Tang Clan), Blackalicious, Andy Frasco, The California Honeydrops, Turkuaz, and many others.\n\n\n\nBackground on the band:\n\n\n\nWhen Sacramento trumpeter Ryan Robertson traveled to New Orleans in 2010, he knew that he had found a new home and calling. He was fascinated with the local music and immersed himself in New Orleans\u2019 rich culture. He quickly began working in several local brass bands. When Robertson returned to his hometown of Sacramento in 2011, he brought the music of New Orleans with him. He rallied some of Sacramento's top aspiring musicians, and the Element Brass Band was born! Robertson could not get New Orleans out of his blood and soon returned to the Crescent City to further his musical career, passing the bandleader torch to saxophonist Byron Colborn.\n\n\n\nA Brief History of Second Line:\n\n\n\nSecond line is a long standing tradition with brass band parades, born out of New Orleans. The tradition is rooted in post-Civil War America with musical ties and lineage dating back to early West African culture. The main line, also known as the first line, is the first section in a brass band parade. The first line is led by members of the respective club who hold a parading permit. In the first line of the parade you will also find the brass band. Those who follow behind the parade to dance and enjoy the music are known as the second line; this means YOU! Second line parades generally lack the slower hymns and solemn music of \"jazz funerals,\" also a common tradition in New Orleans. The second line style of traditional dance, known as \"second lining,\" includes exaggerated movements, loose coordination, and a freedom of interpretation. Brightly colored parasols and handkerchiefs being held high are common to brass band parades. Second line music represents freedom, history and the celebration of life itself!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1353 Bush St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Manos Lindas", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8640683.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419538, 37.788526], "Date": "Fri Jan 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-17", "Genre": "Genres: Math Rock, Instrumental, Progressive Alternative", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Music City Rehearsal", "moreBioInfo": "Manos Lindas is the product of what its name suggests.

On his debut solo album, Capsules, Hayfitz debunks the value of time, nurturing brief yet defining experiences into lush songs covered in vocals as delicate as they are determined.\n\nHayfitz has spent his career practicing exercises in ultimate vulnerability, diving deeper into writing to push his emotions further and break down the technicalities of song structure for richer soundscapes. His various shoestring travels throughout the world featuring life in a backpack have offered him merit to otherwise minute gestures from strangers and family alike.\n\nThe foundation of Capsules was recorded over eighteen days in a Seattle home surrounded by idyllic views of the Puget Sound and the region\u2019s mountains and evergreens. The setting brought Hayfitz the emotional space to deliver the record with resolve, bringing intentional details to each song and distilling the franticness of a Brooklyn lifestyle.\n\nCapsules took on its current shape in a secluded winter cabin in Parker, Pennsylvania where friend turned collaborator, Patrick Gregg, hosted Hayfitz for two separate week-long periods.\nEach inspired by contemporaries like Andy Shauf and Chad Vangaalen, Gregg and Hayfitz collaborated to bring a range of woodwinds to the recording process, with Gregg playing everything from bass clarinet to saxophone. Gregg\u2019s added aptitude in both modular and analog synthesis formed the underlying soundscapes that created a cohesive record, running Hayfitz\u2019s demo midi sequences through various vintage synthesizers.\n\nFrom there, collaboration became a key component to the album\u2019s finesse, with Hayfitz bringing ten friends and acquaintances into his DIY studio spaces over the six month process, each collaboration painting a new layer of impactful, unfiltered work.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "924 Gilman St, Berkeley, CA 94706", "Artist": "Ceschi", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9776179.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299296, 37.879505], "Date": "Fri Jan 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-17", "Genre": "Genres: Folk Rap, Hip Hop, Indie Rock, Punk, Folk, Underground Rap, Experimental", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "924 Gilman", "moreBioInfo": "Ceschi Ramos is a rapper and singer from Connecticut who has been hopping genres and spilling guts for the better part of two decades. He has been seen outside venues at 3am in Germany playing an acoustic guitar and singing to people that didn\u2019t want the show to end. He has written poems to fans from behind bars whilst locked up on bogus marijuana charges. He has suffered a spiral fracture of the humerus while arm wrestling a marine in Hawaii. He has recorded with and toured alongside some of independent rap music\u2019s most influential figures, including Sage Francis, Busdriver and Astronautalis. He has been in bands described as hardcore, crunk rap, lo-fi synth pop, Latin progressive and psych-jazz-rap. He has crafted abstracted and personal narratives mining the depths of depression and heights of hope. He has slept on countless floors when hotels weren\u2019t in the touring budget and lost girlfriends and jobs all for the love of creating and performing.\n\n\n\nCeschi was born with four fingers on his right hand, which served as partial inspiration for the name of his DIY record label, Fake Four, Inc. Those who have worked with him describe Ceschi as one of the most artist-friendly labelheads out there, a rare breed who values art over profit almost to a fault. Since 2008, he has curated a roster of wildly original and critically praised talent and put out albums from the likes of Open Mike Eagle, Buck 65, Sister Crayon and Dark Time Sunshine in addition to his solo records The One Man Band Broke Up and Broken Bone Ballads.\n\n\n\nAn engaging, theatrical live performer, Ceschi Ramos has treated entire venues like a stage, viewing the middle of the audience or an empty barstool as good a place as any to perform a soul-baring folk song or tongue-twisting rap track. Ceschi once described himself in song as \u201ca martyr at most\u2026 a failure at least\u201d and said that, \u201cIn the eyes of history I\u2019ll be no more than a leaf on a tree.\u201d He knows what it is to suffer for his art and is aware that music exploring the ugliness and sorrow of the human condition will always exist on the fringes of a game dominated by disposable escapism and expensive publicists.

Abandoned drinks rest on the lip of the dj booth while joints get sparked in the corners.\n\n\n\nThe tiny room is packed. Nobody quite knows how to describe the music yet. When Hooks and DC start their set the earth trembles. The air becomes charged and almost sexual. Everyone goes crazy. You feel the music in your bones. Your marrow shakes.

Critiquing, dissecting and swapping samples. They grow with every tune. They get on a level where their combined sound is unified and strong. MP releases an LP of hip hop instrumentals called Fresh Beets. It\u2019s a pivotal moment for the duo.\"\n\n\n\nFast forward a couple chapters.\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s 2009 and hip hop is in a coma. Hooks and DC are about to have an epiphany that will change everything. They thirst for something new. They want to make people move to their sounds and not just bob their heads, but to grind, heave, shiver, stomp, and dance to their music. They want to capture the ecstasy and comradery of house, the heart pummelling thrill of Drum and Bass, the beauty of ambient music, and the heaviness of electro - all in one sound.

He embarked upon a bold experiment called Thing a Week, in which he home-recorded and released a new song every week for an entire year, giving them all away for free. Even he thought he was crazy. But while a struggling music industry fell to pieces over filesharing and shifting business models, Jonathan Coulton quietly and independently amassed a small army of techies, nerds, and dedicated superfans who buy his music even though they don't have to.\n\n\n\nCoulton speaks to the outcast in all of us, in the voices of characters we know from our own sad little lives: the awkward, lovelorn mad scientist from \"Skullcrusher Mountain,\" the powerless wage slave from \"Code Monkey,\" and the annoying former coworker turned zombie from the anthemic ode to office doublespeak, \"Re: Your Brains.\" His songs resonate because he transcends what might otherwise be a gimmicky genre of songwriting - behind every misunderstood monster is a human frailty that we recognize all too well.\n\n\n\nLuckily for his patient and supportive family, his internet superstar status has led to much real world success. He tours extensively in the US, Canada, the UK, and Europe. His song \"Code Monkey\" was used as the theme for the G4 animated series \"Code Monkeys,\" and in 2007 he was tapped to write \"Still Alive,\" the closing song to the award-winning game Portal. That song won the Game Audio Network Guild's \"Best Original Vocal Pop Song\" award in 2008, and has been called the greatest video game ending song of all time. If you yourself can't sing it all the way through, chances are your children can. In 2011 he was asked back to write \"Want You Gone,\" the closing song for Portal's long-awaited and critically acclaimed sequel.\n\n\n\nArtificial Heart is Coulton's first album of new material since Thing a Week, and it features an actual kickass band made up of actual kickass musicians, the delicious high production values of a real recording studio, and the talents of guest vocalists and actual famous people Suzanne Vega, John Roderick of The Long Winters, and Sara Quin of Tegan and Sara. It springs from a brief run opening for They Might Be Giants that ended with member John Flansburgh offering to produce Coulton's next record - a collaboration that fans of both acts have been waiting for their entire lives, whether they know it or not.", "otherInfo": "Boxcar Theatre and SF Sketchfest present The Thrilling Adventure Hour: An Immersive Comedy Experience featuring Paget Brewster, Craig Cackowski, Jonathan Coulton, Jonathan Dinerstein, Marc Gagliardi, John Hodgman, Marc Evan Jackson, Hal Lublin, Joshua Malina, Busy Philipps, Autumn Reeser, Annie Savage, Paul F.

Armed with a large repertoire of tunes from the Dead's 150-song repertoire, the China Cats, like the Dead, do not repeat songs from one night to the next. Their repertoire spans the Dead's entire career including vintage gems such as \"St. Stephen\"; epic masterpieces like \"Terrapin Station,\" \"Help on the Way -> Slipknot\"; Bob Weir jam numbers like \"Let it Grow\" and \"Feel Like a Stranger\"; obscurities like \"Mission in the Rain\" and \"Brother Esau\", and latter-day nuggets such as \"Lazy River Road,\" \"Liberty\" and \"So Many Roads.\" Despite their various allegiances, China Cats is a full-fledged band, listening closely to one another as they share the happy tangle that defines Dead-style jams. They relish the use of familiar Dead motifs: bluegrassy phrasing on lines far outside the bluegrass idiom, group pauses with glimmering sustained notes, and overlapping scales that unfurled like maypole ribbons. ================================================== \"The China Cats are widely recognized as the top Dead tribute band in the state and for good reason.

More than that, balance has become the band\u2019s modus operandi, with the group consciously juggling the darker tones of heavy rock with lighthearted humor; synthesizing tastes of funk, jazz, bluegrass, electronica, and more within their complex improvisational compositions. During live shows, Dopapod is known for taking fans on a full-out journey, guiding attendees through periods of frenzied dance contrasted with moments of thoughtful contemplation.\n\nSince forming at Berklee College Of Music in 2007, Dopapod\u2014composed of Eli Winderman (keys and vocals), Rob Compa (guitar and vocals), Chuck Jones (bass), and Neal \u201cFro\u201d Evans (drums)\u2014has racked up an enviable list of accomplishments: a flourishing fanbase across the country, yearly show counts tallying into the hundreds, and high-profile appearances at festivals like Bonnaroo, Electric Forest, Summer Camp, High Sierra, and more. Most recently, in fall of 2017, the group released Megagem, the band\u2019s fifth studio album, which Glide Magazine called \u201csimultaneously their most focused and thematically ambitious affair to date.\u201d\n\nAfter a successful decade together, Dopapod went on a planned yearlong hiatus in 2018 with the goal of restoring balance to the band. Explained Eli Winderman, \u201cWe have a fresh perspective on the whole thing\u2014a different outlook on the band and on life. There\u2019s a lot of renewed energy we\u2019re feeling around it all.\u201d\n\nEnergetically, the space allowed each member to rekindle their passion for the project and bring their long-standing friendships with one another back to the forefront. With this time gifted to themselves, the group has also intentionally reflected on their music, working together to breathe new life into old songs and revitalize live performances.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to come back and play these songs together again, to see if they can take on a new life,\u201d Chuck Jones added. \u201cAfter this year off, we\u2019re not just going to be playing the same songs the same way we were five years ago.\u201d\n\nNow, with their yearlong hiatus winding to its end, Dopapod is preparing to make their triumphant return in 2019. On April 27th, the band will return to the stage, performing a special comeback show at Port Chester, New York\u2019s historic Capitol Theatre. Eager to show off the fruits of their hiatus, Dopapod is uniquely poised to celebrate the band\u2019s past accomplishments and highlight their newfound energy as they look to the future.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Railroad Earth", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7470184.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Fri Jan 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-17", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Americana, Bluegrass, Psychedelic Rock, Jam Bands", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore", "moreBioInfo": "There\u2019s a great scene in The Last Waltz \u2013 the documentary about The Band\u2019s final concert \u2013 where director Martin Scorsese is discussing music with drummer/singer/mandolin player Levon Helm. Helm says, \u201cIf it mixes with rhythm, and if it dances, then you\u2019ve got a great combination of all those different kinds of music: country, bluegrass, blues music, show music\u2026\u201d\n\nTo which Scorsese, the inquisitive interviewer, asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s it called, then?\u201d\n\u201cRock & roll!\u201d\n\nClearly looking for a more specific answer, but realizing that he isn\u2019t going to get one, Marty laughs. \u201cRock & roll\u2026\u201d\nWell, that\u2019s the way it is sometimes: musicians play music, and don\u2019t necessarily worry about where it gets filed. It\u2019s the writers, record labels, managers, etc., who tend to fret about what \u201ckind\u201d of music it is.\nAnd like The Band, the members of Railroad Earth aren\u2019t losing sleep about what \u201ckind\u201d of music they play \u2013 they just play it. When they started out in 2001, they were a bunch of guys interested in playing acoustic instruments together. As Railroad Earth violin/vocalist Tim Carbone recalls, \u201cAll of us had been playing in various projects for years, and many of us had played together in different projects. But this time, we found ourselves all available at the same time.\u201d\n\nSongwriter/lead vocalist Todd Sheaffer continues, \u201cWhen we started, we only loosely had the idea of getting together and playing some music. It started that informally; just getting together and doing some picking and playing. Over a couple of month period, we started working on some original songs, as well as playing some covers that we thought would be fun to play.\u201d Shortly thereafter, they took five songs from their budding repertoire into a studio and knocked out a demo in just two days. Their soon-to-be manager sent that demo to a few festivals, and \u2013 to the band\u2019s surprise \u2013 they were booked at the prestigious Telluride Bluegrass Festival before they\u2019d even played their first gig. This prompted them to quickly go in and record five more songs; the ten combined tracks of which made up their debut album, \u201cThe Black Bear Sessions.\u201d\n\nThat was the beginning of Railroad Earth\u2019s journey: since those early days, they\u2019ve gone on to release five more critically acclaimed studio albums and one hugely popular live one called, \u201cElko.\u201d They\u2019ve also amassed a huge and loyal fanbase who turn up to support them in every corner of the country, and often take advantage of the band\u2019s liberal taping and photo policy. But Railroad Earth bristle at the notion of being lumped into any one \u201cscene.\u201d Not out of animosity for any other artists: it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t find the labels very useful. As Carbone points out, \u201cWe use unique acoustic instrumentation, but we\u2019re definitely not a bluegrass or country band, which sometimes leaves music writers confused as to how to categorize us. We\u2019re essentially playing rock on acoustic instruments.\u201d\nUltimately, Railroad Earth\u2019s music is driven by the remarkable songs of front-man, Todd Sheaffer, and is delivered with seamless arrangements and superb musicianship courtesy of all six band members. As mandolin/bouzouki player John Skehan points out, \u201cOur M.O. has always been that we can improvise all day long, but we only do it in service to the song. There are a lot of songs that, when we play them live, we adhere to the arrangement from the record. And other songs, in the nature and the spirit of the song, everyone knows we can kind of take flight on them.\u201d Sheaffer continues: \u201cThe songs are our focus, our focal point; it all starts right there. Anything else just comments on the songs and gives them color. Some songs are more open than others. They \u2018want\u2019 to be approached that way \u2013 where we can explore and trade musical ideas and open them up to different territories. But sometimes it is what the song is about.\u201d\n\nSo: they can jam with the best of them and they have some bluegrass influences, but they use drums and amplifiers (somewhat taboo in the bluegrass world). What kind of music is it then? Mandolin/vocalist John Skehan offers this semi-descriptive term: \u201cI always describe it as a string band, but an amplified string band with drums.\u201d Tim Carbone takes a swing: \u201cWe\u2019re a Country & Eastern band! \u201d Todd Sheaffer offers \u201cA souped-up string band? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not good at this.\u201d Or, as a great drummer/singer/mandolin player with an appreciation for Americana once said: \u201cRock & roll!\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "SOUL SKA", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9555947.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Fri Jan 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-17", "Genre": "Genres: Ska, Ska Revival, Reggae, Soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room", "moreBioInfo": "Featuring members of Vinyl, Monophonics, Stymie and The Pimp Jones Luv Orchestra, The Right Time, Jethro Jeremiah Band, and El Radio Fantastique.

Take Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra\u2014 passing through tradition, the quartet stumbled upon innovation, proving that old souls can be creatively fresh.\n\nThe Santa Cruz, California-based quartet\u2019s latest, Stereoscope, out February 9, 2018, marks an evolutionary leap in a journey of artistic identity, songwriting maturity, band friendship and fiery group synergy. Here, Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra homed in on their signature cosmic roots aesthetic, brimming with cinematic songcraft, impressionistic lyrics, clever arrangements, telepathic ensemble interplay, and soulfully world-weary vocals. Imagine the delta blues reprised by psychedelic indie rockers.\n\n\u201cMy whole career has been based on better understanding what\u2019s real and important in artistry, and what is bull#$%,\u201d says Marty. \u201cWhen you weed out all the excess, the little thing that is left is you.\u201d\n\nMarty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra features Marty on electrified resonator guitar and vocals, Chris Lynch on violin and keys, Ben Berry on upright bass, and Matt Goff on drums and percussion. The group specializes in roots music with evocative lyrics that are conceptually cryptic, relying on imagery and symbols to convey emotion. Artistic touchstones for the group include John Lee Hooker, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, the darkly cathartic oeuvre of Tom Waits, and the experimental arrangements of Radiohead.\n\nIn its five-year existence, the band has released one previous full length, one EP, and toured nationally and internationally, selling out venues along the West Coast and throughout the United Kingdom. Select career live performance highlights include performing at Outsidelands Festival, Bottlerock, and the Maverick Festival, where despite being at the bottom of the bill, the group managed to sell more CDs than any other artist in the festival's history. They\u2019ve opened for such diverse artists as Shakey Graves, Deer Tick, Martin Sexton, and Kaki King. In addition, they\u2019ve been featured on NPR\u2019s Weekend Edition, and the band\u2019s beloved track, \"Cold Canary Gaslight,\" from its 2014 studio debut album, Pray for Rain, has currently surpassed passed one million Spotify listens.\nMarty\u2019s blues epiphany came from a somewhat hilarious turn of events when, as a teenager, he tried to download a hip hop track on Napster, but accidently downloaded Blind Willie Johnson\u2019s \u201cLet Your Light Shine On Me.\u201d It was indeed a fateful mistake. Marty saw an avenue of expression for his teen angst in the simple 3-chord structures and earthy melodies of the blues, and dove headfirst into the tradition.\n\n\u201cI was dealing with a lot of stuff emotionally at the time, and I would sit in my bedroom, play guitar, and listen to old blues for hours. My parents would leave food for me outside my door,\u201d Marty recalls, laughing. \u201cThere was something both angry and calming about that music that resonated with me. That music was my place to get away from all my troubles.\u201d\n\nLater, Marty\u2019s father, a voracious music lover, hipped him to John Fahey\u2019s The Yellow Princess (Vanguard Records, 1968), and that record illuminated the possibilities one could explore with roots music. \u201cI felt like that record had one foot in blues and American folk music, and one foot somewhere else,\u201d Marty explains. That John Fahey record\u2019s lesson would play a part in the evolution of the Old Soul Orchestra from reverent traditionalists to Americana adventurers, as evidenced by Stereoscope.\n\nThe album represents the maturation of artists shedding hero worship and embracing the creativity within. These new frontiers are characterized by a heartfelt purity in Marty\u2019s vocals, the tracks\u2019 unique and richly expressive chord structures and progressions, a shift in narrative perspectives to a more observational bend, and emotionally dynamic arrangements that are beautifully arresting, often beginning with sparse simplicity and then reaching lush and fully orchestrated climaxes with sensitive group interplay.\n\nThe 11-song album opens with \u201cFirmament,\u201d which eases in with delicately eerie ambience and sparse musical accompaniment, revealing all the soulful nuances and inflections in Marty\u2019s voice. The song soars forward with an impactful arrangement as the full band joins in with rich and varied musicality, including a dazzling drum and percussive break and a violin solo as brilliantly fractured as a cubist painting. The album\u2019s third track, the haunting \u201cGhost,\u201d is a swampy ambient blues that uses the phenomena of sleep paralysis as an intriguing metaphor for vulnerability. The standout album single \u201cOff and On Again\u201d offers sweet yearning for a d\u00e9tente after a lover\u2019s quarrel. Other album highlights include a rendition of Skip James\u2019 blues classic \u201cHard Time Killing Floor\u201d with chillingly beautiful new music to accompany the haunting traditional lyrics, and the three stirring, but challenging, instrumentally-driven songs that conclude the album and recall fringe jazz guitarist\u2019s Bill Frisell\u2019s evocations of dustbowl Americana with futuristic ambience.\n\nStereoscope is no doubt a milestone entry for Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra, offering forth the band\u2019s most assured and mature release to date. \u201cWe put our heart and soul into this album,\u201d shares Marty. \u201cIt\u2019s the album I\u2019ve always wanted to make\u2014one that ten years later I can still be proud of.

Whether he was playing raw, eye-popping blues, or penning the evergreen radio hit Fooled Around And Fell In Love, or touring the world for decades delivering his original, good-time countrified blues, Bishop has always inspired his fans with his rowdy guitar playing and witty, slice-of-life songs. Rolling Stone calls Bishop \u201ca legendary guitarist\u201d whose playing is \u201cimpeccable and spirited...a distinguished American player.\u201d\n\nLate in 2015, Elvin Bishop formed The Big Fun Trio, with Bishop on guitar and vocals, and his friends Bob Welsh on piano and guitar and Willy Jordan on caj\u00f3n (a hand-played Peruvian drumbox) and vocals. After playing just a handful of live dates, the group\u2019s instantly crowd-pleasing music and undeniable chemistry took the blues world by storm. With the release of their self-titled CD in 2017, media and fan response was immediate and overwhelming. DownBeat celebrated Bishop\u2019s \u201cverbal hijinks, outstanding guitar work and country boy friendliness.\u201d OffBeat said The Big Fun Trio was \u201cintricate, funky and uplifting,\u201d declaring them, \u201cconsistently great.\u201d With its top-shelf musicianship and front-porch vibe, the album earned a Grammy Award nomination, and won Blues Music Awards for Album Of The Year and Song Of The Year (for the title track) from The Blues Foundation.\n\nThe Big Fun Trio quickly discovered the more they played live, the more fun they had making music together. So a follow-up recording was an easy decision. The new album, Something Smells Funky \u2018Round Here, finds the group fearlessly laying it all on the line. According to Elvin, \u201cWith a trio there\u2019s no place to hide\u00ad\u2014you\u2019ve got to be pourin\u2019 everything you got right out front. You need to be totally into it all the time. It\u2019s really cool to see how people react to the goin\u2019-for-it feel of the music.\u201d\n\nThe album mixes rousing, new originals, reinventions of three Bishop classics and some unexpected, soul-shaking covers. Something Smells Funky \u2018Round Here was produced by Bishop and Steve Savage and recorded at Bishop\u2019s Hog Heaven Studio in Lagunitas, California. Bishop wrote or co-wrote five songs (including two by the entire trio). The potent title track\u2014a tongue-in-cheek State Of The Union address as only Elvin can deliver\u2014 kicks the album off with Bishop aiming his lyrical truths at those in power. The humorous but piercingly direct lyrics take aim at the current political scene while Bishop\u2019s deep blues guitar playing drives the point home.\n\nLookin\u2019 Good finds Bishop autobiographically gazing in the rearview mirror with sharp, wry lyrics accompanied by Welsh\u2019s perfect blues piano. Willy Jordan sings lead on four songs, including blistering reinventions of Jackie Wilson\u2019s Higher And Higher and Ann Peebles\u2019 I Can\u2019t Stand The Rain. Bob Welsh, whose guitar or piano playing highlight every song, pounds the ivories on his own Bob\u2019s Boogie. \u201cThis album fell together easily,\u201d says Bishop. \u201cEverything I visualized about the songs\u2014from Bob\u2019s playing to Willy\u2019s singing, came true. Bob and Willy are great musicians.\u201d\n\nAccording to San Francisco Bay native Jordan, who has decades of experience playing drums with artists including John Lee Hooker, Joe Louis Walker and Angela Strehli, playing in the Big Fun Trio is \u201ccrazy different. It\u2019s rootsy but also new. We all stayed simple to stay strong.\u201d Welsh, originally from Covington, Louisiana, has performed and toured with Bishop, Rusty Zinn, Charlie Musselwhite, Billy Boy Arnold, James Cotton and others. Welsh says he too loves playing in the Trio. \u201cPlaying this music is fun and fresh and new to us. It keeps us on our toes. We\u2019re always surprising each other. We have to be fearless.\u201d\n\nBorn in Glendale, CA on October 21, 1942, Bishop grew up on a farm in Iowa before relocating to Oklahoma when he was ten. He first got hooked on the blues listening to late night R&B radio as a teenager, and began collecting, listening to and absorbing blues music. Once Bishop realized that many of his favorite records were recorded in Chicago, he used his 1959 National Merit Scholarship as a way to get closer to his blues heroes by enrolling in the University of Chicago, whose campus was located near dozens of the South Side clubs.\n\nAfter Elvin crossed paths with harmonica player and fellow University of Chicago student Paul Butterfield, the two began sitting in together at South Side clubs, often jamming with Buddy Guy and Otis Rush. They first formed The Paul Butterfield Blues Band in 1963, adding Jerome Arnold on bass, Sam Lay on drums and later Mark Naftalin on keyboards. Prior to cutting their debut LP in 1965, Michael Bloomfield joined the group as second lead guitarist, creating a groundbreaking, all-star band. The self-titled The Paul Butterfield Blues Band introduced electric Chicago blues to the rock audience for the first time. With the release of East/West in 1966, the band\u2019s popularity hit an all-time high. Their straight Chicago blues sounds drifted further into progressive and experimental rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and\u2014with two world-class lead guitarists on board\u2014the band helped pave the way for groups featuring multiple virtuoso guitarists, like The Allman Brothers Band and Derek and the Dominos. The band, including Bishop, was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 2015.\n\nTowards the end of the 1960s, after recording three albums with The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin decided to move on, heading for the San Francisco area. He became a regular at the famed Fillmore Auditorium jam sessions, playing alongside Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, B.B. King and many others before embarking on a solo career. He recorded first for Fillmore Records, then Epic and then for Capricorn, where his career took off. He charted with Travelin\u2019 Shoes before scoring big in 1975 with Fooled Around And Fell In Love (the song reached number three on the pop charts and was prominently featured in the blockbuster film, Guardians Of The Galaxy).\n\nAfter a seven-year recording hiatus, Elvin returned to his blues roots in 1988, signing with Alligator and releasing five albums between 1988 and 2000. After a few releases on other labels, Bishop returned to Alligator with 2014\u2019s Can\u2019t Even Do Wrong Right, and once again turned the music-loving world on its head. Reviews poured in from NPR\u2019s Fresh Air, Rolling Stone, Living Blues, No Depression and many others. He appeared on TBS-Television\u2019s CONAN and performed numerous times on A Prairie Home Companion, most recently with The Big Fun Trio.\n\nWith Something Smells Funky \u2018Round Here, Elvin Bishop\u2019s Big Fun Trio are clearly having a very good time. Having spent almost three years performing, these three tremendously talented musicians continue to inspire each other to new heights.

In between tours, Sweeney was working on the songs that would make up the album Peace Meal from an apartment overlooking the Pacific Ocean as well as Faraway Sound in Brooklyn, NY. The goal was to make this record quickly, before questions on the meaning of it all could reach him. Then, on a fateful night in April 2018, just as the final mixes for the album were being completed, an astrological grip intercepted Sweeney\u2019s life when he awoke to find his infant daughter no longer breathing and the toughest of life\u2019s questions falling all around him.\nA \u201cpillar of San Francisco's garage-psych community\u201d (TheBayBridged), Luke Sweeney has been a working musician for over a decade, playing with a wide variety of cohorts such as Tim Cohen (Fresh & Onlys), Tyson Vogel (Two Gallants), and Healing Potpourri. His personal output has always sparked interest among the interesting - an artist\u2019s artist, so to speak - as he \u201cconfounds aural expectations and puts the knock on reverence\u2026 with time-worn allusions to psychedelia, bubblegum, glam, and mellow Seventies balladry\u201d (Austin Chronicle) and \u201ca kaleidoscopic whoosh of psych-pop, indie-folk, lo-fi soul and futuristic blues\u201d (Bend Bulletin). Now, while those muses are still very present in his approach, the arrival of Peace Meal feels like something of a rebirth. Perhaps the songs were the fruit of a communicative collaboration between this plane of existence and another; Sweeney says the lyrics to \u2018Great Wide Ocean\u2019, written on the studio floor long before his daughter Rishi was conceived, came to him as if sent from another realm.\nMeanwhile, breezy melodies and buoyant beats soundtrack what is musically Sweeney\u2019s most pop-oriented album to date: \"It is easy to hear why this album has a healing quality for Sweeney; Peace Meal digs deep and balances a strong introspective slant with melodies reaching out for listeners and inviting them into its musical world. It deserves consideration as his finest work yet\" (Too Much Love). Moving forward and getting back on the proverbial horse, Sweeney had these words to offer - \u201dWhen the wheel stops spinning and the gears fall apart, the consciousness of the artist comes alive and puts a beat back into our collective heart.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // All Ages // $13 Adv & $15 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "201 Franklin St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Ghost-Note", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8597667.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Fri Jan 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-17", "Genre": "Genres: Funk, Hip Hop, Jazz", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "SFJazz Center", "moreBioInfo": "Multi-Grammy Award winning artists Robert Sput Searight and Nate Werth take percussion out of the shadows and into the spotlight with their new project, Ghost-Note.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "Rojai", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Fri Jan 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-17", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ivy Room Presents"}, {"Address": "1001 B St, Hayward, CA 94541", "Artist": "Bigelow's Treehouse", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6959682.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.082413, 37.672754], "Date": "Fri Jan 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-17", "Genre": "Genres: Roots Rock, Americana, Funk, Classic Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bistro", "moreBioInfo": "Since it's incarnation in 2008, Bigelow's Treehouse has performed in all types of venues in every major city across California and has shared the stage with Bay Area legends such as Tia Carroll and Little Wolf & The Hellcats.\n\n\n\nBigelow's Treehouse is currently recording their debut album.\n\n\n\nEqually comfortable on a large stage or an intimate coffee house, Bigelow's Treehouse can power through an upbeat blues shuffle with the same ease with which it can lay down a slick Meters style funk groove.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Miniature Tigers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8729909.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Fri Jan 17 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-17", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Alternative", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "The sound is important but nothing is more important than the feeling of the sound.

Something with that feeling that could connect with people.\u201d That\u2019s how the band had started, after all: When he and founding member Rick Schaier (keys) connected over Myspace in the mid-\u201900s through their love of the same bands. After a few albums, they brought on Algernon Quashie (guitar) and Brandon Lee (bass) to complete the band. The resulting record, Cruel Runnings, is something halfway between nostalgia and the ecstatic now, an album that yearns for the recent past while staring open-hearted at what the present dares to bring. Songs about swimming pools remembered on sticky summer nights, lovers meeting at discotheques, streets where you used to live. Let\u2019s just try to be as much of us as possible, Brand decided during the recording process. In that, Miniature Tigers have written a record that\u2019s eminently relatable, passionate but not without a healthy sense of perspective. Recorded in Jamaica with producer Chris Zane (The Walkmen, Passion Pit) the album sounds as freeing as the process felt. \u201cThere was just a different energy there, a different energy in such a relaxing environment,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything came very naturally.\u201d That\u2019s fitting of a record where Brand wanted to capture the way a relationship\u2014and through that, life\u2014really felt. \u201cNot necessarily something that was good and got bad,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the ups and downs of it.\u201d 2016 TOUR + NEW ALBUM COMING THIS FALL", "otherInfo": "Miniature Tigers return to Popscene on 1.17.20!

Being known for genre bending and crowd pleasing, she has mastered the art of reading the crowd and adjusting her sound to fit the mood and setting of any party while always maintaining her musical integrity. Growing up listening to oldschool breakbeats, techno, and house music from DJ Dan and Mark Farina along with discovering classic rock, jazz, hip-hop, and funk music she learned how to incorporate all of these elements together to create some serious flavor. Her first gig was in 1998 at X.O.X. 2 at the infamous 2nd and Jackson in Oakland. In March 2008 Elz graduated Ex'pression College with a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Sound Arts and after graduation she spent the summer interning for DJ Shadow. She assisted in preparation for the launch of DJ Shadow Digital (The DJ Shadow Digital Store) and processed sound samples for the Dj Shadow digital store.\n\n\n\nIn 2009 Elz and Denise released their remix track \"Get Back into The Groove Again\" on Muzimo Records shortly followed by their orignal track \"All Night\" feat. Audio Angel, a remix of Sue Cho's \"Bad Girl\" and a remix of Denise and Dawn of Sound's \"Death by Mary Jane\" feat. Elise on Look Out Records. \u201cSoul Power\u201d and \"Useless\" produced by DJ Elz and performed by Elise were picked up by Chris Lum and David Harness for their label, Harlum Muziq in 2010. And a year later remixes were released by Master Kev and Tony Loreto, Stephen Rigmaiden, Rubien Mancias, Grand High Priest, and Reelsoul. In 2015 she studied Ableton at Sequence One in Oakland and also worked as a Music Curator and Audio Engineer at the DJ app, Crossfader. Be on the look out for her newest productions with lyrist Louis Hale from LA to be realease on Pet Food Records in the upcoming months. In addition to her solo gigs she has also joined forces with another Kazbah resident DJ, Lawson Terrell, as the duo Something Dope, which incorporates Ableton and live bass performance to create a truly unique live set. She has performed gigs in Tulum and Playa del Carmen in Mexico, Member's Only in New York, Coachella, WMC in Miami, L.A., Tahoe, Sunset Campout, Burning Man and all over the bay area including SF's 2nd Sunday, Mezzanine, Temple, Mighty, Monarch, DNA Lounge, Ruby Skye, The End Up, 1015 Folsom, The Clift Hotel, Audio SF and is currently a resident DJ with the Burning Man camp The Kazbah and monthly party Common Ground with Joey Alaniz.

Part alien, part mime, part priestess -- yet all summed up in the feeble form of a human looking body, Deb Demure aims to serve as a musical and visual medium marrying the void and the form.", "otherInfo": "The UC Theatre Presents: Home Sick Festival with Joyce Manor + more"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "All Your Sisters", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8053701.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Jan 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-18", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Post Punk", "Time": "5:40 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "ORDER AYS's 2nd LP \"Uncomfortable Skin\" now http://nowflensing.com http://allyoursistersmusic.bandcamp.com ORDER \"Uncomfortable Skin\" now http://nowflensing.com http://allyoursistersmusic.bandcamp.com https://soundcloud.com/allyoursisters", "otherInfo": "The UC Theatre Presents: Home Sick Festival with Joyce Manor + more"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "French Vanilla", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9089141.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Jan 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-18", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Post Punk", "Time": "5:40 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "French Vanilla is an art-punk band based in Los Angeles that regulates the dance floor with punchy bass lines, catchy sax hooks and socially engaged lyrics.

To some, Glitterer seeed to manifest the parallel identity, something between an alter-ego and a superego, of Ned Russin, who wrote, sang, and played every note of the EP\u2019s eight songs. Ned Russin is a New Yorker, by way of Northeastern Pennsylvania, a 29-year-old bassist and singer who made his name in music by playing in a band called Title Fight.\n\nGlitterer features spartan instrumentation \u2014 bass, drum machine, synths, and a familiar voice \u2014 and its compositional ethos, such as the listener can grasp, lies in hyper-efficient deployment of discrete harmonic and melodic ideas, also known as verses, choruses, and bridges. The introspective but gnomic lyrics address the kinds of ontological, existential, epistemological, ethical, and moral questions one would expect might occur to a 20-something liberal-arts college student (which Ned was, at Columbia, at the time of Glitterer\u2019s release) all while wryly acknowledging the predictability of such heady questions\u2019 arising under such heady conditions.\n\nNot Glitterer, a five-song follow-up, appeared eight months later. As is suggested by the antinomic title, the newer EP is even more preoccupied with contemplating the exigencies and implications of regarding oneself and of regarding oneself regarding oneself and, of course, of regarding oneself regarding oneself regarding oneself. And, as with the first record, no song extends a second beyond what\u2019s necessary to deliver the minimally viable aesthetic and intellectual goods. One would be hard-pressed to name an artist that conveyed a higher concentration of stimulation and aural pleasure in 2017 and 2018.\n\nAt this point in the story, Glitterer was all but bound to be forced into certain boxes. Here we had what appeared, at a casual glance, to be an erstwhile rock musician\u2019s inevitable solo-electro project, consisting as it did of cleverly written songs whose principal subject was the very self that had conceived them. And this at a time when the most talked-about independent musicians were radically self-involved \u201cSoundcloud rappers,\u201d a time whose zeitgeist, engineered in large part by Silicon Valley\u2019s oligarchs and their data-harvesting social networks, produced and nurtured the most narcissistic individuals in the most narcissistic moment in the history of the most narcissistic society in the history of the world. In this context, Glitterer must be a low- or no-stakes novelty exercise in recreational solipsism. Or else one disingenuous man\u2019s cynical bid for a slice of the post-Lil Peep streaming-revenue pie. Or else a bit of self-serious critical-theory cosplay meant to flatter the intellectual vanity of budding coastal elites. Or maybe a toxic mix of all three?\n\nBut anyone harbouring such suspicions was disabused of them as soon as they saw Glitterer play live during this period. Recordings are plastic objects (in more senses than one) onto which listeners project their biases: A musician who tries to convey vulnerability, earnestness, or self-effacement solely through records is at the mercy of those who would superimpose onto them their own cynicism. (This is, after all the most narcissistic moment in the history of the most narcissistic society in the history of the world.) Live performance is different: A musician who goes out of his way to commune in good faith with people who themselves have gone out of their way to stand together in a room \u2014 such a musician is not so easily dismissed. And so it was that, accompanied only by a microphone stand and a Mac laptop perched on a stool like a standup comic\u2019s glass of water, Ned performed 42 U.S. shows from 2017 to 2019, mostly opening for punk and hardcore bands. His dad called it his karaoke act.\n\nBut the live show, too, was a contingency, a temporary means to an end that, like the EP\u2019s, occluded an essential paradox: Glitterer is a solo project, Glitterer is Ned Russin \u2014 but Glitterer is, and has always been, a band.\n\nHence Looking Through The Shades, Glitterer\u2019s debut full-length album, out on Anti- in summer 2019. Recorded in the cozy carpeted basement of the Russin family home, in Kingston, Pa., and co-produced by indie-rock prodigy Alexander Giannascoli and the Arthur Rizk (Code Orange, Power Trip, Sumerlands, the 2018 Grammy Awards), the album not only contains Glitterer\u2019s best-yet sonics and songs; it has been constructed in such a way as to evince a spirit \u2014 co-operative, semi-schizophrenic, greater than the sum of its parts \u2014 that is proper to rock bands and that is inaccessible to even the least self-involved Soundcloud rappers and bedroom artists.\n\nSimply put, Looking Through The Shade is the sound of a group of people playing music, together, in a room. Now we have live drums (Ned\u2019s brother Ben does the honours) and dopamine-releasing fuzzy guitars (Ned\u2019s other brother Alex contributes a solo) to go with the synths, the bass, and the voice. Now we have a 14-song-long thematic arc, carefully sequenced. Meanwhile, the lyrics are still reluctantly but rigorously self-aware, the choruses are still habit-formingly catchy, and the arrangements still carry not an ounce of excess fat. From the saturated distortion of the opener, \u201cThe Race\u201d (\u201cI wish I could look at your life and know it\u2019s mine\u201d), through the road-weary \u201c1001\u201d (\u201cI sang 1,000 songs / Didn\u2019t want to sing again\u201d) and the vox-and-bass-only Side B outlier \u201cThe News\u201d (\u201cI used to be original\u201d), listeners are invited to join the album\u2019s team of creators in wrestling with the defining psychological and social conditions of our age. And thus we discover that Glitterer invokes solipsism not to glorify or revel in it but to understand and rise above it, and that Glitterer knows that no individual can accomplish such a task alone, which is why Glitterer is a rock band and always has been, even when only one person\u2019s name was attached to it.\n\nGlitterer was born in August 2017 and now, with Looking Through The Shades, Gitterer has come of age.", "otherInfo": "The UC Theatre Presents: Home Sick Festival with Joyce Manor + more"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Kim", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8884483.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Jan 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-18", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Electro House", "Time": "5:40 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The UC Theatre Presents: Home Sick Festival with Joyce Manor + more"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Full of Hell", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9056872.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Jan 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-18", "Genre": "Genres: Grindcore, Death Metal, Harsh Noise, Extreme Metal", "Time": "5:40 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "In certain circles, FULL OF HELL needs no introduction.

This acclaimed release was followed by a collaborative live tour, where the band bent expectations again in a whirlwind of electronic percussion and drone. 2017 was another prolific year for the band as they released their third proper full-length Trumpeting Ecstasy along with another collaboration with THE BODY entitled Ascending a Mountain of Heavy Light.

The gold-certified quintet\u2014Kellin Quinn [vocals, keyboards], Jack Fowler [lead guitar], Nick Martin [rhythm guitar], Justin Hills [bass], and Gabe Barham [drums]\u2014amplify the impact of their unpredictable fretwork, velvet vocal acrobatics, and hypnotically heavy alternative transmissions without compromise.\n\nIn essence, the band strips itself to the core and uncovers what it sought all along\u2026 \u201cWe needed to get back into a room and not care about the outcome,\u201d exclaims Kellin. \u201cWe needed to sit down and write something from our hearts we really love and believe in without regard for opinion. That\u2019s what we did. We didn\u2019t care about the result. We wrote one song, liked it, and moved on. Everything finally fell into place.\u201d\n\nThe time turned out to be right for them to do so.\n\nSince emerging in 2010, Sleeping With Sirens have tested the boundaries of rock by walking a tightrope between pop, punk, metal, hardcore, electronic, acoustic, and even a little R&B. This high-wire balancing act attracted a faithful fan base known as \u201cStrays,\u201d generated global album sales in excess of 1.5 million, ignited over half-a-billion streams, and achieved a trio of gold-selling singles: \u201cIf I\u2019m James Dean, You\u2019re Audrey Hepburn,\u201d \u201cIf You Can\u2019t Hang,\u201d and \u201cScene Two-Roger Rabbit.\u201d They launched two albums\u2014Feel and Madness\u2014into the Top 15 of the Billboard Top 200. Additionally, they collaborated with MGK on \u201cAlone\u201d and Pierce the Veil on the gold-certified \u201cKing For A Day.\u201d Beyond selling out shows worldwide and receiving acclaim from The New York Times, Alternative Press crowned them \u201cArtist of the Year\u201d at the Alternative Press Music Awards, proclaimed \u201cKick Me\u201d the 2015 \u201cSong of the Year\u201d, and featured them as cover stars a whopping seven times.\n\nHowever, everything came to a head during 2017. In the midst of the tour cycle for Gossip, Kellin found himself at rock bottom under a haze of depression and alcoholism. Reaching a fork in the road, the future of the band hung in the balance. \u201cI let everything go,\u201d he admits. \u201cI wasn\u2019t being the leader I had always been. For the last few years, I was struggling with alcoholism, depression, and anxiety. I didn\u2019t know how to turn it around or what to do. Being on the road and touring as much as we did for Gossip was really hard on me. I didn\u2019t know if I even had it in me to write another record or get on stage and perform. Something just happened one day. I woke up, called Jack, and said, \u2018Hey, I want to stop drinking. I want to go into a room and write the best record we\u2019ve ever written\u2019. Both of those things happened within a week.\u201d\n\nWith Kellin free from alcohol as of December 2018, he and Jack holed up at MDDN studio in Los Angeles and got to work. This time around, they welcomed longtime friends Zakk Cervini [blink-182] and Matt Good [Asking Alexandria] behind the board as producers. Jack cooked up \u201cdark music\u201d that immediately resonated with the frontman.\n\nThe whole process \u201cfelt organic,\u201d as he recalls. \u201cThe music reflected exactly where I was at.\u201d As a result, the first single and opener \u201cLeave It All Behind\u201d exudes an undeniable sense of urgency. A buoyant riff seesaws between electronic echoes before converging on a vocal crescendo topped off by a hard-hitting scream and distorted crash.\n\n\u201cSometimes, you get those thoughts,\u201d he sighs. \u201cYou wonder, \u2018What would happen if I wasn\u2019t here?\u2019 I put it into perspective. There are people who listen to my band. There\u2019s my family who rely on, love, and me. I realize it\u2019s important to stick around, because we can figure it out together. This is also a reminder for the youth to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up \u201cAgree to Disagree\u201d tempers a snaky bass line and a rush of vocals with a bold falsetto-punctuated declaration, \u201cI like the nighttime, better.\u201d \u201cWe can sit around and argue all day long, but it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s right or wrong,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe need to realize if we can\u2019t agree, let\u2019s find a way to coexist. We have to be open to understanding others, even if we\u2019re aren\u2019t one-hundred percent on the same page.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the equally anthemic and addictive \u201cMedicine\u201d confronts Kellin\u2019s demons head on as it details \u201cbeing up late at night drinking.\u201d The finale \u201cDying To Believe\u201d extracts comfort from darkness beneath cover of strings and guitars with a \u201cthank you\u201d for the fans and reminder \u201cto see the best in yourselves.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, the title, How It Feels To Be Lost, hints at actualization as much as it does potential.\n\n\u201cIt felt like we finally found what we were looking for with this record,\u201d Kellin smiles. \u201cThe lyrics, the emotion, the musicianship, and the production are all there. It\u2019s the best we could do. It\u2019s going to be exciting to get on stage and perform these songs. We finally found ourselves.\u201d\n\nIn finding themselves, Sleeping With Sirens emerge with their most dynamic and definitive body of work to date. \u201cCertain records have saved our lives,\u201d Kellin leaves off. \u201cThey became staples that I put on. They got me through hard times in my life if I needed to scream or sing my heart out or just feel thrashing guitars and loud music. This album brings all of those sides together. I want this to be our anthem for new fans. To the diehards, we want this to do justice for you.

This in turn led to the likes of Excision, Skrillex, 12th Planet and more. Having never heard the style of music before, Jesse was inspired to jump into the world of production. Learning the basics via tutorial videos, he quickly began designing and defining what would become his signature sound.\n\nSince his emergence on the bass music scene, Subtronics has released music on Never Say Die, NSD: Black Label, Disciple Round Table, SubCarbon, Deadbeats, Kannibalen, Dead Beats and more. He has collaborations with GRiZ, Space Jesus, Ganja White Night, SQUNTO, Boogie T, Rusko and others. Fusing his unique blend of cutting-edge sound design with hard-hitting dubstep & \u2018riddim,\u2019 along with a dose of \u201cspaced out wook trap vibe\u201d, Subtronics seeks to push the envelope and pin the needles in modern production.\n\nOn the live front, Subtronics has built a rabid following with his high energy sets showcasing his technical skills, chock full of chopping and double drops. Relentlessly perfecting his craft, Subtronics has toured North America and performed internationally, as well as gracing festival stages such as Bass Canyon, Camp Bisco, Lost Lands, Big Dub, Bass Canyon, Elements, and more.\n\nWhen not producing \u201cangry robot noises,\u201d you can find Subtronics at home in Philadelphia spinning poi, doing dabs and leading his devoted ever-growing band of followers in the Cyclops Army.

From there, the drive to experiment with new forms of production saw them splinter off from rap onto the fringes of the bass music scene. True to their roots, Pigeon Hole\u2019s sound leans heavily on nostalgic reference to their early hip hop influences; establishing themselves at the forefront of Canada\u2019s Bass music scene with their new approach to the genre.\n\nPigeon Hole (Lee Napthine and Colin McCue) got their start as members of west coast hip hop collective Sweatshop Union. Years on the road led into the summer of 2011, where the group toured the bass music festivals, and were exposed to a new array of genres and sounds. The decision was made to cut ties with Sweatshop Union and head back into the studio to redefine themselves excited by the many forms of electronic music they had been inspired by. The 2013 LP \u2018Chimp Blood\u2019, on Urbnet Records, was Pigeon Hole's first dip into electronica and played to their strengths as lyricists and performers. The albums anthemic singles, \u2018Champion\u2019 and \u2018Higher State\u2019, brought a refreshing voice to the rap world, and introduced a group in the infant stages of discovering it\u2019s new sound.\n\nRecently, a series of quality singles and EP\u2019s on home-base label Sleeveless Records saw Pigeon Hole pick up where they left off with their brand of broken hip hop bass tunes, and dabble in the newly coined \u2018Halftime\u2019 Drum & Bass sub-sect. The 2017 sticky-analog single \u2018Headnod\u2019 on Saturate Records, and the G-funk inspired \u20186 AM\u2019 on Gravitas, got international playlist support from DJ\u2019s and were rinsed throughout the summer. Pigeon Hole fuelled momentum by touring North American festivals, highlighted by prime time slot performances at Shambhala, SXSW, and Burning Man\u2019s Camp Questionmark Stage.\n\nPigeon Hole won\u2019t stop there. They begin the new year at the front of the pack in an emerging bass music landscape.

He has racked up four Grammy nominations, five ACM and CMT awards. Accolades like that \u2013 along with sales in the tens of millions \u2013 explain the respect Adkins has earned from both Country fans and the industry alike. But there\u2019s more. In recent years, Trace has made his mark as a TV and film actor, a voiceover artist, an author, a social commentator, a participant on NBC\u2019s Celebrity Apprentice \u2014 and even the inspiration for a series of comic books. Along the way, Trace has endured his share of well-publicized tribulations and the release of his latest album \u2013 Proud To Be Here \u2013 would be saddled with the same loss (and luck) that have shadowed Trace all his life. In June of 2011, as the finishing touches were being made to the upcoming album, the Nashville-area home Adkins shared with his wife and three of his five daughters was entirely destroyed by fire. True to form, Trace thought first of his family\u2019s safety, then steered the outpouring of fan\u2019s support toward the Red Cross\u2026then got back to work. Adkins\u2019 strength, focus and passion for fully-lived life infuse every bit of his new project. Proud To Be Here is the perfect distillation of Trace\u2019s art, displaying once again his ability to pour emotional truth into his music, whether it is of the tender or the rowdy variety. The project celebrates committed love in songs like \u201cMillion Dollar View,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s What You Get,\u201d and \u201cAlways Gonna Be That Way,\u201d the joys of the simple life in \u201cDays Like This\u201d and \u201cPoor Folks,\u201d the lighter side in \u201cIt\u2019s A Woman Thang\u201d and \u201cLove Buzz,\u201d and life\u2019s highest priorities in \u201cIt\u2019s Who You Know.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s so much on this record that\u2019s autobiographical,\u201d says the man with the soul-stirring baritone. \u201cI draw from the best writers in town, and time after time they capture things I\u2019ve experienced.\u201d The CD\u2019s title track is a case in point. \u201cChris Wallin, Aaron Barker and Ira Dean wrote that song for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been close to death several times in my life, and they know me well enough to know what I\u2019ve carried away from that.\u201d Perhaps nowhere, though, do life and art come together as poignantly as they do with the project\u2019s first single, \u201cJust Fishin\u2019.\u201d The ode to father-daughter togetherness captures Trace\u2019s own approach to fatherhood\u2014he taught his daughters to fish\u2014and the video, filmed at the family\u2019s farm, where the family moved after the fire, features his youngest, Trinity. \u201cI think the reason she was so comfortable in the video,\u201d he says, \u201cis because it\u2019s her place. It has been all her life. All of these people with the cameras and equipment were coming for a play day at her farm and that\u2019s the way we approached it.\u201d In addition to the ten songs on the regular CD, fans wanting more can purchase a 14-song deluxe edition including four more tracks\u2014two penned by Trace\u2014or a 16-song package including those four plus two live cuts available at Target stores. The additional songs include Trace\u2019s \u201cSemper Fi,\u201d dedicated to the Marine Corps, and \u201cIf I Was a Woman,\u201d a hilarious duet with buddy Blake Shelton, who teamed with Trace for the chart-topping \u201cHillbilly Bone.\u201d For all but the first single, which was produced by Michael Knox, Trace worked with co-producers Mark Wright and Kenny Beard. \u201cKenny was tireless in finding songs and in forcing me to put my nose to the grindstone, which resulted in me writing more than I would have otherwise,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd once we were in the studio, he\u2019s just so much fun to work with because he loves the process and it\u2019s contagious. This was the first time I got to work with Mark in the studio, and I really liked his level of participation. He\u2019s on the musicians\u2019 side of the glass, putting himself in the center of the room, and I think that helps cement a feeling of teamwork.\u201d The album is the latest in a career that continues to soar. With \u201cJust Fishin\u2019,\u201d Trace adds to a collection of hits that includes modern classics like \u201c(This Ain\u2019t) No Thinkin\u2019 Thing,\u201d \u201cThen They Do,\u201d \u201cHot Mama,\u201d \u201cSongs About Me,\u201d \u201cHonky Tonk Badonkadonk,\u201d \u201cLadies Love Country Boys\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re Gonna Miss This.\u201d It extends a journey that began in his hometown of Sarepta, Louisiana, and led through college football, the offshore oil fields of the Gulf of Mexico, the region\u2019s honky-tonks and finally to Nashville, where he was signed while playing in a small club in a working-class neighborhood. His stardom, which includes membership in the Grand Ole Opry, is of the multi-media variety. He has received the fan-voted Top Video of the Year award three times on GAC, \u201cHonky Tonk Badonkadonk\u201d was voted #2 Video of the Decade by CMT, and Trace has been voted \u201cCountry\u2019s Sexiest Man\u201d by the readers of Country Weekly. He has turned his entertainingly articulated views on a variety of current topics into a seat on any number of TV talk shows, and into a well-received book, A Personal Stand: Obervations and Opinions from a Freethinking Roughneck. He has narrated any number of TV documentaries and has been a commercial spokesman for products ranging from Kentucky Fried Chicken to BC Headache Powder. The comic book character he inspired, McBain, was featured in four well-received editions. Trace has appeared in many TV shows, including \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d and \u201cMy Name Is Earl,\u201d and in movies ranging from 2008\u2032s \u201cAn American Carol\u201d to 2011\u2032s \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer.\u201d He has performed often for military personnel, including two tours through the Middle East with the USO, which has given him its Merit Award. He has taken part in an \u201cExtreme Makeover: Home Edition\u201d episode that rebuilt a home for a Dallas SWAT team member badly injured in a shooting, and he has performed in honor of those who died on United Airlines\u2019 Flight 93 on 9/11. Trace raised three-quarters of a million dollars for the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network and is a spokesman for the Wounded Warrior Project. His charitable endeavors earned him the 2010 Artist Humanitarian Award from Country Radio Broadcasters. Still, he knows where he is planted. \u201cThere are times when my schedule can\u2019t accommodate both music and the rest of what I do,\u201d he says. \u201cWould I ever focus more on that and walk away from what brought me to the dance? No. I\u2019ve always chosen to stay with what I do best, and I think that\u2019s the smartest thing I can do.\u201d His ever-growing legion of fans would surely concur. \u2013Rob Simbeck New single, \"Still A Soldier,\" available today!

A choice of who you are, how you present yourself, and how you want to be remembered. And in the face of those daily choices \u2013 and ahead of the release of Upside Down \u2013 Set It Off has simply chosen to be more. More ambitious. More unified. More confident. More open-minded. More collaborative. And above all, more authentic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten stronger. We really have. As a whole. As a unit. We feel more together. When you go through struggle and you make it through, your bond strengthens. That\u2019s what Upside Down is about. That\u2019s the theme of this album. Going through struggle, and instead of taking it as defeat or a sign to give up \u2013 turning it into a positive and moving forward,\u201d declares Set It Off frontman Cody Carson. \u201cWe go through a lot every year, we\u2019re in the music industry, that\u2019s gonna happen. So we decided to band together, and just push forward.\u201d\n\nThe Tampa, FL-based band released Upside Down, their third full-length, on October 7th via Equal Vision Records. The album was recorded in Los Angeles, CA with producers Brandon Paddock (Panic! At The Disco, Avril Lavigne, Pentatonix), Erik Ron (Saosin, Panic! At The Disco) and Mike Green (5 Seconds of Summer, All Time Low, Cassadee Pope). The release was noted as one of the \u201cMost Anticipated Albums of 2016\u201d by Alternative Press Magazine and follows the band\u2019s sophomore album, Duality, which debuted at No. 18 on the Billboard Independent Chart, No. 81 on the Billboard Top Current Chart, and No. 86 on the Billboard Top 200 Chart; And the band\u2019s debut full-length, Cinematics, that was released in September 2012, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard South Atlantic Heatseekers Regional Chart, No. 4 on Billboard Heatseekers Chart, No. 9 on Billboard Next Big Sound Chart, No. 38 Independent Chart, and even broke into the Billboard Top 200 chart at No. 174. Set It Off formed in 2008 and is comprised of Cody Carson (vocals), Dan Clermont (guitar), Zach DeWall (guitar) and Maxx Danziger (drums).\n\nUpside Down sonically takes a brighter sound than previous releases and offers the band\u2019s most pop-driven anthems to date. Bold electronic elements guide loud, driving rock instrumentations with guitar riffs as catchy as the choruses and an overall feel-good, dance-worthy vibe throughout. On Upside Down, Set It Off commands attention and brings authenticity back to pop music in a bold and unapologetic way.\n\n\u201cI felt like a change was needed for Upside Down, so we decided to go back to our roots. Instead of focusing on what we think everyone else should hear from us or how they should perceive us, we went back to the roots of writing songs for the sake of wanting to write a good song. Opening our minds up to doing more co-writes and to collaborating more and just doing whatever it takes to chase that perfect song,\u201d he shares. \u201cAnd I feel like once we got out of our darker, more theatrical Cinematics era, writing became easier because we weren\u2019t inside of a box. So with Duality, the first time we started making the transition [to our roots], we started to open our minds to what Set It Off could become if we just didn\u2019t put any boundaries on ourselves and just wrote whatever came out of our minds and our hearts at that moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWriting Duality really showed me that a vibe is everything in writing. If I\u2019m excited and I\u2019m getting into it, then I\u2019m going to write better melodies. If I\u2019m feeling confident, I\u2019m going to write better melodies and have better ideas. I\u2019ve always heard that songwriting and producing is 99% confidence \u2013 and it\u2019s so true. Brandon [Paddock] brought out a writing side of us and a confidence that we\u2019ve never had. And I immediately became a better writer from that,\u201d notes Carson.\nDuality was our learning process of getting better and Upside Down is us \u2013 our system is on point now.\"\n\nDiscussing the band\u2019s hardships with people they\u2019ve worked with, how they\u2019ve coped with current events going on in the world, and reflecting on past personal relationships of past and present, Upside Down covers a wide spectrum lyrically \u2013 creating a dynamic and distinctly human experience. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s important to be honest, to be yourself. To me, I like how genuine the album is, I love the guys in my band because of the people they are and how real they are, and how real we are with everyone else. That\u2019s what I like with our connection with our fanbase too. And that\u2019s what I want people to take away from all of this...people just seeing us as people. That realness is what is most important to me.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Point North", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617342.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421386, 37.787858], "Date": "Sat Jan 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-18", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Regency Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "When all goes south, Point North\n\nFeatured in print issue 224 of Rocksound magazine; interview, album review for EP \"A Light In A Dark Place\" (8/10)\nhttp://www.rocksound.tv/reviews/read/point-north-a-light-in-a-dark-place", "otherInfo": "Sleeping With Sirens"}, {"Address": "540 Howard St 1st Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105", "Artist": "Throttle", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8290756.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.397236, 37.787955], "Date": "Sat Jan 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-18", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Dirty Disco", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Temple San Francisco - Private Event Venue", "moreBioInfo": "'Signs' w Niko The Kid out now! https://soundcloud.com/throttle/signs", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2395 Monument Blvd, Concord, CA 94520", "Artist": "Yaguaru", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.035618, 37.959908], "Date": "Sat Jan 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-18", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "El Billar de Concord", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Claremont, CA", "Artist": "Mike Silvestri Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7823917.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-117.7198, 34.0967], "Date": "Sat Jan 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-18", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Folk, Blues, Rock, Jazz, R&B, Country, Classic Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Walters", "moreBioInfo": "Work:\nHere\u2019s the most recent video of me in my studio doing a live vocal/acoustic cover\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1VWnlI38Xw\n\nHere's a demo of me singing and playing acoustic guitar live I did for an audition for a wedding which I was awarded!

He embarked upon a bold experiment called Thing a Week, in which he home-recorded and released a new song every week for an entire year, giving them all away for free. Even he thought he was crazy. But while a struggling music industry fell to pieces over filesharing and shifting business models, Jonathan Coulton quietly and independently amassed a small army of techies, nerds, and dedicated superfans who buy his music even though they don't have to.\n\n\n\nCoulton speaks to the outcast in all of us, in the voices of characters we know from our own sad little lives: the awkward, lovelorn mad scientist from \"Skullcrusher Mountain,\" the powerless wage slave from \"Code Monkey,\" and the annoying former coworker turned zombie from the anthemic ode to office doublespeak, \"Re: Your Brains.\" His songs resonate because he transcends what might otherwise be a gimmicky genre of songwriting - behind every misunderstood monster is a human frailty that we recognize all too well.\n\n\n\nLuckily for his patient and supportive family, his internet superstar status has led to much real world success. He tours extensively in the US, Canada, the UK, and Europe. His song \"Code Monkey\" was used as the theme for the G4 animated series \"Code Monkeys,\" and in 2007 he was tapped to write \"Still Alive,\" the closing song to the award-winning game Portal. That song won the Game Audio Network Guild's \"Best Original Vocal Pop Song\" award in 2008, and has been called the greatest video game ending song of all time. If you yourself can't sing it all the way through, chances are your children can. In 2011 he was asked back to write \"Want You Gone,\" the closing song for Portal's long-awaited and critically acclaimed sequel.\n\n\n\nArtificial Heart is Coulton's first album of new material since Thing a Week, and it features an actual kickass band made up of actual kickass musicians, the delicious high production values of a real recording studio, and the talents of guest vocalists and actual famous people Suzanne Vega, John Roderick of The Long Winters, and Sara Quin of Tegan and Sara. It springs from a brief run opening for They Might Be Giants that ended with member John Flansburgh offering to produce Coulton's next record - a collaboration that fans of both acts have been waiting for their entire lives, whether they know it or not.", "otherInfo": "TED Talks are influential videos from expert speakers on education, business, science, tech, and creativity.

Take Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra\u2014 passing through tradition, the quartet stumbled upon innovation, proving that old souls can be creatively fresh.\n\nThe Santa Cruz, California-based quartet\u2019s latest, Stereoscope, out February 9, 2018, marks an evolutionary leap in a journey of artistic identity, songwriting maturity, band friendship and fiery group synergy. Here, Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra homed in on their signature cosmic roots aesthetic, brimming with cinematic songcraft, impressionistic lyrics, clever arrangements, telepathic ensemble interplay, and soulfully world-weary vocals. Imagine the delta blues reprised by psychedelic indie rockers.\n\n\u201cMy whole career has been based on better understanding what\u2019s real and important in artistry, and what is bull#$%,\u201d says Marty. \u201cWhen you weed out all the excess, the little thing that is left is you.\u201d\n\nMarty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra features Marty on electrified resonator guitar and vocals, Chris Lynch on violin and keys, Ben Berry on upright bass, and Matt Goff on drums and percussion. The group specializes in roots music with evocative lyrics that are conceptually cryptic, relying on imagery and symbols to convey emotion. Artistic touchstones for the group include John Lee Hooker, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, the darkly cathartic oeuvre of Tom Waits, and the experimental arrangements of Radiohead.\n\nIn its five-year existence, the band has released one previous full length, one EP, and toured nationally and internationally, selling out venues along the West Coast and throughout the United Kingdom. Select career live performance highlights include performing at Outsidelands Festival, Bottlerock, and the Maverick Festival, where despite being at the bottom of the bill, the group managed to sell more CDs than any other artist in the festival's history. They\u2019ve opened for such diverse artists as Shakey Graves, Deer Tick, Martin Sexton, and Kaki King. In addition, they\u2019ve been featured on NPR\u2019s Weekend Edition, and the band\u2019s beloved track, \"Cold Canary Gaslight,\" from its 2014 studio debut album, Pray for Rain, has currently surpassed passed one million Spotify listens.\nMarty\u2019s blues epiphany came from a somewhat hilarious turn of events when, as a teenager, he tried to download a hip hop track on Napster, but accidently downloaded Blind Willie Johnson\u2019s \u201cLet Your Light Shine On Me.\u201d It was indeed a fateful mistake. Marty saw an avenue of expression for his teen angst in the simple 3-chord structures and earthy melodies of the blues, and dove headfirst into the tradition.\n\n\u201cI was dealing with a lot of stuff emotionally at the time, and I would sit in my bedroom, play guitar, and listen to old blues for hours. My parents would leave food for me outside my door,\u201d Marty recalls, laughing. \u201cThere was something both angry and calming about that music that resonated with me. That music was my place to get away from all my troubles.\u201d\n\nLater, Marty\u2019s father, a voracious music lover, hipped him to John Fahey\u2019s The Yellow Princess (Vanguard Records, 1968), and that record illuminated the possibilities one could explore with roots music. \u201cI felt like that record had one foot in blues and American folk music, and one foot somewhere else,\u201d Marty explains. That John Fahey record\u2019s lesson would play a part in the evolution of the Old Soul Orchestra from reverent traditionalists to Americana adventurers, as evidenced by Stereoscope.\n\nThe album represents the maturation of artists shedding hero worship and embracing the creativity within. These new frontiers are characterized by a heartfelt purity in Marty\u2019s vocals, the tracks\u2019 unique and richly expressive chord structures and progressions, a shift in narrative perspectives to a more observational bend, and emotionally dynamic arrangements that are beautifully arresting, often beginning with sparse simplicity and then reaching lush and fully orchestrated climaxes with sensitive group interplay.\n\nThe 11-song album opens with \u201cFirmament,\u201d which eases in with delicately eerie ambience and sparse musical accompaniment, revealing all the soulful nuances and inflections in Marty\u2019s voice. The song soars forward with an impactful arrangement as the full band joins in with rich and varied musicality, including a dazzling drum and percussive break and a violin solo as brilliantly fractured as a cubist painting. The album\u2019s third track, the haunting \u201cGhost,\u201d is a swampy ambient blues that uses the phenomena of sleep paralysis as an intriguing metaphor for vulnerability. The standout album single \u201cOff and On Again\u201d offers sweet yearning for a d\u00e9tente after a lover\u2019s quarrel. Other album highlights include a rendition of Skip James\u2019 blues classic \u201cHard Time Killing Floor\u201d with chillingly beautiful new music to accompany the haunting traditional lyrics, and the three stirring, but challenging, instrumentally-driven songs that conclude the album and recall fringe jazz guitarist\u2019s Bill Frisell\u2019s evocations of dustbowl Americana with futuristic ambience.\n\nStereoscope is no doubt a milestone entry for Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra, offering forth the band\u2019s most assured and mature release to date. \u201cWe put our heart and soul into this album,\u201d shares Marty. \u201cIt\u2019s the album I\u2019ve always wanted to make\u2014one that ten years later I can still be proud of. Making it has made me feel whole, and brought me a lot of joy.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "420 3rd St a, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Phil Griffiths", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9046383.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.27535, 37.79663], "Date": "Sat Jan 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-18", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Federation Brewing", "moreBioInfo": "Comedian", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3920 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Moss Eleven", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9209142.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4617, 37.78129], "Date": "Sat Jan 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-18", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Alternative, Hard Rock, Classic Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ireland's 32", "moreBioInfo": "Moss Eleven is the Bay Area\u2019s latest, and possibly best, alternative rock / pop cover band.

The sisters \u2013 two of six \u2013 had spent over eleven years making music together as Meg & Dia, and between 2004 and 2012, their emotive, soul-searching songs made their name in the indie and alternative rock scene. In that time period, they expanded to a five-piece, released four albums, and toured with the likes of Anberlin, Bayside, Saves The Day, The Plain White T's, Angels & Airwaves, Dashboard Confessional, New Found Glory and Sugarcult. They also completed three summers on the Vans Warped Tour and its short-lived, UK kind-of equivalent, Give It A Name.\n\nIn 2011, in an effort to promote that year\u2019s fourth independently released album, Cocoon, Dia appeared as a competitor on the first season of The Voice and finished as the runner-up. That led to a record deal as a solo artist and later that same year the first album under her own name was released, something which inadvertently drove a wedge between her and her sister. In 2012, under the name Dia Frampton, the band supported country star Blake Shelton on a US arena tour, but it was soon after that that they went their separate ways.\n\u201cMeg and I really split up on the last day of that tour,\u201d says Dia. \u201cShe just said \u2018I can\u2019t do this anymore\u2019 and I remember falling to the ground and balling my eyes out. After that, we didn\u2019t talk hardly at all and there was this weird tension for maybe eight years, where we\u2019d give each other a stiff hug at family gatherings and then gratefully turn our attention to our other sisters. But eventually we did go to therapy together, because even though we weren\u2019t getting along, we both wanted to get along.\u201d\n\nFast-forward to the start of 2019, and the sisters are not just preparing to head back out on Warped Tour this summer, but are gearing up to release Happysad. It\u2019s the album neither of them thought they\u2019d ever make, but it\u2019s one that not only finds their friendship rekindled, but their creative spark reignited and their musical horizons expanded. The unlikely reunion came about after Dia released her second solo album, Bruises, in 2017. She didn\u2019t not like it, but something about the experience felt off and she felt drawn to the musical past she\u2019d shared with Meg.\n\u201cThere was this thing that just started calling me,\u201d Dia explains. \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy playing alone. I put Bruises out and it wasn\u2019t hitting home with me. That album felt really, really lonely to me. It felt like me at the time, but it didn\u2019t feel like me as a whole. I was just really lonely in creating art because we\u2019d done it for so many years together. I called my younger sister Jade and said \u2018How\u2019s Meg doing? Do you think if I asked her to start up the band again she\u2019d say yes?\u2019 And she said \u2018I don\u2019t know, just ask her.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnbeknownst to Dia, Meg \u2013 a much more spiritual person than her sister \u2013 had also been feeling an urge to regroup with her sister and get the last incarnation of the band back together. In fact, she\u2019d been so determined to do so that she\u2019d been attempting to send telepathic messages to her sister and the universe in general.\n\u201cI had been toying with the idea of manifestation,\u201d explains Meg, \u201cand bringing about a reality with my mind. I was feeling discontentment in my job as well as the desire to be creative and have a deeper connection with Dia. So I started visualizing us playing together again for a week, and on the eighth day she called me and asked! And it\u2019s a big commitment \u2013 it wasn\u2019t asking me if I wanted to make a casserole, it was asking if I want to change the direction of my career. And there wasn\u2019t even a hesitation. I was so ready to jump on board.\u201d\n\nWith the last incarnation of the band \u2013 bassist Jonathan Snyder and guitarist Carlo Gimenez, Meg & Dia began writing new songs together, but not before Meg ventured off to South America to do ayahuasca and then went on a silent spiritual retreat \u2013 two things that changed everything for her.\n\n\u201cI did these things,\u201d she says, \u201cand it kind of broke me open right before we started writing the record. I\u2019d done mushrooms and acid each one time before and I thought it would be like that, but it was like this alien plant that you consume and then you literally feel like you\u2019re in a different galaxy. When I got back home, I kept saying \u2018I want a normal life and a normal job\u2019 because that experience was so crazy, but it shook up my world a little bit and I made some changes in my life. I ended a 10-year relationship, I changed my focus to music and emotionally I\u2019ve just been different. I fell into this super dark place, but in the midst of that it made me really open and sensitive, but also really needing to connect to the people that I loved.\u201d\n\nWhile she was in that dark place, Meg says became incredibly close to Dia again, which allowed her to become rebalanced and start writing again. The result is an album that, in keeping with its title, treads the line between joy and melancholy, darkness and light. Opener \u201cAmerican Guru\u201d \u2013 a song inspired by Meg\u2019s spiritual quest to find the truth in life \u2013 is a soothing pulse of dreamy electronics that\u2019s riddled with existential questions even as it realizes the answers are out of reach. The songs electronic flourishes are not a one-off, but demonstrative of Meg & Dia\u2019s new sound. \u201cLit Match\u201d, for example, is propelled by a slick yet soulful pop groove, while the tender innocence of \u201cTeenagers\u201d is offset by a dark undercurrent and \u201cKoala\u201d makes no bones about being \u201ca fucking mess\u201d \u2013 even if the melody could easily get a whole club full of bodies swaying together.\n\n\nWhile in the past, Meg and Dia would take turns to write individual songs on albums, their efforts on Happysad were much more collaborative.\nIt means these 10 songs are a blend of Meg and Dia\u2019s two distinct yet compatible personalities, songs which show how in tune they are with each other but also how different they both are. At its core, however, is a fragility and vulnerability shared by both of them, but which they hope can help others who may feel similar. Dia, in particular, is adamant she wants this record to not hide any truth \u2013 including the fact that, despite her success with The Voice and the fact she works regularly with other songwriters, she also still works as a waitress in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\u201cI feel that when people come back, it\u2019s often bigger and stronger than ever before,\u201d says Dia. \u201cBut I feel like Meg and I are coming back and honestly, we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re scared and nervous and we have the same fears that many people have - fear of failure, of not being enough \u2013 but we\u2019re still coming back.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re coming back stronger and bigger than ever with all our shit together. I feel like we\u2019re coming back older and hopefully wiser. There\u2019s so much security in being young and in youth \u2013 if things don\u2019t work, you\u2019re 21. Who cares? You can start again. But if things don\u2019t work out, we're in our thirties now and I\u2019m a waitress in LA and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to be doing. So there\u2019s a lot of fear in coming back, but I think the biggest thing that Meg and I wanted to translate is not to skip over our fears, but tell people that we have them and we\u2019re still doing this. Everybody\u2019s scared of doing something and if we can represent anything for anyone, we want it to be that we\u2019re not perfect, we don\u2019t have all our shit together, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, we\u2019re just as insecure and nervous as anybody, but the fear of not even trying is more terrifying. And luckily we have each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of my biggest fears,\u201d adds Meg, \u201cis not knowing if I\u2019m headed in the right direction. That brings me a lot of anxiety. But this is a time for exploration and stepping up to the plate and feeding into those insecurities and fears and exploring what the world has to offer. Writing a record with Dia, and even just being around her, has really opened my eyes. She\u2019s so open and not afraid to put her truth on the table and be vulnerable, whereas I feel like I\u2019m still covering up pieces I don\u2019t want people to know and that I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s okay to share. And that\u2019s kind of how the process of writing the record went. The songs would get really dark and sad and I\u2019d say things like let\u2019s claw it back a bit and not quite go there all the way and let\u2019s not be such an open book and she would always say \u2018No! Let\u2019s just tell the truth!\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition to being so open about those fears and vulnerabilities, Dia hopes this record can also serve to embrace the sisters\u2019 roots and become a kind of beacon for other Asian-American voices. That\u2019s something they\u2019ve never done before but which Dia feels, while they\u2019re being so honest about everything else, is just as important.\n\u201cGrowing up in a small town in Utah, we learned to try our best to hide our differences. I wanted to fit in. I wanted to be like people around me. I think Meg and I were seriously the only Korean-American girls in our school. And Asian Americans today are still highly underrepresented and when we are represented, it's often in poor taste.

Their energy-filled stage presence is heavily influenced by metal and punk rock. Hemorage does not conform to one sound and at the same time maintains their described sound. Many who attend a Hemorage show say that they would have an intense and fun time.\n\n\n\nHemorage began their band playing covers at a batting cage room in high school. After a number of created songs, they began gaining recognition in 2010 when playing at a venue called Thee Parkside. On the same year, Hemorage\u2019s fan base began to grow more playing frequent shows at the Submission (once name the Balazo). Since then, there is an increasing audience throughout the Bay Area and various places around the world for Hemorage.\n\n\n\nAs a member of Hemorage, it is important to stand up for what makes you truly happy and to go hard at it. The band has a strong Do-It-Yourself philosophy. They are also about the philosophy of by the people for the people. From Joey Voodoo\u2019s interview, Hemorage creates their merchandise from their own hands independently. When it comes to putting themselves out there, they will do their hardest to promote themselves by putting flyers everywhere, handing out flyers at events, talking with the people at the shows.\n\n\n\nWe, Hemorage, don\u2019t call our fans a fan; we call them friends no matter who they are.

Their music is a product of their cross-culture life experiences and a common story among immigrants in search of, and in pursuit of the American Dream. The talented trio originally from Iramuco, Mexico arrived into the urban allay ways of Chicago, later relocating into the industrial landscapes of Milwaukee after the release of their debut album, \"Del Norte al Sur\" (From the North to The South). The pioneering success of the album captivated a corner stone into the market place for Kinto Sol, as they secured the endless recognition into the industry's completive edge. Their instant fans quickly found refuge in the hypnotic content and memorizing lyrics. The motivation behind the band's music cultivated the demand to produce and release two back to back Gold albums, \"Hecho en Mexico\" (Made in Mexico) and \"La Sangre Nunca Muere\" (The blood line never Dies). Kinto Sol dedicated these albums to the fidelity of family and sheer perseverance against economical struggle, encouraging the pride in their cultured heritage. With each release, Kinto Sol continued to win the hearts and minds of its listeners, building an ongoing diversity of an audience. After the montage and sheer number of loyal listeners, Universal Records could no longer ignore the draw of the band's industry success, offering the band an invitation to join their seasoned label. Shortly after uniting with Universal, \"Los hijos del Maiz\", the bands forth hit album was released. The album documents and confronts the contemporary challenges faced by immigrant audiences, including unfamiliarity, economical discrimination and racism. Within a year, the 2008 Latin Billboard music awards nominates and awards the band with the Best Rap/Hip Hop category. In 2010, Kinto Sol again receives another nomination by the Billboard giants for their album, \"Carsel de Suenos\" (Prison of Dreams), In the best Latin Rhythm Album artist of the year, Duo or group Category. In addition to their independent success, Kinto Sol continues to credit their \"Soldados\", (fans) to the success of the band's acolytes without syndication and or absolutely NO radio play.

They continued their style of straight ahead guitar driven rock n' roll but this time with a more 60's rather than 50's influence. A few singles on United Artists, recorded at the legendary Rockfield Studios in Wales with Dave Edmunds producing, followed in the early '70s. In '76 they signed to Sire Records, who released three true gems of power pop: \u201cShake Some Action\u201d, \u201cFlamin' Groovies Now\u201d, and \u201cJumpin' In The Night\u201d.\nAnother lineup change ensued in the next decade with Wilson moving to England and joining the Barracudas. The Groovies continued on thru the 80's and into the early '90s touring Australia and Europe, putting out a fine but overlooked album called Rock Juice and then finally calling it quits. Jordan formed a new band called Magic Christian while Wilson released solo albums in Europe.\nNow in 2017, Jordan, Wilson led quartet have gone back into the studio to cut an album of brand new material. Having toured the world for the past five years, fans have been delighted with what is being called \"a dream set list\", including original songs the band has never performed before onstage. Newcomers are asking, \"Why haven't I ever heard of this group?\" It's hard to say just why the group hasn't gotten the attention they deserve (at least in the USA) but they're back to give everyone another chance at hearing and seeing just why those in the know consider them one of the greatest rock n' roll bands ever.", "otherInfo": "FLAMIN' GROOVIES performing \"Shake Some Action\""}, {"Address": "561 1st St, Brentwood, CA 94513", "Artist": "JB Duff", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9214941.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.693812, 37.931203], "Date": "Sat Jan 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-18", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Jazz, Blues, Swing, Celtic, Musical Theater, Americana, Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Mannheim Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "Drums, percussion, teaching, arranging - that's what I do!

His songs are scribbled, not written, on lipstick and sweat stained motel bedsheets because he likes the way the ink bleeds. His guitar runs on diesel and leaks like the morning after too much Whiskey. His is a show you'll probably want to tattoo on your body so everyone will know that you knew him before he was cool. His backing band, The Untraditional, are descended from Norse Warriors known as The Berserkers. Old Norse literature and historians note that Berserkers fought with an uncontrollable, trance-like fury. They would work themselves into a rage before battle, consuming drugged foods, and dressed in nothing but their enemies blood. The Untraditional follow their ancestors ancient practices before every show. Little is known about the night he was conceived because, frankly it is nobodies damn business. However, there are at least two people who had the foresight to procreate at just the right moment, when all of those dimly lit specs of light in the sky held a position just long enough to time stamp a genetic code and shoot it down from the cold, empty heavens to create another poor soul, destined to live and die out here on this cold rock, twirling violently in the vast emptiness of space. Then he was born. He should have been born at the top of a mountain during a lightning storm. Where he actually was born was incredibly un-exciting so let's all pretend that he was born on the top of a mountain during a lightning storm. It is good to start your life story with an epic moment, even if it is entirely fabricated. He began to write music at the age of 14. He still has every scrap of paper he scribbled his terrible lyrics on and on occasion can even recall the infantile melodies and riffs that accompanied them. The release of his first album in 2009, HELLA SOLO, was an amalgamation of many of the songs that he wrote and recorded in his room from the ages of 19 to 25. Most songs were recorded late in the night. Most times there was alcohol involved. What came of those 19 lonely, depressing songs became the jumpstart to THE SAM CHASE and the many live shows that followed. In 2010, he came out with his second album, TESTICULAR FORTITUDE, which was more of the same. They were songs that sat rotting on his hard drive that probably shouldn't have ever seen the light of day, or the soft underbelly of a burnable compact disc. In 2012, came the release of his long awaited first studio album, THE SAM CHASE WILL LEAD US TO VICTORY and needless to say, it totally ruled. Not more than 1 year later, THE SAM CHASE WILL NEVER DIE was unleashed on the unsuspecting public and pandemonium broke loose. Since then the band has played many amazing shows, including a few tours to far a way places. In their trusty Dodge Van named Big Russ they conquered SXSW in 2013, the Kate Wolf Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, Outside Lands, and so many others. The band also won some local awards for their music. In may of 2013 they won \"Best Band\" in the SF Weekly's Best Of the Bay Readers Poll and then again in October won Best Singer Songwriter in the San Francisco Bay Guardians Best Of the Bay issue. 2015 has been good to this band. A new album is on the way, festivals aplenty, and some new members to breath new life into a tired old musician. What's next? Stay tuned. San Francisco-based folk rock 'n roll.

Analog gives way to digital, trends come and go, yet NYC\u2019s DJ Joeski remains at the top of his game, and now, in the midst of his third decade as one of house music\u2019s most sought-after stars, his momentum shows no signs of slowing.\n\nJoeski\u2019s trajectory can be traced back to 1991, when he burst onto the NYC house music scene as a founding member of The Chocolate Factory DJ collective. He delighted crowds at Limelight, Tunnel, Palladium and NASA, helped turn \u201cSave The Robots\u201d into a NYC afterhours institution and earned his first residency at \u201cTogether\u201d parties at the legendary Roxy, playing alongside the likes of Danny Tenaglia, Louie Vega and Roger Sanchez.\n\nAlready a fixture on the U.S. and Canadian club circuit,in the late 90\u2019s Joeski added production to his repetoire, building his own recording studio and spending the next few years mastering his craft. In 2000 he burst into the clubs and onto the charts with hit after hit on Electrik Soul, Siesta, Chez and Camouflage, emerging as one of the most sought-after DJs, remixers and producers in the scene.\n\nIn 2001 Joeski launched Maya Records, with releases like \u201cHustler\u2019s Revenge\u201d and his collaboration with DJ Chus on \u201cEl Amor\u201d propelling the label onto the forefront of the U.S. house music sound that would become a global phenomenon and win him worldwide acclaim from clubbers and fellow DJs alike.\n\nDemand for his studio skills grew exponentially over the next decade, with Joeski producing and remixing for the likes of NRK, Ministry of Sound, Defected, Bedrock, Nervous, Cajual and KMS ,helping catapult him further into the ranks of the house music elite.\n\nEntering its 16th year, his Maya label continues a steady output of quality material that remain fixtures on the Beatport and Traxsource tech and deep house charts, with a robust release schedule that shows no signs of slowing any time soon.\n\nJanuary 2017 began with Joeski once again hard at work in the studio, teaming up with Harry Romero (as HR+Ski) on \u201cDem Tings\u201d for Maya, working solo on \u201cLessons in Dub\u201d for Poker Flat and also releasing the 14th installment in his \u201cMaya Sessions\u201d podcast on Pioneer DJ Radio.\n\nThe new music and remixes continued with the release of \u201cMind Function\u201d on Maya and \u201cTribute to Obatala\u201d on Crosstown Rebels, dropped by Pete Tong on his BBC Radio 1 show in February.\n\nJoeski\u2019s touring schedule continues to be as prolific as his studio output, headlining clubs from Acapulco to Helsinki plus a booked-out week spent at Miami Music Week 2017. In March all three tracks from \u201cTribute to Obatala\u201d simultaneously climbed onto Beatport\u2019s Tech House Top 100, with Joeski ending the month as featured artist on John Digweed\u2019s \u201cTransitions\u201d podcast.\n\nNew music continued to flow in April including the release of Dancing in Space\u201d on Kinetika and \u201cDeep Elements EP\u201d on Kitball, while \u201cMind Function\u201d on Maya climbed into the Traxsource Tech House Top-10. Returning home from a tour of Mexico Joeski hit the studio once again, jamming with SF\u2019s legendary Doc Martin on an upcoming collaboration and putting the finishing touches on his next solo Maya release.\n\nThis summer Joeski will once again be a fixture on the global tour circuit with performances at both Do Not Sleep and Dennis Ferrer\u2019s Misfits Party in Ibiza, extensive tours of Australia, New Zealand, South America and Europe while back stateside he and Harry Romero continue their monthly Yage night at Brooklyn\u2019s Output.\n\nFueled by his genuine love of the music, there\u2019s no doubt that Joeski will continue to evolve both behind the decks and in the studio, captivating new generations of club-goers and maintaining his place as one of dance music\u2019s most enduring talents.", "otherInfo": "SET with a Huge All Star #DIRTYBIRD line up at Public WorksMAIN ROOM: PEZZNER, JOESKI & BLACK V NECKTHE LOFT: With Local Birdies Late Eighties, Foolie, n808 & WillaaGET ON THE GUEST LIST: https://db-publicworks.eventbrite.com$10 before 11pm with RsvpSATURDAY, JANUARY 18TH21+ 10pm - 4am-------------21+ | No Refunds | ATMs on siteSound by Funktion-One (Official)Stay connected: publicsf.com/connectTicket transfers: bigneon.comPublic Works 161 Erie Street | SF, CA 94103"}, {"Address": "222 Hyde St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Mike Falzone", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9022657.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.415493, 37.782989], "Date": "Sat Jan 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-18", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Setup", "moreBioInfo": "Mike Falzone has been solving the internet\u2019s problems since 2006 when he became one of the first creators to establish themselves on YouTube.

He embarked upon a bold experiment called Thing a Week, in which he home-recorded and released a new song every week for an entire year, giving them all away for free. Even he thought he was crazy. But while a struggling music industry fell to pieces over filesharing and shifting business models, Jonathan Coulton quietly and independently amassed a small army of techies, nerds, and dedicated superfans who buy his music even though they don't have to.\n\n\n\nCoulton speaks to the outcast in all of us, in the voices of characters we know from our own sad little lives: the awkward, lovelorn mad scientist from \"Skullcrusher Mountain,\" the powerless wage slave from \"Code Monkey,\" and the annoying former coworker turned zombie from the anthemic ode to office doublespeak, \"Re: Your Brains.\" His songs resonate because he transcends what might otherwise be a gimmicky genre of songwriting - behind every misunderstood monster is a human frailty that we recognize all too well.\n\n\n\nLuckily for his patient and supportive family, his internet superstar status has led to much real world success. He tours extensively in the US, Canada, the UK, and Europe. His song \"Code Monkey\" was used as the theme for the G4 animated series \"Code Monkeys,\" and in 2007 he was tapped to write \"Still Alive,\" the closing song to the award-winning game Portal. That song won the Game Audio Network Guild's \"Best Original Vocal Pop Song\" award in 2008, and has been called the greatest video game ending song of all time. If you yourself can't sing it all the way through, chances are your children can. In 2011 he was asked back to write \"Want You Gone,\" the closing song for Portal's long-awaited and critically acclaimed sequel.\n\n\n\nArtificial Heart is Coulton's first album of new material since Thing a Week, and it features an actual kickass band made up of actual kickass musicians, the delicious high production values of a real recording studio, and the talents of guest vocalists and actual famous people Suzanne Vega, John Roderick of The Long Winters, and Sara Quin of Tegan and Sara. It springs from a brief run opening for They Might Be Giants that ended with member John Flansburgh offering to produce Coulton's next record - a collaboration that fans of both acts have been waiting for their entire lives, whether they know it or not.", "otherInfo": "TED Talks are influential videos from expert speakers on education, business, science, tech, and creativity.

He embarked upon a bold experiment called Thing a Week, in which he home-recorded and released a new song every week for an entire year, giving them all away for free. Even he thought he was crazy. But while a struggling music industry fell to pieces over filesharing and shifting business models, Jonathan Coulton quietly and independently amassed a small army of techies, nerds, and dedicated superfans who buy his music even though they don't have to.\n\n\n\nCoulton speaks to the outcast in all of us, in the voices of characters we know from our own sad little lives: the awkward, lovelorn mad scientist from \"Skullcrusher Mountain,\" the powerless wage slave from \"Code Monkey,\" and the annoying former coworker turned zombie from the anthemic ode to office doublespeak, \"Re: Your Brains.\" His songs resonate because he transcends what might otherwise be a gimmicky genre of songwriting - behind every misunderstood monster is a human frailty that we recognize all too well.\n\n\n\nLuckily for his patient and supportive family, his internet superstar status has led to much real world success. He tours extensively in the US, Canada, the UK, and Europe. His song \"Code Monkey\" was used as the theme for the G4 animated series \"Code Monkeys,\" and in 2007 he was tapped to write \"Still Alive,\" the closing song to the award-winning game Portal. That song won the Game Audio Network Guild's \"Best Original Vocal Pop Song\" award in 2008, and has been called the greatest video game ending song of all time. If you yourself can't sing it all the way through, chances are your children can. In 2011 he was asked back to write \"Want You Gone,\" the closing song for Portal's long-awaited and critically acclaimed sequel.\n\n\n\nArtificial Heart is Coulton's first album of new material since Thing a Week, and it features an actual kickass band made up of actual kickass musicians, the delicious high production values of a real recording studio, and the talents of guest vocalists and actual famous people Suzanne Vega, John Roderick of The Long Winters, and Sara Quin of Tegan and Sara. It springs from a brief run opening for They Might Be Giants that ended with member John Flansburgh offering to produce Coulton's next record - a collaboration that fans of both acts have been waiting for their entire lives, whether they know it or not.", "otherInfo": "In the Venn diagram of music, comedy, and geek culture, you will find this show sitting squarely in the intersection of all sets.

To some, Glitterer seeed to manifest the parallel identity, something between an alter-ego and a superego, of Ned Russin, who wrote, sang, and played every note of the EP\u2019s eight songs. Ned Russin is a New Yorker, by way of Northeastern Pennsylvania, a 29-year-old bassist and singer who made his name in music by playing in a band called Title Fight.\n\nGlitterer features spartan instrumentation \u2014 bass, drum machine, synths, and a familiar voice \u2014 and its compositional ethos, such as the listener can grasp, lies in hyper-efficient deployment of discrete harmonic and melodic ideas, also known as verses, choruses, and bridges. The introspective but gnomic lyrics address the kinds of ontological, existential, epistemological, ethical, and moral questions one would expect might occur to a 20-something liberal-arts college student (which Ned was, at Columbia, at the time of Glitterer\u2019s release) all while wryly acknowledging the predictability of such heady questions\u2019 arising under such heady conditions.\n\nNot Glitterer, a five-song follow-up, appeared eight months later. As is suggested by the antinomic title, the newer EP is even more preoccupied with contemplating the exigencies and implications of regarding oneself and of regarding oneself regarding oneself and, of course, of regarding oneself regarding oneself regarding oneself. And, as with the first record, no song extends a second beyond what\u2019s necessary to deliver the minimally viable aesthetic and intellectual goods. One would be hard-pressed to name an artist that conveyed a higher concentration of stimulation and aural pleasure in 2017 and 2018.\n\nAt this point in the story, Glitterer was all but bound to be forced into certain boxes. Here we had what appeared, at a casual glance, to be an erstwhile rock musician\u2019s inevitable solo-electro project, consisting as it did of cleverly written songs whose principal subject was the very self that had conceived them. And this at a time when the most talked-about independent musicians were radically self-involved \u201cSoundcloud rappers,\u201d a time whose zeitgeist, engineered in large part by Silicon Valley\u2019s oligarchs and their data-harvesting social networks, produced and nurtured the most narcissistic individuals in the most narcissistic moment in the history of the most narcissistic society in the history of the world. In this context, Glitterer must be a low- or no-stakes novelty exercise in recreational solipsism. Or else one disingenuous man\u2019s cynical bid for a slice of the post-Lil Peep streaming-revenue pie. Or else a bit of self-serious critical-theory cosplay meant to flatter the intellectual vanity of budding coastal elites. Or maybe a toxic mix of all three?\n\nBut anyone harbouring such suspicions was disabused of them as soon as they saw Glitterer play live during this period. Recordings are plastic objects (in more senses than one) onto which listeners project their biases: A musician who tries to convey vulnerability, earnestness, or self-effacement solely through records is at the mercy of those who would superimpose onto them their own cynicism. (This is, after all the most narcissistic moment in the history of the most narcissistic society in the history of the world.) Live performance is different: A musician who goes out of his way to commune in good faith with people who themselves have gone out of their way to stand together in a room \u2014 such a musician is not so easily dismissed. And so it was that, accompanied only by a microphone stand and a Mac laptop perched on a stool like a standup comic\u2019s glass of water, Ned performed 42 U.S. shows from 2017 to 2019, mostly opening for punk and hardcore bands. His dad called it his karaoke act.\n\nBut the live show, too, was a contingency, a temporary means to an end that, like the EP\u2019s, occluded an essential paradox: Glitterer is a solo project, Glitterer is Ned Russin \u2014 but Glitterer is, and has always been, a band.\n\nHence Looking Through The Shades, Glitterer\u2019s debut full-length album, out on Anti- in summer 2019. Recorded in the cozy carpeted basement of the Russin family home, in Kingston, Pa., and co-produced by indie-rock prodigy Alexander Giannascoli and the Arthur Rizk (Code Orange, Power Trip, Sumerlands, the 2018 Grammy Awards), the album not only contains Glitterer\u2019s best-yet sonics and songs; it has been constructed in such a way as to evince a spirit \u2014 co-operative, semi-schizophrenic, greater than the sum of its parts \u2014 that is proper to rock bands and that is inaccessible to even the least self-involved Soundcloud rappers and bedroom artists.\n\nSimply put, Looking Through The Shade is the sound of a group of people playing music, together, in a room. Now we have live drums (Ned\u2019s brother Ben does the honours) and dopamine-releasing fuzzy guitars (Ned\u2019s other brother Alex contributes a solo) to go with the synths, the bass, and the voice. Now we have a 14-song-long thematic arc, carefully sequenced. Meanwhile, the lyrics are still reluctantly but rigorously self-aware, the choruses are still habit-formingly catchy, and the arrangements still carry not an ounce of excess fat. From the saturated distortion of the opener, \u201cThe Race\u201d (\u201cI wish I could look at your life and know it\u2019s mine\u201d), through the road-weary \u201c1001\u201d (\u201cI sang 1,000 songs / Didn\u2019t want to sing again\u201d) and the vox-and-bass-only Side B outlier \u201cThe News\u201d (\u201cI used to be original\u201d), listeners are invited to join the album\u2019s team of creators in wrestling with the defining psychological and social conditions of our age. And thus we discover that Glitterer invokes solipsism not to glorify or revel in it but to understand and rise above it, and that Glitterer knows that no individual can accomplish such a task alone, which is why Glitterer is a rock band and always has been, even when only one person\u2019s name was attached to it.\n\nGlitterer was born in August 2017 and now, with Looking Through The Shades, Gitterer has come of age.", "otherInfo": "Snappy, hooky punk and post-hardcore influenced melodic pop music."}, {"Address": "444 Battery Street, San Francisco, CA 94111", "Artist": "Mike Falzone", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9022657.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.399943, 37.795514], "Date": "Sun Jan 19 2020", "EventDate": "2020-01-19", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Punchline San Francisco", "moreBioInfo": "Mike Falzone has been solving the internet\u2019s problems since 2006 when he became one of the first creators to establish themselves on YouTube.
