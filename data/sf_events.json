They're joined by Boots and The Kats and Lil' Elephant. DASH is a progressive electro-soul duo, featuring lush synths, live keys, bass, and guitar, dynamic electronic percussion, and their signature vocal harmonies. DASH began in February 2018, after lead members Kayti Korte and Ben Morris began writing songs together. The vocal powerhouse duo aimed for a full band sound rooted in rock 'n roll, soul, and funk. The band played their first show in March 2018, and released their debut single, 'Apathy', in May 2018, followed by their debut album, 'SUPER', in October 2018. 'SUPER' is the sound of that first, fiery rock band. Upon releasing their debut album, DASH hit the road. In their first year they were named \"Best New Local Band\" and had the #2 \"Best New Album\" by the Bozeman Magazine. On January 1st, 2019, DASH lost their drummer, immediately after replacing their bass player. Not being able to find a replacement two weeks out from a tour, they were pushed to find alternatives to keep moving. An entire tour with MIDI drums spurred their EP 'Desperate Electric into existence. After losing their second bass player, the pair took to the studio themselves, recording everything themselves, and co-producing the EP with local producer Patch William.After touring all spring, DASH hits the road in their current form; progressive electro-soul, foreshadowed by their EP 'Desperate Electric'.

It is the title of W.H. Auden's final long poem, charting one man's quest to find substance and identity in a shifting and increasingly industrialised world. Published in 1947, it seems fitting that Auden's rumination on human isolation in the modern age should be used as the title for Pixx's debut album -- ostensibly placing herself outside looking in, The Age Of The Anxiety looks instead to address a generation increasingly isolated by an unprecedented new world, from the pressures of social media to ever-changing political turbulence.Originally from Chipstead, just beyond the fringes of south London where suburban sprawl starts to break into countryside, Hannah's is a family of music lovers and her early life was soundtracked by her father's expansive record collection; she has previously cited acts as diverse as Joni Mitchell, Kate Bush and Altered Images. Encouraged to sing and write, these formative years led to her creative talents being recognised by the prestigious BRIT School. Aged 16, and already with a number of her own songs sketched out, Rodgers enrolled at the renowned performing arts college, previously attended by the likes of Adele, Amy Winehouse and King Krule. It was only after graduating that she begin to think of doing anything with her own music, resisting the more mainstream route traditionally taken by her peers. Adopting her grandmother's nickname, Pixx was born.Signed to venerable indie label 4AD at just 19, Pixx released her first collection of music, Fall In, in 2015. An EP of four folk-infused torch songs, it is, by Rodgers' own admission, a deeply personal collection writ of heartbreak and introspection. Fall In went down a storm amongst critics, with The Sunday Times calling it \"one of the most arresting debuts of the year.\" The critical attention helped her secure crucial slots at Glastonbury and Latitude festivals, whilst she was also invited to perform with the likes of Daughter, Lush and Glass Animals amongst others.Hannah remembers her first awareness of anxiety; aged 9, confused by an insomnia caused by recurring nightmares. The perpetual cycle from sleep deprivation to lucid dreams lasted just a year, but left a lasting impression, inspiring a fascination with the self and how it can be discovered in different states of consciousness, especially for a vivid dreamer. This is one of many somnolent experiences that she draws upon for her anticipated debut album, The Age Of Anxiety, released later this year on 4AD.With the outside world in turmoil, Rodgers looked internally for inspiration. Those childhood nightmares, and later visceral dreams, provided the perfect metaphors to unpick the current topics of the moment, to seize some sort of control when all around seems to lost. Instead of tales of loss, Rodgers found herself writing from the perspective of a social commentator, exploring the sense of unease ignited initially by her nightmares and later her waking reality. The spiralling 'Waterslides' recounts a nightmare of being trapped in a waterpark surrounded by faceless figures dressed in business suits, whilst 'A Big Cloud To Float Upon' details one of the first formative memories Hannah is able to clearly recall.A compulsive writer, 'Everything Is Weird In America' is a line Hannah scribbled in a notebook during her first visit to New York. Although intended to be tongue-in-cheek, it is prescient in the way it depicts the Free World's current state of uncertainty, increasingly poignant given the ongoing climate. In contrast, 'Grip' is about going through life looking backwards, but interminably moving forwards into the unknown, echoing a generation lost in time.An ambitious debut statement, The Age Of Anxiety represents the first true statement from a unique British talent, drawing on deeply personal experiences to present a bold, relatable new commentary on her world order.\nRosie Tucker\nrosie's the best, dude. like hands down the best. for some people it's like, a herculean effort to put intelligible words over music that doesn't sound absolutely insane. but rosie just is like, \"hey, here's this song i wrote in 20 minutes\" and then she plays you the coolest, catchiest, most clever song you'll hear all year. damn, rosie. how do we get to be like you, rosie? she's also very nice which is a quality that i hear a lot of people enjoy. indie rock with music for the heart and lyrics for the brain - WOLFY\nSour Widows", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Cafe Du Nord"}, {"Address": "Gayley & University, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Weird Al' Yankovic", "ArtistBio": "No artist bio available", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.27, 37.87], "Date": "Fri Aug 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-08-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "\u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic at UC Berkeley, Greek Theatre:", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "UC Berkeley, Greek Theatre"}, {"Address": "707 Marina Vista Ave, Martinez, CA 94553", "Artist": "Quinn Deveaux", "ArtistBio": "Quinn DeVeaux has the smoothest yet dirty spank you voice we've heard in decades.

Her raw performance is contrasted with her infectiously goofy personality that shines through on stage between songs, as well as off stage and provides a balance that makes her relatable. This magnetic polarity has allowed her to share the stage with national acts such as Andy Grammer, Us the Duo, Jason Mraz, and Dan Reynolds of Imagine Dragons. Ashley grew up singing in church but music wasn\u2019t at the forefront. It wasn\u2019t until she moved to Utah that she started digging into writing and performing. It's there that she started creating her own music which ignited her passion.\n\nHess has released three original singles, one of which, \u201cRunning\u201d, was release in August of 2018.

After honing his chops during the mid-1960s backing acts ranging from Ronnie Hawkins, Lonnie Mack the Four Tops to James Brown. He first performed with Garcia at the weekly jam sessions with bassist John Kahn and drummer Bill Vitt at the Bay Area club the Matrix, and in 1970 resulting in the classic Hooteroll? album. Howard also played on the Dead's seminal American Beauty. For over the last four decades now, Wales has been quietly and meticulously self-producing and releasing high quality instrumental albums as an independent recording artist in Northern California. Howard\u2019s rare live performances remain the stuff of myth and legend.\nGuitarist, Terry Haggerty is buried treasure. As guitarist with the Sons of Champlin, Haggerty was always accorded the full respect of his peers on the '60s San Francisco rock scene like Jerry Garcia, Jorma Kaukonen, Carlos Santana. He has been known -- throughout the world -- among guitar cognoscenti via the handful of recordings he made over the two decades of the Sons' existence. Some of his demo tapes have attracted intense interest inside the industry over the years. But even now he remains something of an unknown, a titan hiding in the hills, a legend waiting to be discovered.\nKevin Hayes is a Bay Area based drummer & songwriter, probably best known for his 20 years as the drummer for The Robert Cray Band. During his time with Cray from 1989-2008, he recorded 9 studio albums and one double live disc, recorded over a seven show run at London\u2019s historic Royal Albert Hall opening for Eric Clapton. He has played on records by John Lee Hooker, B.B. King, Van Morrison, among many others.

Hosted by Willa Mamet.\n\nHERE'S HOW IT WORKS:\n\n- Doors open at 7pm, lottery for performance spots is held at 7:20. The show starts promptly at 7:30.\n\n- Free to play, free to listen\n\n- Solo performers get to play one song; groups get to play two songs. Management reserves the right to award a performer an extra song now and then, for any reason management deems appropriate.\n\nImportant Notes:\n\nPlease be a considerate performer and refrain from tuning or practicing in the listening room. We ask that you go outside the venue to practice rather than practicing in the lobby, as it is distracting and can be heard from within the listening room.\n\nAvailable Equipment: performers will have access to the piano on stage, microphones, instrument line-in, and iPhone/iPod line-in.\n\nPlease note that there is no drum kit on stage, and due to time constraints we ask that performers not bring a kit to set up. More portable percussion instruments are welcome.\n\nPlease be ready to perform when your turn comes up. Please limit your introduction to 30 seconds.\n\nTune up, drop in, go on!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Your RSVP does not enter you into the lottery drawing for a performance spot.
