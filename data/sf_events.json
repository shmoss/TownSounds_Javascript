Originally from Seattle, Washington, she busked her way down the West Coast in 2010 on a road trip that led her to put down roots in San Francisco\u2019s North Bay\u2014 Sonoma County, California. The two locals heavily influenced her first two albums\u2014 Americana Folk songs and Indie ballads, with undertones of Seattle 90\u2019s grunge. Clementine has played festivals including The Emerald Cup, sharing the bill with Margo Price and Rising Appalachia, as well as SXSW, Railroad Square Music Festival and Balanced BreakFEST.\n\nwww.clementinedarlingmusic.com\nIG: @clementinedarlingmusic\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/7yjaAoQo650uEgATVqgwQj?si=sMW2VmnASpqLjIRLRW50QQ\n\nMAAYAN\n\nSoulful Singer-Songwriter Maayan Oppenheim is a wild child artist captivating crowds internationally with powerful performances and magnetic positivity.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings.

Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. He\u2019s never more than one degree away from a powerful musical hook-up.", "otherInfo": "Erik Deutsch (Piano/keys) & Scott Amendola (drums/percussion/electronics) Duo\n\nAfter a chance meeting in Boulder, CO in the early 2000s, Scott Amendola and Erik Deutsch have collaborated frequently and feverishly ever since.

Hailing from Red Bank, New Jersey, the group was founded by Dave Wyndorf (vocals and guitar), John McBain (guitar), Tom Diello (drums), and Tim Cronin (vocals and bass). The band first went under the name \"Dog of Mystery\" and later \"Airport 75\", before finally settling on \"Monster Magnet\".\n\nIn 1989, Monster Magnet released two demo cassettes; \"Forget About Life, I'm High on Dope\" and \"I'm Stoned, What Ya Gonna Do About It?\". The band's first 'official' release was a self-titled EP from Glitterhouse Records of Germany. In 1991 the band signed with Caroline Records and released their first full length album, the cult classic Spine of God, in 1991. The next release was a bizarre 4 song EP titled Tab which included, among two other marathon length songs, a 32 minute track called \"Tab...\". McBain was fired soon after, due to personality conflicts between himself and Dave Wyndorf. He was replaced by Atomic Bitchwax guitarist Ed Mundell; who holds the position to this day.\n\nThe year 1993 saw the release of the album Superjudge. While the album was released on major record label (A&M Records) and is considered a cult favorite among fans of the band's earlier work, the album did not sell very well. The follow-up, a more pop-influenced album, was Dopes to Infinity had a hit single in \"Negasonic Teenage Warhead\" but still did only slightly better than Superjudge. Wyndorf moved to Las Vegas, Nevada in order to begin working on Powertrip (1998), a breakthrough hit that earned a gold certification. Powertrip saw the band departing from its usual lo-fi, stoner rock fare, and enter into an era with more guitar and heavier drum beats. Guitarist Phil Cavaino joined the band in 1998. \"Space Lord\", the first single, was a major radio hit and the band went on tour with bands like Aerosmith, Metallica and Marilyn Manson. Their last album on A&M Records was God Says No (2000). After this release, Joe Calandra and Jon Kleiman departed the band due to internal conflicts with Wyndorf, and were replaced by Jim Baglino and Bob Pantella respectively. In 2003, Monster Magnet signed to the European label SPV, and in early 2004 released Monolithic Baby! throughout Europe. The U.S. release followed in May on SPV America. In March 2005 Phil Cavaino departed after 7 years service in a split described as amicable by Wyndorf. A followup to Monolithic Baby! was expected in March 2006 to coincide with their European Tour, along with rereleases of Spine of God and Tab, both featuring new artwork and liner notes, however the tour and album release did not go ahead. A DVD is also planned for late 2006.\n\nOn February 27, 2006 Dave Wyndorf overdosed on prescription drugs. His management released the following statement\n\n\"The battle with one\u2019s inner demons is the most personal fight any of us can undertake. The fight is at times a lonely, confusing journey. On the evening of February 27, Dave Wyndorf suffered a set back in his own fight and was hospitalized due to a drug overdose. His full recovery is expected. We ask that all those he has encountered over the years or simply affected by his music to take a moment to think good thoughts of and for him. With the grace of God and those who love him we are all confident that Dave will rebound from this set back and continue to play and make great rock and roll.\"\n\nMonster Magnet's style and material are heavily influenced by 1970s-era space rock bands such as Hawkwind and Captain Beyond. In addition to arranging covers such as Hawkwind's \"Brainstorm\" (Doremi Fasol Latido, 1972), Wyndorf sometimes incorporates elements of space rock staples into his own songs. For instance, the Dopes to Infinity title track borrows some of its lyrics from \"Lord of Light\" (ibid.), and Superjudge's \"Twin Earth\" is a reinterpretation of Captain Beyond's \"Mesmerization Eclipse\" (Captain Beyond, 1972). Monster Magnet's live shows occasionally feature Stacia-esque nude dancers, a fact which has landed them in trouble with the law in some American cities.", "otherInfo": "Monster Magnet - Powertrip: A Celebration"}]
