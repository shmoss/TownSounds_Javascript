His unique sandy tenor and masterful blend of rhythm and melody draw comparison to Paul Simon and contemporaries Josh Ritter and Jason Mraz. He wins song competitions. He fills rooms. But most of all he moves people.\n\nFirst time listeners often are drawn to Garveys engaging performance style, accomplished musicianship, and memorable melodies. But his lyrics project a depth and sincerity that allow the observant listener to find meaning beyond the catchy hook. Meanwhile, the intricate production of his albums adds emotional depth and keeps the songs fresh play after play.\n\nThis combination of songwriting and performance strength has earned Garvey numerous awards including being named winner of the Kerrville New Folk, Rocky Mountain Folks Fest, SolarFest, Wildflower Art and Music Festival and Maine Songwriters Association songwriting competitions, voted as Most Wanted artist at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, nominated for Best Male Performer in the New England Music Awards, and a top new singer songwriter by Sirius XM's The Coffeehouse.\n\nOn his latest release, Meteors and Beating Hearts, Garvey shows further maturity as a songwriter, addressing personal and universal themes through a series of lyrical stories. Many of the songs were written as assignments for a weekly songwriting group. The challenge of writing a new song each week and presenting it to a group of artists he admires challenged and pushed Garvey to try a new approach to his songwriting.\n\nGarveys interest in music and writing began at a very young age. Both his parents are educators and his father was a songwriter. Growing up in such a musical environment in the artistically rich Northeast, Garvey developed the firm belief that songwriting is a method for bringing community together and a way for people to explore a greater depth within their own lives.\n\nOriginally a drummer, he picked up the guitar in his teens, in part because his best friend was better with the sticks and together they could start a rock band. But this rhythmic background remains at the core of his musical style. He merges syncopated bass lines with melodic leads to create a full sound from his acoustic guitar.\n\nThe themes of community and living with intention run deep for Garvey, from the musical memories of his youth to his ease in developing relationships with audiences and fellow artists. He builds upon on the energy of live performance to deliver a memorable experience in a way that has led folk stalwarts Vance Gilbert and David Wilcox to proclaim the tradition of acoustic music is in good hands with Connor Garvey.\n\n*2015 Rocky Mountain Folks Fest Main Stage Performer\n\n*2015 Kerrville Folk Festival Main Stage Performer\n\n*2014 Kerrville Folk Festival Grassyhill NEW FOLK WINNER\n\n*2014 Rocky Mountain Folks Fest Singer Songwriter Showcase Winner\n\n*2014 SolarfestSinger-Songwriter Showcase Winner\n\n*2014 Nominee for New England Music Award Best Male Artist\n\n*2014 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival MOST WANTED Artist (crowd voted)\n\n*2012 Winner of Wildflower Festival Singer Songwriter Competition\n\n*2010, 2011, & 2012 Rocky Mountain Folks Fest Singer Songwriter Honorable Mention\n\n*2011, 2012, & 2013 Telluride Troubadour Competition Honorable Mention\n\n*2011 Winner of Maine Songwriters Associations Annual Songwriting Competition\n\n*Top 6 Sirius XM's The Coffeehouse's New Singer Songwriter of 2010", "otherInfo": "Moving our Falmouth Coffee House show to the digital realm!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brooks Wheelan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9618928.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "THIS IS AN ONLINE EVENT"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Carhartt ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Christie Lenee ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9072233.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Asheville, North Carolina", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer, songwriter and renowned fingerstyle guitarist Christie Len\u00e9e is more than a musician \u2013 she\u2019s an experience. Symphonic compositions flow from her fingertips effortlessly, with sound ranging from transcendental folk-pop to virtuosic instrumentals. Christie is often described as \u2018Michael Hedges meets Joni Mitchell and Dave Matthews,\u201d integrating melodic pop lyricism with catchy hooks and percussive, harmonic textures. As an Official Showcase Artist at Folk Alliance International consistently logging a number of major festivals, events, opera houses and theaters nationwide, Christie Len\u00e9e performs with radiant joy that awes crowds and inspires fellow musicians. She recently told Digital Journal that \"years ago, I set my intention to be an inspirational songwriter, though over time I've come to realize that inspiration comes in many forms. Talking about the dark and the light, the beauty and moments of pain are all forms of inspiration.\"\n\nChristie has shared stages with Tommy Emmanuel, Tim Reynolds (Dave Matthews Band), Andy McKee, and Amy Ray (Indigo Girls) to name a few, who have all raved about her talents (see below). Her first place victory in the acclaimed 2017 International Fingerstyle Guitar Championship has earned her featured coverage in Guitar Player Magazine, Acoustic Guitar Magazine, and Premier Guitar. She has released five albums, with \u201cSTAY\u201d one of three finalists for \u201cBest CD of 2016\u201d (Indie Acoustic Project Awards). The album includes three instrumentals produced by Grammy Award Winning producer Will Ackerman, founder of Windham Hill Records, and a music video for the title track supporting a movement on suicide prevention.\n\nChristie\u2019s live shows present a menu of percussive and sonic effects, larger than life sounding instruments, her solo shows embody layers of orchestral elements with a wide array of dynamics and harmonic textures. In 2018 Christie released an arrangement of Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d which garnered media attention across several Digital Publications. AXS.com's Jim Wood noted \"through the use of harmonics and tapping, Len\u00e9e's infectious style utilizes all parts of the guitar and combines elements of folk, rock and pop into one tasty and eclectic musical stew.\"\n\nWith over 12,000 fans on Facebook and nearly half a million plays on YouTube, Christie continues to spread the love of music through live performance, radio airplay and appearances on multiple television stations. Her most recent music video \"Call My Heart Back Home\" premiered via Acoustic Guitar Magazine. Her next video, \u201cFree World Citizen\u201d, is an anthem expressing the connection of all beings. As an artist, she hopes to bring joy, freedom, and light to the world though the love of music.\n\n\u201cChristie Len\u00e9e is a wonderful spirit making beautiful music on the guitar.

R. Castillo. While a lot of artists can say the same, the influence of music on Castillo\u2019s life began years before he was born. When Castillo\u2019s father was a boy, he idolized his brother who was nine years older and in the Navy. Castillo\u2019s uncle would come home on leave from the Navy and play guitar on the front porch, and Castillo\u2019s father aspired to play just like his older brother. Tragically, his uncle lost his life serving in the Navy and his father\u2014now the oldest son and responsible for his family\u2014never learned to play like he wanted. \u201cAs he got older [my father] said, \u2018If I ever have a son, I want to put a guitar in his hands and make sure he learns to play,\u2019\u201d Castillo says, and to honor the brother he lost, Castillo\u2019s father put a guitar into his son\u2019s hands at a very early age. His mother also loved music. She encouraged him to sing and find harmonies as she introduced him to all kinds of music, and both his father and mother\u2014a \u201ccloset poet\u201d and \u201cgrammar queen,\u201d respectively\u2014encouraged their son to write. It was no surprise then when their son was fronting bands and performing his own music by the time he was 13. With the bands he was in during middle and high school, Castillo would work his own original music into sets of well-known covers at parties and festivals, and the reaction was always very positive. \u201cIt always seemed that every time I\u2019d announce, \u2018Here\u2019s a song that I wrote,\u2019 it immediately drew people in, which caught my attention,\u201d Castillo recalls. \u201cI saw that people all the sudden weren\u2019t just out there dancing and having a good time, their attention was on the song that I\u2019d written. The reaction of those first few folks\u2014they don\u2019t realize it, the influence they had\u2014as they were out there listening and giving me those words of encouragement after they heard the songs, it really encouraged me to continue with the song writing. It really set me on the path that I\u2019m on today.\u201d Despite his early success, he didn\u2019t immediately run off to Nashville to pursue a record deal; his family assumed that first he would get a college education, though they encouraged him to continue with his music while doing so. However, avoiding the temptation to quit college wasn\u2019t easy when record labels started showing interest during his sophomore year. \u201cIt kind of scared my folks a little bit, because they thought that I was just going to stop everything and pack my bags and move to Nashville. It just seemed like the right thing at that point in time.\u201d It was the advice of friend Casey Monahan at the Texas Music Office that persuaded him he could do both, a decision he\u2019s happy with in retrospect: \u201cI often look back at that moment and I know that it didn\u2019t have a huge an impact. If I had moved over there, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. I was still able to do everything they wanted us to do, but at the same time we were still able to take care of things at home and I was able to continue my education.\u201d Over the last 15 years\u2014through his formative years, his time at the University of Texas, and up to the present day\u2014Castillo has written over a thousand songs for himself and other artists, 25 percent of which are in Spanish. His songwriting strays from that of many other artists, as his music is often more specific and personal than other artists\u2019 music. \u201cA lot of the stuff is based on life experiences and stuff that I\u2019ve gone through, personal stories,\u201d Castillo says of his songwriting. \u201cI try to take actual stories and actual experiences and lay them out in that three and a half minute length of a song.\u201d For Castillo, the joy of songwriting isn\u2019t in mass appeal, but connecting on a deeper, more-personal level with his listeners. \u201cI want to write about real things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about writing the basic love songs where everybody can relate. I want to write about stuff that people out there listening can actually hold on to and say, \u201cThat\u2019s my song. That guy wrote that song about my life and what I\u2019m going through.\u201d His latest single, \u201cThe Flip Side of Sober,\u201d was released on July 4, and is apart of a full CD release entitled The Hombre that Castillo expects to be released in late September. Other songs on the 16-track album include the classic Leo Sayer hit, \u201cMore Than I Can Say\u201d (one of his mother\u2019s favorites), and unofficial Texas High School football anthem, \u201cAny Given Friday.\u201d \u201cSome of my fellow artists and writers are like, \u2018Man you\u2019re nuts. You\u2019re the only one who would serve up that many songs in one project,\u2019\u201d Castillo remarks. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s music. I\u2019m cranking it out. I feel blessed to be able to write as much as I do. It gives me an opportunity to share some of myself with the fans.\u201d By Andrew Miller, Nashville Music Guide", "otherInfo": "Herrman & Herrman presents Curbside Live\n\nBrewster Street Ice House - South Side\n\nHerrman & Herrman, PLLC presents Curbside Live Music Series every Friday night!\n\nLive Music in the beer garden every Friday from 6-9 PM\n\nMay 8th - J.R.

Titled Dude, The Obscure, the album is a work that Morris says, \"flowed from a creative space I found at the intersection of dreams and reality.\" In captivating songs, Morris sheds the traps of ambition and nostalgia and uncovers the strange satisfaction of living in the moment.\n\nEven the album title, Dude, The Obscure, hints at self-discovery. In an homage to English author Thomas Hardy\u2019s novel, \u201cJude, The Obscure,\u201d Morris reveals his love for literature, philosophy and poetry \u2014 along with a secret about his stage name.\n\n\u201cThomas Hardy is my given name, and Dude, The Obscure is a moniker I considered using as an artist,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThe hat tip to the novel seemed appropriate for the album because it deals with doubts, joys, regrets and spirituality, a lifelong journey and such.\"\n\nEach song on the album seems compelled by Morris\u2019 desire to help himself\u2014 and others\u2014 conquer the void of everyday meaninglessness. It\u2019s an effort philosopher Maurice Blanchot described as the anguish of writing: \u201cYou have to cross an abyss, and if you do not jump, you do not comprehend.\u201d Morris takes that leap to find universal truth by navigating sometimes opposing perspectives within moments that change lives. Morris beautifully warns us not to succumb to the fear of missing out that stands in the way of contentment on the album\u2019s defining moment, \u201cCheating Life, Living Death.\u201d Every dream is an invitation/ To leave your love up on the shelf/ When you walk out every evening/ Cheating life and living death.\"\n\nFor the sessions, Morris made the familiar pilgrimage to Adam Landry\u2019s home studio in Nashville. The longtime collaborators took their time and gave each song the opportunity to grow unaffected by outside influence except the magic that happens when two friends lock themselves in a smoky shed to make music, and a few pals stop by.\n\nWithin 11 powerful songs, the Athens rocker reveals scars and shares lessons from an indie-rock odyssey that has taken him around the world and back home to find himself a little older and closer to something like enlightenment.\n\nAnd just in time for a new journey to begin.", "otherInfo": "THIS FRIDAY 5/8, Georgia Theatre is collaborating with Creature Comforts and Tweed Recording to host a special \"Live From Over There\" event to benefit Nu\u00e7i's Space Garrie Vereen Memorial Emergency Relief Fund.\n\nThe live-stream will feature special performances by Futurebirds, Faye Webster and T.

My passion for music was passed down from generation to generation, but some of my earliest influences came from my dad and my love for artists like John Cougar Mellencamp, Black Hawk and Garth Brooks.\n\nAfter graduating high school, I moved to Atlanta where my brother Sean and I started the power-pop band, Loverush, which was influenced by some of our favorite artists at the time: the Goo Goo Dolls, Greenday and Cheap Trick. The band ended abruptly in 2009 when our grandparents died, then our father just a few months later. Sean moved 3000 miles away and joined the military and my music career faded. I worked a landscape job and married the love of my life. My marriage would later become a catalyst for change I never knew could emerge.\n\nIn 2012, my wife and I moved back home to Birmingham. I found myself in music again, learning how to make a living performing covers for the first time. Who knew playing other people\u2019s music would be a platform for finding my way again?\n\nHowever, the booze, the partying, the late nights, even the pride and selfishness that grew inside got the best of me and, therefore, my relationship. At the time of releasing, \u201cHey Y\u2019all\u201d in 2015, my first single and music video as a returning original artist, my wife left. I was on the road and we separated. I found myself alone in an empty apartment, falling deeper into my lifestyle and into a depression. After a four-day binge and an episode where I thought I might die, I finally asked for help. Tired of trying, tired of pushing, tired of losing it all to a dream; motivated by my own ego, I got down on my knees and gave it all to God.\n\nIt started with giving up my obsession with alcohol. On my road to recovery God has renewed my mind and my spirit and He has rejuvenated my sense of self-worth. A lot has changed after three years of sobriety. Since then I have started touring, surrounded myself with family and friends and finished an album that I\u2019m proud to share with the world. My hope and prayer is that my music would inspire and encourage everyone who hears to do whatever \u201cIt\u201d is; because Sooner or Later whatever \u201cIt\u201d is, is going to \u2013 so let it.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Emily Hope Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9841467.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 8 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-08", "Genre": "Pop, Indie, Christian, Country, Folk", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Emily Hope is a smiley 24-year-old singer/songwriter, guitarist, and ukulele player currently based in Bloomington, IL.

His voice is weathered by life\u2019s detours and disappointments and strengthened by his dreams and determination. His music is infused with relentless intensity, both of passion and frustration. The boy who grew up daydreaming about life outside of the small town of Tifton, Ga., became a man who has been continually inspired by Bruce Springsteen and Kris Kristofferson to paint vivid portraits with his lyrics. \u201cI am not drawn to the fairytale kind of love,\u201d says Kip, who had a hand in writing every song on his debut album. \u201cI am drawn to the real-life experiences between a woman and a man. I try to sing about the way it is, but yet at the same time, what you can hope for between a couple. I don\u2019t intend to paint of picture of what it\u2019s really not.\u201d His music powerfully captures some of the contradictions that he grapples with personally. Although he\u2019s from a large family and enjoys musical collaborations and performing onstage, he\u2019s an introvert who is often more comfortable being alone. \u201cThere\u2019s a combativeness to the music too, a fight within,\u201d he says. \u201cWith \u2018Faith When I Fall,\u2019 I know how bad I need that spiritual realm, but yet I find myself on this other end a lot of times.\u201d Despite its edge, his music remains desperately optimistic. \u201cI am hoping for what I have yet to become,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s hopeful for what I\u2019ve yet reached, how I look forward to feeling, but I haven\u2019t gotten there yet. \u201cI have truly lived my music to a sense, even the milestones I haven\u2019t reached yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been in those moments. I\u2019ve been at those crossroads with a girl: \u2018Are we going to take that next step?\u2019 I look forward to taking that next step, but I haven\u2019t wanted to yet. I look forward to being ready for that.\u201d He was born in Tifton, near the Florida line, and was one of six children, the youngest boy who had three younger sisters. \u201cYou had to make your own fun, for sure,\u201d he says of Tifton. \u201cI had a lot of time for daydreaming. It was a great town, but I dreamed about getting out. I do enjoy going back now.\u201d His father was a golf pro and his mother was a painter who used anything handy for a canvas, whether it was cake plates or baby crates. She also taught piano and played the church organ. \u201cI can remember sleeping in the pews,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe would bring us blankets and give us a coloring book and we\u2019d sit there while she played.\u201d Weekends were often spent driving to the beach with his father for fishing expeditions. \u201cHe would play a lot of Jackson Browne, Willie Nelson, Bob Seger, Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen,\u201d he says. \u201cAs early as I can remember, I always gravitated toward lyrics. Even when I hadn\u2019t lived enough to understand then, they still shaped me. \u201c During high school, he secretly began playing his brother\u2019s guitar because he was intimidated by the talent of his mother and older brother. \u201cI would play when nobody was around, just figuring out stuff, watching his hands and trying to do the same thing.\u201d He played point guard for Wallace State\u2019s basketball team and also played on its golf team in Hanceville, Ala., for two years and then transferred to Valdolsta State University on a golf scholarship. He wrote songs daily and joined a band that performed throughout the South, providing him with all of his income. \u201cI was one of those kinds who didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do with my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know music was an option. Maybe it was one of those things where I didn\u2019t quite believe in myself enough.\u201d Although he devoted every free moment to music during college, his parents still didn\u2019t know about his musical activities. \u201cThey were all shocked when they found out about it because they didn\u2019t know I could sing or play,\u201d he says. After graduation and a short stint as a bartender on St. Simon\u2019s Island, he moved to Hawaii on a whim with just a backpack, a surfboard and a friend. They slept on an airport bench the first night and then lucked into a hut that was $50 a month. They would walk or hitchhike the mile to the beach daily. After six months of this tropical paradise, Kip thought he had found his permanent home until his friend encouraged him to pursue songwriting as a living. \u201cI didn\u2019t know a whole lot about the world of songwriting,\u201d he says. \u201cI just did it for my own enjoyment. We talked about Nashville and I ended up saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to give it a shot.\u2019 I flew back home and told my folks. They thought I was crazy. Now they\u2019ll say different, that they knew all along.\u201d He drove to Nashville on Jan. 1, 2004 in an old black Nissan truck that contained one bag and his guitar. He immersed himself in the songwriting community, observing songwriters\u2019 rounds for two years and honing his craft before gaining the confidence to join in. After four years of performing locally, he caught the attention of Creative Artist Agency\u2019s Mark Dennis, who called Universal Music Group Nashville\u2019s Joe Fisher. Not only did Joe\u2019s encounter lead to his record deal with MCA Nashville, but it also brought about his introduction to songwriter Brett James, who produced Kip\u2019s debut album. \u201cBrett gave me the freedom to find who I was as an artist, the freedom for writing a different kind of thing, a different kind of melody and lyric,\u201d he says. \u201cHe gave me room to grow.\u201d He also found important relationships with songwriters Dan Couch, Scott Steppakoff, Westin Davis and Kiefer Thompson, two of whom didn\u2019t have publishing deals when he began writing with them. \u201cThere was definitely a special thing when we got in the room together,\u201d Kip says. \u201cI got offers to write with a lot of the bigger guns in town, but I enjoyed what I was doing with them. They were open to my ideas of being different.\u201d And different his debut project is, as evidenced by the album\u2019s first single, \u201cMary Was the Marrying Kind,\u201d the story of the one who got away. The dreamy and spell-binding song is the true story of one of Kip\u2019s friends, who returned to his hometown after about six years and saw the once tall, lanky girl who had since come into her own and become a model. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of what every man in this world goes through at some point,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of the one that got away that you should have paid attention to. Every town, every city, everybody knows one. Every girl believes they are Mary.\u201d The anthemic \u201cDrive Me Crazy\u201d is the story of two troubled teens who find a safe harbor in each other, if only for a few fleeting moments. \u201cThey are the getaway car for each other from everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen they\u2019re together, what they live in is in the rear-view mirror and it\u2019s just one big infatuation love story that lasts for a very short time. With its irresistible bass line and drums, \u201cUp All Night\u201d is about continuing to live life to its fullest. \u201c\u2019Up All Night\u2019 is the story of not wanting to give into your age and how life is supposed to be lived once you reach a certain age,\u201d he says. When Kip plays shows, he\u2019s often asked for advice by aspiring songwriters. \u201cEverybody\u2019s experience is different, but I do believe it has to be the only thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can be a gray line. Either you want it and there\u2019s nothing else or it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d For instance, Kip was offered a sales position with an enticing salary, but it required working six days a week, leaving no time for creating music. \u201cYou come to the crossroads: do you really want this? Are you willing to sacrifice everything, including relationships? I can\u2019t tell you how many relationships have been doomed from the get-go because of this. \u201cIt only took me a few minutes to decline it. It\u2019s such a risk and it\u2019s an alone feeling \u2013 you feel like you\u2019re on an island by yourself \u2013 but it\u2019s worth every single minute.

Critics have praised him for a charismatic, personally authentic performance style that has influenced other folk-pop musicians. Though he remains among the most pop-friendly of today's singer-songwriters - his songs regularly appear in hit movie and TV soundtracks , fans say he has bridged the gulf between the modern folk sound and the populist traditions of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger more successfully than any of his songwriting peers. According to an article by Stephen Thanabalan in Rolling Stone Magazine, Paul's style has also been most notably influential in the late 1990s thru mid 2000s with his prescience vis a vis his unique music and sound: featuring a combination of dextrously deep and smooth vocals as well as raw guitar 'roots' stylistics; emulated most evidently in the industry in ensuing years with the mainstream emergence of melancholic rock and folk pop solo artistes like Rascal Flatts, James Blunt, Damien Rice and Jack Johnson.", "otherInfo": "ELLIS PAUL\u2019S TRAVELING MEDICINE SHOW Returns this Friday May 8th at 7:30pm EST on Facebook Live at Ellis Paul Music and More!

In '87 Jask began djing at the age of 13. Influences consisted of soul, jazz, funk, r&b, hip hop, rock, new wave, disco, early electro & freestyle. A year later he would soon discover and quickly embrace a passion for the music that was coming out of Chicago & New York, known as the underground house sound. Jask was one of the major players to introduce the acid jazz sound to Tampa & most of central Florida in the early 90's. He held Tampa's longest running eclectic loungin' night called, \"Martini Jazz\". It took place every Thursday night at a club called the Castle which ran from '94 to '96. The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area. In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\". During its successful over a decade ongoing run, Jask has played alongside various talented djs such as: Mark Farina, Dj Disciple, Benji Candelario, Marques Wyatt, Doug Smith, Brian Tappert , Miguel Migs, King Britt, Tedd Patterson, Tommy Musto, Kaskade, Pete Moss, David Harness, Rasoul, Julius Papp, Matthias Heibronn, Jay-J, Little Louie Vega, Frankie Feliciano, Karizma, Mark Grant, Johnny Fiasco, Diz, Collete, Heather, Tortured Soul, Cevin Fisher, Harry Choo Choo Romero, Cajmere, Lisa Shaw, JJK and many other luminaries in the dance music industry...As of Today, Jask still holds down Jack's House(Tuesdays) and a new night called, \"Paradise\" which has become the new Underground house night in the Tampa area and features guest djs from all around the globe. On the production and remix side of the musical pendulum, Jask has appeared on such notable labels as: Vega, King Street/NiteGrooves, I!Records, Swanky, Metaphor, K2/Vinylicious, Step Ahead, Erotic City, DeepTouch, Harlequin, SoulGroove, Soulfuric Deep, Soulfuric, Soufuric Trax, Catch 22, Deeplay, Solu, Om, Vino, Defected, Undo, Large Music, Salted, Sole Channel, Ultra, Rhythm & Culture, Transport & NeoDisco.

It is a special release in which Jask has dedicated it to his late mother who passed away July 31, 2001. Due to the successful Jacks house night in Tampa and his music productions, Jask has had the luxury of performing/djing across the United States and beyond.

She was raised surrounded by living, breathing roots music\u2014her father\u2019s country band rehearsing; the lively music at church and at community dances; the tunes she rocked out to win fiddle competitions. She thought every little girl learned to stepdance at the age of three and fiddle at the age of six. She knew nothing else and decided early on that she wanted to be a professional musician.\n\nShe took that leap, and for over two decades has been recording and captivating audiences worldwide, exploring new and nuanced places each step of the way. On April 12, 2019, Verch will release her twelfth recording, Once A Day, via Slab Town Records. A followup to her 2017 career-\u00ad\u2010 spanning release The April Verch Anthology, this new album is a heartfelt homage to 1950s and 60s classic country.\n\nRecorded in Nashville by Bil VornDick and produced by Doug Cox, Once A Day features the talents of country veterans including steel guitarist Al Perkins (Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris), guitarist Redd Volkaert (Merle Haggard) and fiddler Kenny Sears (Mel Tillis, Grand Ole Opry). From the title track, a hit debut single for Connie Smith, to Loretta Lynn\u2019s \u201cYou Ain\u2019t Woman Enough,\u201d and Webb Pierce\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re Not Mine Anymore,\u201d the album is a dynamic crash course in one of Country Music\u2019s most influential time periods. Her admiration for these musicians and this iconic era is evident from start to finish. Void of contemporary gimmicks and over-\u00ad\u2010production, Verch revels in the history and lets the music speak for itself.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, making this album was not a choice. It was something I felt I had to do. It has been more daunting than any other project I\u2019ve embarked on, because these songs, these artists, the history of this music matters to me on the deepest level. It is a love letter and a thank you letter in one, to the artists, songwriters, musicians, and industry professionals who created, perhaps in some cases without even realizing it, an era of music that speaks to me in a way that no other music does. If someone hears a song on this album and that prompts them to look up and love the original that will be the highest compliment I could receive,\u201d explains Verch.\n\nWhile Verch is perhaps best known for playing traditional fiddle styles from her native Ottawa Valley, Canada, her performances extend into old-\u00ad\u2010time American and Appalachian styles and far beyond, for a well-\u00ad\u2010rounded tour-\u00ad\u2010de-\u00ad\u2010force of North Americana sounds. Verch and her fellow trio members pare down their arrangements, highlighting the simple pleasures of upright bass, guitar, clawhammer banjo, voices, fiddle, and stepping in intimate conversation. At the heart lie Verch\u2019s delicate voice, energetic footwork, and stunning playing. Sometimes she sings, steps and fiddles all at once, with apparent ease and precision. Verch is -\u00ad\u2010 as they say -\u00ad\u2010 a triple threat in performance, her live show a beautiful companion to her music: versatile, robust, and masterfully executed.\n\nVerch began her full time touring career in 2000 and has performed around the world, including festival, theatre and performing arts centre appearances in Canada, USA, China, Australia, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, Spain, Czech Republic and the United Arab Emirates. She also presents workshops, master classes, and lectures as part of her tours and at selected music camps.\n\nVerch won\u2019t be the one to tell you about her championship titles, nominations, and awards, or the fact that she was one of 6 fiddlers who represented the Canadian fiddle tradition to the world at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, as part of a segment called \"Fiddle Nation\u201d.

Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

Performing five out of seven nights in any given week with dancers she calls The Divas, Big Freedia\u2019s show is nothing short of dazzling. She tours every city in America from New York to San Francisco and is always a favorite at festivals such as Electric Forest, Hangout Fest, FunFunFun Fest, SXSW, and Bonnaroo, among many others.\n\nGay and proud, Big Freedia asserts that her (Freedia is a he but uses the feminine pronoun for her stage persona) sexuality has little to do with her music. \"All types of people\u2014gay, straight, rich, poor, black, white come to my shows. People just wanna get out and shake their azzzz and have a good time!\u201d\n\nBig Freedia has gone from a local New Orleans phenomenon to a national one over the past two years. After appearing in two episodes of HBO series \u2018Treme\u2019 [as herself] and in 2010, she released her debut EP on Scion A/V Presents: Big Freedia, produced by NOLA producer BlaqNmilD. The EP featured notables \u201cExcuse\u201d and \u201cAlmost Famous; other fan-favorites include \u201cGin in my System\u201d \u201cAzz Everwhere\u201d and \u201cY\u2019all Get Back Now.\u201d Adding to her catalog, this year she released \u201cNah Who Mad\u201d and \u201cBooty Whop,\u201d and she was featured on Spank Rock\u2019s Everything is Boring and Everyone is a Fucking Liar LP, on the track \u201cNasty.\u201d\n\nThis January, Freedia made her television network debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live! She appeared on \u201cLast Call with Carson Daly,\u201d FADERTV, PITCHFORK TV and has been lauded in press outlets such as The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Fader, RollingStone.com, SPIN, OffBeat, Chicago Tribune, Columbia Spectator, Pheonix New Times, San Francisco Chronicle, LA Times, LA Weekly, among many other media outlets.\n\nAlways pushing artistic boundaries, this year Big Freedia went hi-tech by releasing the Big Freedia Booty Battle Video Game, which Forbes magazine covered, calling it \u201c\u2026everything a great game should be.\u201d\n\nRaised on Josephine Street in uptown New Orleans, Big Freedia, born Freddie Ross, was raised by his mother, a hairdresser, and stepfather, a truck driver for Coca-Cola. When Freddie was 15, the family moved to a more upscale neighborhood in New Orleans. Freddie\u2014along with his brother Adam and sister Crystal Ross\u2014were immersed in music at home by their mother, who often sang along to her Gladys Knight and Patty LaBelle records around the house. But it was the Baptist church choir where a young Freddie flourished. \u201dMy mother made sure I never missed practice,\u201d recalls Freedia. It\u2019s no wonder that by the time he was 18, Freedia moved from member to director of the choir.\n\nA product of the hip-hop generation, Freedia was rocking RUN DMC, Salt \u2018n Pepa and Adidas Shell Tops as a teenager. One night in 1991 he heard \"Where Dey At\" by MC T Tucker, (what many believe to be the first recorded Bounce track) and he was transfixed. After starting as a back-up dancer for Katey Red, the original \u201cSissy Bounce\u201d rapper, Freedia knew Bounce was his calling and eventually broke out on his own.\n\nBig Freedia is in the studio wrapping up her new ep Queen of Bounce and her first TV series, Queen of Bounce will air this Oct on Fuse TV. Finally, in the works is her DVD: Big Freedia Presents: Twerk Bounce & Pop, featuring real Bounce dance instruction from Big Freedia and some of her best and noted Divas.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/bigfreedia"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Roots LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8653218.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Hip Hop", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Roots, also known as The Legendary Roots Crew, The Square Roots and The Foundation, are an influential, Grammy winning hip hop group based out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, famed for a heavily jazzy sound and live instrumentation. Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

Since the 1970s, Lovano has been one of the world's premiere tenor saxophone players, earning a Grammy award and several nods on Down Beat magazine's critics' and readers' polls.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio, Lovano was exposed throughout his early life to jazz by his father, Tony \"Big T\" Lovano. John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, and Sonny Stitt were among his earlier influences. He developed further at Berklee College of Music, and then served a big band apprenticeship with Woody Herman's Thundering Herd and the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra.\n\n\"Big T\" Lovano, a fine Cleveland tenorman, was his first inspiration. He taught Joe all the standards, how to lead a gig, how to pace a set, and to be versatile enough to always find work. Joe started on alto at age six and switched to tenor five years later. He attended Berklee before working with Jack McDuff and Dr. Lonnie Smith. After three years with Woody Herman's Orchestra, Lovano moved to New York and began playing regularly with Mel Lewis\u2019 Big Band. This influence is still present in his solos. He often plays lines that convey the rhythmic drive and punch of an entire horn section.\n\nOne of the top saxophonists of the 1990s, Joe Lovano continues to grow and explore as a musician. He has a husky tenor tone based in the tradition, but an approach to improvisation that is modern and daring. In the early \u201880s he began working in John Scofield\u2019s Quartet and a bass-less trio with Paul Motian and Bill Frisell. Steeped in the tradition of Ornette Coleman, Motian\u2019s recordings show off Lovano\u2019s avant-garde abilities. Scofield\u2019s Quartet straddled the line between \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d. These recordings feature some of Lovano\u2019s best work.\n\nLovano has enduring musical partnerships with John Scofield and Paul Motian, having participated in some of their most noteworthy projects over the years.\n\nHe is currently a jazz artist on the international level. His live work, specifically Quarterts at the Village Vanguard, garnered a Down Beat \"Jazz Album of the Year\" award. Other releases include Trio Fascination and 52nd Street Themes.", "otherInfo": "Described by DownBeat magazine as \u201cthe titan among us,\u201d GRAMMY-winning saxophonist Joe Lovano is one of the era\u2019s definitive improvisers and bandleaders.

He has collaborated with a wide range of artists, filmmakers and legendary musicians. But it is his work as a leader that has garnered increasing attention and accolades. The New York Times described Frisell\u2019s music this way. \u201cIt's hard to find a more fruitful meditation on American music than in the compositions of guitarist Bill Frisell. Mixing rock and country with jazz and blues, he's found what connects them: improvisation and a sense of play. Unlike other pastichists, who tend to duck passion, Mr. Frisell plays up the pleasure in the music and also takes on another often-avoided subject, tenderness.\"\n\nFrisell\u2019s recordings over the last decades span a wide range of musical influences. His catalog, including over twenty recordings for Nonesuch, has been cited by Downbeat as \u201cthe best recorded output of the decade.\u201d It includes original Buster Keaton film scores to arrangements of music for extended ensemble with horns (This Land, Blues Dream); adaptations of his compositions originally written as sound-tracks to Gary Larson cartoons (Quartet); interpretations of work by other classic and contemporary American composers (Have a Little Faith) ; and collaborations with the acclaimed rhythm section of bassist Viktor Krauss and drummer Jim Keltner (Gone, Just Like a Train, Good Dog, Happy Man). Other releases include an album with Nashville musicians (Nashville), the solo album Ghost Town, an album of his arrangements of songs by Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach (The Sweetest Punch), a trio album with jazz legends Dave Holland and Elvin Jones, and a collection of American traditional songs and original compositions inspired by them entitled The Willies. The Intercontinentals, nominated for a Grammy in 2004 is an album that combines Frisell\u2019s own brand of American roots music and his unmistakable improvisational style with the influences of Brazilian, Greek, and Malian sounds. His 2004 release, entitled Unspeakable, produced by Hal Wilner, won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album. East/West is a two CD set, featuring his two working trios recorded in concert on both coasts. Bill Frisell, Ron Carter, Paul Motian features two jazz legends that Bill considers among his true mentors and musical inspirations. His collaborative project Floratone (Blue Note) with drummer Matt Chamberlain and producers Lee Townsend & Tucker Martine, was described by All About Jazz as \u201ca modern masterpiece.\u201d History, Mystery was nominated for a Grammy award in Best Instrumental Jazz category, featuring an octet of strings, horns and rhythm section with some of his closest music collaborators exploring a fuller palette of compositional colors and timbres than any he has previously written for. \u201cThe whole album stands as yet another testament to the man's place at the very epicenter of modern American music.\" - BBC. The recent collection titled The Best of Bill Frisell, Vol 1: Folk Songs is the first in a series of compilations, this one drawn from Frisell's catalog spotlighting his idiosyncratic excursions into country and traditional folk. His latest album, \u201cDisfarmer\u201d, was inspired by the photographer Mike Disfarmer. It was described by the Houston Chronicle as follows: \"Frisell's pacing is magnificent, and the album sweeps along with purpose like a gorgeous, spacious epic. It is full of sounds that suggest settings and characters, including the mysterious eccentric who inspired the recording.\"\n\nBeginning in 2008, a trilogy of Frisell\u2019s music DVD\u2019s was released. First was Solos, shot in Toronto in high definition. Following in 2009, were the long awaited Films of Buster Keaton, Music By Bill Frisell featuring Frisell\u2019s original trio, Kermit Driscoll on bass and Joey Baron on drums as well as Live From Montreal, shot at the Montreal Jazz Festival in 2002 and featuring Matt Chamberlain on drums, Billy Drewes on alto saxophone, Curtis Fowlkes on trombone, Ron Miles on cornet and Greg Leisz on steel guitars.

He has collaborated with a wide range of artists, filmmakers and legendary musicians. But it is his work as a leader that has garnered increasing attention and accolades. The New York Times described Frisell\u2019s music this way. \u201cIt's hard to find a more fruitful meditation on American music than in the compositions of guitarist Bill Frisell. Mixing rock and country with jazz and blues, he's found what connects them: improvisation and a sense of play. Unlike other pastichists, who tend to duck passion, Mr. Frisell plays up the pleasure in the music and also takes on another often-avoided subject, tenderness.\"\n\nFrisell\u2019s recordings over the last decades span a wide range of musical influences. His catalog, including over twenty recordings for Nonesuch, has been cited by Downbeat as \u201cthe best recorded output of the decade.\u201d It includes original Buster Keaton film scores to arrangements of music for extended ensemble with horns (This Land, Blues Dream); adaptations of his compositions originally written as sound-tracks to Gary Larson cartoons (Quartet); interpretations of work by other classic and contemporary American composers (Have a Little Faith) ; and collaborations with the acclaimed rhythm section of bassist Viktor Krauss and drummer Jim Keltner (Gone, Just Like a Train, Good Dog, Happy Man). Other releases include an album with Nashville musicians (Nashville), the solo album Ghost Town, an album of his arrangements of songs by Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach (The Sweetest Punch), a trio album with jazz legends Dave Holland and Elvin Jones, and a collection of American traditional songs and original compositions inspired by them entitled The Willies. The Intercontinentals, nominated for a Grammy in 2004 is an album that combines Frisell\u2019s own brand of American roots music and his unmistakable improvisational style with the influences of Brazilian, Greek, and Malian sounds. His 2004 release, entitled Unspeakable, produced by Hal Wilner, won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album. East/West is a two CD set, featuring his two working trios recorded in concert on both coasts. Bill Frisell, Ron Carter, Paul Motian features two jazz legends that Bill considers among his true mentors and musical inspirations. His collaborative project Floratone (Blue Note) with drummer Matt Chamberlain and producers Lee Townsend & Tucker Martine, was described by All About Jazz as \u201ca modern masterpiece.\u201d History, Mystery was nominated for a Grammy award in Best Instrumental Jazz category, featuring an octet of strings, horns and rhythm section with some of his closest music collaborators exploring a fuller palette of compositional colors and timbres than any he has previously written for. \u201cThe whole album stands as yet another testament to the man's place at the very epicenter of modern American music.\" - BBC. The recent collection titled The Best of Bill Frisell, Vol 1: Folk Songs is the first in a series of compilations, this one drawn from Frisell's catalog spotlighting his idiosyncratic excursions into country and traditional folk. His latest album, \u201cDisfarmer\u201d, was inspired by the photographer Mike Disfarmer. It was described by the Houston Chronicle as follows: \"Frisell's pacing is magnificent, and the album sweeps along with purpose like a gorgeous, spacious epic. It is full of sounds that suggest settings and characters, including the mysterious eccentric who inspired the recording.\"\n\nBeginning in 2008, a trilogy of Frisell\u2019s music DVD\u2019s was released. First was Solos, shot in Toronto in high definition. Following in 2009, were the long awaited Films of Buster Keaton, Music By Bill Frisell featuring Frisell\u2019s original trio, Kermit Driscoll on bass and Joey Baron on drums as well as Live From Montreal, shot at the Montreal Jazz Festival in 2002 and featuring Matt Chamberlain on drums, Billy Drewes on alto saxophone, Curtis Fowlkes on trombone, Ron Miles on cornet and Greg Leisz on steel guitars. It showcases the music of Frisell\u2019s celebrated album, Blues Dream.\n\nIn 2006, Frisell was named a USA Rasmuson Fellow and became a recipient of a grant offered by United States Artists, a privately funded organization dedicated to the support of America's finest living artists.", "otherInfo": "On Friday, May 8th 5-6PM PT, SFJAZZ will be streaming GRAMMY Award-winning Joe Lovano's 2019 trios concert featuring two of his most adventurous groups including Trio Fascination w/ Bill Frisell & Tyshawn Sorey, and Trio Tapestry w/ Marilyn Crispell & Carmen Castaldi"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Patrick Fleming Music LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10284446.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Rock Americana", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Welcome to Patrick Fleming Music, a place for all things PF MUSIC: PF Solo, PF Band, PF Originals...

It is a pure country voice through and through. Blessed with a Johnny Cash baritone and the wit of Jerry Reed, Ray displays both over the 11 songs on his fourth album, the self-titled Ray Scott. A mix of roadhouse foot-stompers, stone-cold country ballads and the sing-speak songs for which he\u2019s become known, Ray Scott flashes with the energy and verve that defined Ray\u2019s earlier hits \u201cMy Kind of Music\u201d and \u201cThose Jeans.\u201d\nBut the album is also a reintroduction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reboot\u2014or a Ray-boot, if you will,\u201d quips Ray, who dubbed his last album Rayality. \u201cIt is an evolution, but I think people will hear it and know it\u2019s the same guy from \u2018My Kind of Music\u2019 and \u2018Those Jeans.\u2019 Lyrically, I tend to say things a certain way. You can always tell it\u2019s me.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s good reason for that, aside from that rumbling voice. Save for a few trusted cowriters here and there, like Mark Stephen Jones, Tony Mullins and Brandy Clark, Ray prefers to write solo. In this era of five-plus writers collaborating on a single song, Ray is a true lone wolf.\n\u201cCollaboration is fun and some of my favorite things have been written with other people, but at the same time, if you can write by yourself, you should,\u201d Ray says. \u201cThere was a time in Nashville when people wrote alone. Some of my favorite old writers, the people who got me interested in doing this in the first place\u2014Harlan Howard and Bob McDill\u2014wrote alone.\u201d\nThe results of such a writing style are pure, unfiltered songs, the undiluted vision of the artist.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always recorded my own material because it\u2019s almost impossible for me to sell a song that someone else wrote. I was more or less made to tell stories through my own window\u2014and the window\u2019s pretty smudged sometimes,\u201d Ray laughs. \u201cBut if I can entertain myself, I feel like other people might be entertained as well.\u201d\nThe tracks on Ray Scott are certainly entertaining. These are story songs that, instead of just repeating a catch phrase over and over, actually go somewhere. \u201cPapa n Mama,\u201d a loping blues number, is the tale of a son who stops his father\u2014 permanently\u2014from abusing his mother, landing himself in the pen. \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Gonna Be You\u201d is a defiant kiss-off to a cheating lover, promising she\u2019ll never break this guy\u2019s heart again. The cinematic \u201cLeave This World,\u201d however, is the polar opposite: a love song of devotion elevated by Ray\u2019s Male Vocalist of the Year-worthy performance, proof that Ray\u2019s bread and butter isn\u2019t just in the spoken word.\nStill, there is magic in those recitation numbers, especially in \u201cTijuana Buzzkill.\u201d A true tale of a disastrous, if humorous, south-of-the-border adventure that ended with Ray and his buddy in jail, the track exemplifies Ray\u2019s gift for wry storytelling.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just as much an art to recitation as there is singing. It\u2019s all in how you emote, your emphasis and how you tell a story,\u201d he says. And it helps if you have comic timing, which Ray does in spades. In songs like the hazy bonus track \u201cWhat Works for Willie\u201d and the take-one-for-the-team anthem \u201cThe Ugly One,\u201d he delivers the pay-off lines with the cadence of a comedian.\n\u201cThe songs end up being a little on the polarizing side,\u201d Ray admits. \u201cBut I love that. Everything I\u2019ve ever had any luck with was a song that made people turn their head and go, \u2018Well, that\u2019s different\u2019 or \u2018That pisses me off.\u2019\u201d\nProduced by Dave Brainard (Brandy Clark\u2019s 12 Stories, Jerrod Niemann\u2019s Free the Music), Ray Scott excels in the details\u2014the swampy harmonica of lead-off track \u201cCookin\u2019\u201d; the mariachi horns of \u201cTijuana Buzzkill\u201d; and the hypnotic rhythm of the white-trash nursery rhyme \u201cWheels on the House.\u201d In the end, no two songs sound alike, and Ray cements himself as a deft performer, able to toggle between those funny tunes and serious fare like the staggering \u201cI Miss the Days.\u201d\nA bittersweet ballad about being young, \u201cI Miss the Days\u201d is a slice of nostalgia, both in subject matter and production. Sonically, it recalls the 1970s and \u201980s sound of country music.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we were going for. If you listen to an old Waylon Jennings record or something from that time period, a lot of those songs had a \u2018Luckenbach\u2019 vibe to them,\u201d says Ray, who agrees that today\u2019s country music frequently borrows some of the bombast of late \u201980s hard rock. \u201cBut I\u2019m a little more Waylon and a little less Warrant.\u201d\nIn the end, Ray Scott furthers Ray\u2019s identity as a modern day outlaw, not in image, but in his approach to the music industry.\n\u201cAfter all these years in Nashville I\u2019ve never been willing to compromise my artistic vision as far as writing goes or the way things are recorded and produced. I don\u2019t chase trends, which is not necessarily your quickest road to riches by any means,\u201d he says.\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, I\u2019d like to walk outside my trailer, look up at the sun and say, \u2018I did it the way I wanted.\u2019\u201d Ray stops to laugh. \u201cWhen the cops come to serve the warrant, at least I\u2019ll have my integrity\u2014integrity and a beer.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Yall join us for another mancave Jam this Friday on the Official Ray Scott Facebook page at 7:30PM cst!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Spencer Ludwig LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9994334.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Indie Pop, Pop, Indie, Alternative, Soulful Funky Pop, Indie Dance, Jazz", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Since being the original trumpeter in the multi-platinum band Capital Cities (2012 \u2013 2015), the Los Angeles-born, half-Filipino vocalist-instrumentalist has gone rogue, adding a new dimension of possibility to not only his sonic weapon of choice, but also to pop music.

She was raised surrounded by living, breathing roots music\u2014her father\u2019s country band rehearsing; the lively music at church and at community dances; the tunes she rocked out to win fiddle competitions. She thought every little girl learned to stepdance at the age of three and fiddle at the age of six. She knew nothing else and decided early on that she wanted to be a professional musician.\n\nShe took that leap, and for over two decades has been recording and captivating audiences worldwide, exploring new and nuanced places each step of the way. On April 12, 2019, Verch will release her twelfth recording, Once A Day, via Slab Town Records. A followup to her 2017 career-\u00ad\u2010 spanning release The April Verch Anthology, this new album is a heartfelt homage to 1950s and 60s classic country.\n\nRecorded in Nashville by Bil VornDick and produced by Doug Cox, Once A Day features the talents of country veterans including steel guitarist Al Perkins (Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris), guitarist Redd Volkaert (Merle Haggard) and fiddler Kenny Sears (Mel Tillis, Grand Ole Opry). From the title track, a hit debut single for Connie Smith, to Loretta Lynn\u2019s \u201cYou Ain\u2019t Woman Enough,\u201d and Webb Pierce\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re Not Mine Anymore,\u201d the album is a dynamic crash course in one of Country Music\u2019s most influential time periods. Her admiration for these musicians and this iconic era is evident from start to finish. Void of contemporary gimmicks and over-\u00ad\u2010production, Verch revels in the history and lets the music speak for itself.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, making this album was not a choice. It was something I felt I had to do. It has been more daunting than any other project I\u2019ve embarked on, because these songs, these artists, the history of this music matters to me on the deepest level. It is a love letter and a thank you letter in one, to the artists, songwriters, musicians, and industry professionals who created, perhaps in some cases without even realizing it, an era of music that speaks to me in a way that no other music does. If someone hears a song on this album and that prompts them to look up and love the original that will be the highest compliment I could receive,\u201d explains Verch.\n\nWhile Verch is perhaps best known for playing traditional fiddle styles from her native Ottawa Valley, Canada, her performances extend into old-\u00ad\u2010time American and Appalachian styles and far beyond, for a well-\u00ad\u2010rounded tour-\u00ad\u2010de-\u00ad\u2010force of North Americana sounds. Verch and her fellow trio members pare down their arrangements, highlighting the simple pleasures of upright bass, guitar, clawhammer banjo, voices, fiddle, and stepping in intimate conversation. At the heart lie Verch\u2019s delicate voice, energetic footwork, and stunning playing. Sometimes she sings, steps and fiddles all at once, with apparent ease and precision. Verch is -\u00ad\u2010 as they say -\u00ad\u2010 a triple threat in performance, her live show a beautiful companion to her music: versatile, robust, and masterfully executed.\n\nVerch began her full time touring career in 2000 and has performed around the world, including festival, theatre and performing arts centre appearances in Canada, USA, China, Australia, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, Spain, Czech Republic and the United Arab Emirates. She also presents workshops, master classes, and lectures as part of her tours and at selected music camps.\n\nVerch won\u2019t be the one to tell you about her championship titles, nominations, and awards, or the fact that she was one of 6 fiddlers who represented the Canadian fiddle tradition to the world at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, as part of a segment called \"Fiddle Nation\u201d. Instead, in speaking with her, you\u2019ll hear about how passionate she is about sharing her music; in small gatherings in remote communities in Iqaluit, to large prestigious concert halls like Mozartsal in Vienna.\n\nEven as she plays with the tradition she inherited, Verch keeps the community-\u00ad\u2010fired celebratory side of her music at the forefront, honing a keen awareness of how to engage contemporary listeners. It\u2019s why Rolling Stone cited her \u201cOne of the 12 best things we saw at MerleFest in 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as contemporary bluegrass has Alison Krauss as an ambassador, the Ottawa Valley has April Verch,\u201d said NPR\u2019s Marco Werman on \u201cThe World.\u201d And Verch never forgets the roots of her music, that connection to the people out there in the audience, on the dance floor, to the community sparked by a good song. \u201cIt\u2019s about joining together to celebrate everyday life, through music. We\u2019re all in this together.\u201d Verch\u2019s ability to preserve the authentic folk traditions of the past and reintroduce them into the musical landscape of the present is a testament to her masterful musicianship and widespread appeal.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anthony D'Amato LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9501754.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Rock, Acoustic, Indie, Americana, Folk", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Produced by Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes, First Aid Kit) and recorded with contributions from an Omaha all-star team including Conor Oberst and members of Bright Eyes, The Faint, and Cursive, 'Cold Snap' is Anthony D'Amato's most ambitious record yet.

Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

He\u2019s played four hour shows single-handedly, and traded half-hour sets at a weekly house gig at a bar in Guatemala City with \u201csome guy named Luis, who sang songs like \u2018My Way\u2019 in Spanish. The pay was 15 quetzales and all the Gallo beer I could drink,\u201d according to Jim.\n\nAlong the way Jim has written songs for and appeared on Madison Square Garden TV\u2019s \u201cYankee Ticket\u201d pregame show, and Fox Sports Net\u2019s Minnesota Twins pregame show. Jim\u2019s music caught the attention of the Twins, and Jim\u2019s song Circle Me Bert was featured by the Twins in a 10,000 CD giveaway to fans attending a game. He has also written the music for a fishing show, and children\u2019s music for an up-coming educational video.\n\nJim\u2019s latest realease is entitled Into The Blue. It\u2019s rock/pop sprinkled with a bit of folk/country/jazz and garnished with a pinch of reggae on the side and served with a smile on the seriously humorous side of town. With song topics ranging from politics and religion (\u201cgod\u201d) to life as a dog (\u201cRoxygrrl\u201d), Into The Blue covers a lot of ground. Life, death, love, politics and religion--it's all in there.\n\nA true independent musician, Jim released Into The Blue on his own label, Door To Door Music, as he did with his previous releases, All Dressed Up And All Stressed Out (1996), Knives & Bleeding (1999). and Hello Hello (2002). Each release features songwriting that bears the mark of a variety of influences such as Lennon & McCartney, Bob Marley, Elvis Costello, Squeeze, even Hank Williams. A fan on Jim\u2019s CDBaby page summed it up this way:\n\u201cJim plays because he loves music. He plays with the same passion whether he is playing for thousands or a few fans. It is clear in every track that Jim is playing for his love of music and not just for all the hoopla.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

Freddie\u2014along with his brother Adam and sister Crystal Ross\u2014were immersed in music at home by their mother, who often sang along to her Gladys Knight and Patty LaBelle records around the house.

There she performed solo with, \u201cThe Blonde\u201d, her semi-hollow body electric guitar, and was often joined by the raucous, three part call-and-answer trio, The Dirty Girls! She released her first solo CD titled \u2018Simple\u2019 in May of 2008. The group was invited to the famous Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, TN. as the feature for The Sunday \u2018Songwriter\u2019s Spotlight\u2019. \u2018Simple\u2018 can be heard in regular rotation on KOOP, KAZI ;Austin, TX., WWOZ; New Orleans, LA. and various radio in Europe as well as making it on to 2 Top 5 Euro-Americana Charts.\n\".. her (LisaMarshall) voice belts and soars through the building lyrics then dips to a restrained contralto for climatic lines. Hints of reverb in the production space add a subtle, creepy effect to the gospel tunes. It could almost be too crafted, but with Marshall's spellbinding voice pulling at the tempo, the album feels so organic that you can't imagine it any other way.\"- Rachel Dovey, Seattle Sound Magazine\nMarshall's debut solo album 'Simple' was a one woman project with Lisa recording, mixing and playing every instrument on the album except Track 1 & 3; Scotty X on Bass, Track 6; E. Pruitt on Bass, Track 3 & 4; Eric Manegold on Drums, Track 2 & 5; Kevin Fallon on Lead Guitar, Track 5; Nick Salzetti on Drums. The title track Simple drums were recorded with a single sennheiser dynamic microphone placed in the middle of the drum set above the kick drum.\n\nBorn and raised in Virginia Beach, VA, she spent her early years on the Chesapeake Bay. Her young parents possessed a large vinyl collection; Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, Motown, Funk to Disco, was a constant in the house. Lisa remembers hours of sitting on the sand filled carpet with the album insert of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young 4 Way Street, reading the lyrics and singing along to 'Cowgirl In The Sand' with her younger sister. \"I have always loved harmonies. I loved that album for their harmonies. Looking back it's so fitting that I would sing that song. Living literally across the street from the beach our carpet sounded like a giant bean bag when you walked on it. I guess I thought I was the cowgirl.\" (laughs)...more like a gypsy\"\n\nAt the age of 21, Marshall moved to California. It was in L.A. where she co-founded and fronted Peculiar Boogie with Rebekah Coltman (guitar) & Susan Joyner (keys) for a decade. Their band was a unique blend of female fronted \u201cBrit\u201d Rock featuring R&B style vocals and harmonies. The band played and showcased at some of L.A\u2019s hot spots such as Troubadour, and the Roxy. Robben Ford, Koko Taylor, and Big Brother and the Holding Company are some of the acts that Peculiar Boogie supported. The band received air play in California and Europe regularly. Lisa also had the honor of singing with Big Brother and the Holding Company.\n\nCurrently Lisa had been debuting new songs with her band live around Austin. She continues to create new music for an upcoming EP to be released in 2016. Lisa has been selected from over 900 musicians in Austin to the list of Black Fret/Patrons of Live Music. Her love affair with early Soul/Funk/R&B continues as she honors the broad scope of the delicious sounds. From Betty Wright, Aretha Franklin, Issac Hayes, Curtis Mayfield, The Staple Singers and more...her own truth is in her songs.

In 1964, she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College and in 1968 she founded The House, a company dedicated to an interdisciplinary approach to performance. Her performances influenced many artists, including Bruce Nauman, whom she met in San Francisco in 1968. In 1978 Monk formed the ensemble called Meredith Monk and Vocal Ensemble (modelled after similar ensembles of musical collagues such as Steve Reich and Philip Glass) to explore new and wider vocal textures and forms which often were contrasted with minimal instrumental textures. Powerful and influential pieces from this time include Dolmen Music (1979), which also was recorded for her first album released at Manfred Eicher's record label ECM in 1981. In the 1980s she wrote and directed two films, Ellis Island (1981), and Book of Days (1988), which developed from a single idea; \"One day during summer of 1984, as I was sweeping the floor of my house in the country, the image of a young girl (in black and white) and a medieval street in the Jewish community (also in black and white) came to me\", as Monk recounts in the liner notes of the ECM-recording. Apart from the film, different versions exist of this piece: two for the concert hall, and an album, explained by Meredith Monk and Manfred Eicher as \"a film for the ears.\" In the early 1990s Monk composed an opera - Atlas which premiered in Houston in 1991. More recently, while continuing her work for her ensemble, she began writing for instrumental ensembles and symphony orchestra - her first symphonic work, Possible Sky (2003), and Stringsongs (2004), commissioned by the Kronos Quartet. In 2005, events were held all over the world celebrating the 40th anniversary of her career. These included a concert in Carnegie Hall, featuring Bj\u00f6rk, whose singing is fundamentally indebted to Monk's, and others, including the composers Terry Riley, DJ Spooky (who has sampled her on his album \"Drums of Death\"), and John Zorn and the new music ensembles Alarm Will Sound and Bang on a Can All-Stars, along with the Pacific Mozart Ensemble.\n\n\nShe has won many awards including a MacArthur Fellowship, and she holds honorary Doctor of Arts degrees from Bard College, the University of the Arts (Philadelphia), The Julliard School, the San Francisco Art Institute and the Boston Conservatory.\n\nHer music was used in films by Joel and Ethan Coen (The Big Lebowski, 1998) and Jean-Luc Godard (Nouvelle Vague, 1990 and Notre musique, 2004).\n\nIn a recent interview she said that her favourite music includes Brazilian music, especially Caetano Veloso's recordings, the music by Mildred Bailey (\"the great jazz singer from the \u201830s and \u201840s\"), and Bartok's cycle for piano Mikrokosmos.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/virtuallemonaid"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "VNSSA ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9059080.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Acid House, House, Techno, Tech House, Bass House", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "VNSSA has always had a passion for music, even as a child.

For over 3 decades he has elevated and shaped an entire genre and remains one of the leading forces in the global music scene today.\n\nHis most recent works have taken him from the DJ booth of the worlds hottest nightspots and festivals to the studio producing soundtracks for Hollywood blockbuster movies. His diversity in artistry and ability has earned him accolades from critics and fans alike. Garnering him not 1 but 2 Grammy Nominations for his works.\n\nBut lets take a step back. The son of a musician, Paul came up as a young DJ in the late '70s spinning Funk in Covent Garden. Not what some might have expected from one of Trances preeminent masters. But he knew then music would be his life. In the '80s 2 life-changing trips took place. The first in 1984 where he spent several months living in New York City working as A&R man for the famed Champion Records signing DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, as well as Salt-n-Pepa. He also became promoter and British agent for the Beastie Boys and Run-D.M.C.\n\nThe second trip and more contemporary influence was in 1987 which brought Paul to the White Isle of Ibiza. Here he discovered the Balearic sound that flowed through the Ibiza air at clubs such as Amnesia. Inspired, he took the music and experiences back to the UK and became its ambassador. Paul returned often holding residencies at Amnesia and Pacha in Ibiza. Around the same time Ministry Of Sound in London was opening and tauted Paul as their first resident. However it was his famed residency at UK super-club Cream in Liverpool that brought Paul global respect as a master of his art. It was some say the catalyst to what has made him a touring legend.\n\nThis residency was celebrated through the Grammy nominated 2004 compilation \u2018Creamfields\u2019 (Paul went on to receive a second Grammy nomination in 2007 with his artist album, \u201cA Lively Mind\u201d and then again in 2009 for his production work with Madonna).\n\nOakenfold\u2019s stature as a DJ and entertainer has taken him beyond the normal club and festival circuit, playing landmark gigs that have changed the face of electronic music. Highlights include three worldwide tours warming up for Madonna and U2 (with both artists insisting on a DJ set from Paul instead of a support band); performing physically on the Great Wall of China and two sold out dates playing to 30,000 people at the Hollywood Bowl in California.\n\nA year after that first visit to Ibiza, Perfecto was born. Founded in 1988, Oakenfold\u2019s groundbreaking Perfecto record label played an integral role in the birth of trance music, with Paul at the helm producing massive international hits such as \u201cNot Over Yet\u201d, \u201cBullet In The Gun\u201d and \u201cSouthern Sun\u201d. With countless high profile releases and remixes in its path, Perfecto Records is still the benchmark to which so many labels measure themselves. 20+ years later, Perfecto remains as cutting edge and popular as ever, even resurrecting its Perfecto Fluoro sublabel in 2011. Probably Perfecto\u2019s most notable release was the recent double album \u201cPerfecto Las Vegas\u201d which held the #1 spot on the US iTunes dance chart for several weeks. This release solidified Paul\u2019s stronghold as an International DJ power player achieving the highest selling DJ compilation ever released in US history \u2013 with over half a million sales.\n\nPaul has produced for megastars such as U2, Madonna (including her latest release \u201cCelebration\u201d) and The Happy Mondays. As well as three acclaimed artist albums under his own name. He has remixed Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones and Justin Timberlake and released over 20 DJ mix compilations. In recent years Paul has also been responsible for creating some of the most breathtaking film scores and cues for a long list of Hollywood blockbusters \u2013 including The Bourne Identity, Matrix Reloaded, Shrek 2, Swordfish and Collateral. But his most anticipated release is yet to come. Paul Oakenfold\u2019s newest artist album \u2018Pop Killer\u2019 is scheduled for imminent release featuring The Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Gnarls Barkley, OneRepublic and B.O.B.\n\nAstonishingly, despite all his success in the worlds of chart music and film, Oakenfold has found time to keep in touch with his roots as a club DJ.

Raised in a small town in the heart of Sonoma County, by a Portuguese and Irish father and Filipina, German, Spanish mother, Emme was taught that the only successes in life, stemmed from a classroom. \"Call my parents old school.\" She says. \"They didn\u2019t believe dreams were actually tangible, or something you do for a living.\" Ironically enough, it was at school, where she would find her escape. In the middle of science class, Emme was talking about one of her favorite songs, \"My Love is Your Love\", by Whitney Houston. A fellow student couldn\u2019t remember how it went, so Emme sang a few lines to help, assuming it was standard fare. But those who listened were shocked, and told her, \"whoa! You sound just like the radio!\" Emme started to realize there was something vastly different in her voice. More and more, she would sneak away, behind the classroom doors, behind the gym or on the blacktop to perform for her friends. One time, it caused such a scene, the school's administration rushed over to break up a fight. After clearing through the crowd, what they found instead was a little girl with a big voice. That same day, Emme was invited to sing at the school's music assembly later that month. While holding the microphone in her hands for this first time, she realized her calling. Her friends began requesting more songs and mini performances, but it wasn't until they had her upload a video online, where things began to take off. Emme was discovered on YouTube and began working on her first album in 2011. A fan of diverse artists as Lauryn Hill, Michael Jackson, Etta James, Stevie Wonder, and Amy Winehouse, Emme is a unique blend of toughness, elegance, soulfulness, and swagger. Capable of rapping with conviction, singing with soul, writing with heart, and making records with an ear for gritty intangibles, she blends the old and new, making records that breathe life, while nourishing mainstream pop radio. Bridging the worlds of pop, hip hop, rock, R&B, and doo wop, Emme sets out to make a loud and clear statement. Young, confident, and fearless, honing her craft with wisdom, passion and conviction, Emme is an artist who seeks out to conquer. And her career has only just begun....follow her on her journey!

In 1964, she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College and in 1968 she founded The House, a company dedicated to an interdisciplinary approach to performance. Her performances influenced many artists, including Bruce Nauman, whom she met in San Francisco in 1968. In 1978 Monk formed the ensemble called Meredith Monk and Vocal Ensemble (modelled after similar ensembles of musical collagues such as Steve Reich and Philip Glass) to explore new and wider vocal textures and forms which often were contrasted with minimal instrumental textures. Powerful and influential pieces from this time include Dolmen Music (1979), which also was recorded for her first album released at Manfred Eicher's record label ECM in 1981. In the 1980s she wrote and directed two films, Ellis Island (1981), and Book of Days (1988), which developed from a single idea; \"One day during summer of 1984, as I was sweeping the floor of my house in the country, the image of a young girl (in black and white) and a medieval street in the Jewish community (also in black and white) came to me\", as Monk recounts in the liner notes of the ECM-recording. Apart from the film, different versions exist of this piece: two for the concert hall, and an album, explained by Meredith Monk and Manfred Eicher as \"a film for the ears.\" In the early 1990s Monk composed an opera - Atlas which premiered in Houston in 1991. More recently, while continuing her work for her ensemble, she began writing for instrumental ensembles and symphony orchestra - her first symphonic work, Possible Sky (2003), and Stringsongs (2004), commissioned by the Kronos Quartet. In 2005, events were held all over the world celebrating the 40th anniversary of her career. These included a concert in Carnegie Hall, featuring Bj\u00f6rk, whose singing is fundamentally indebted to Monk's, and others, including the composers Terry Riley, DJ Spooky (who has sampled her on his album \"Drums of Death\"), and John Zorn and the new music ensembles Alarm Will Sound and Bang on a Can All-Stars, along with the Pacific Mozart Ensemble.\n\n\nShe has won many awards including a MacArthur Fellowship, and she holds honorary Doctor of Arts degrees from Bard College, the University of the Arts (Philadelphia), The Julliard School, the San Francisco Art Institute and the Boston Conservatory.\n\nHer music was used in films by Joel and Ethan Coen (The Big Lebowski, 1998) and Jean-Luc Godard (Nouvelle Vague, 1990 and Notre musique, 2004).\n\nIn a recent interview she said that her favourite music includes Brazilian music, especially Caetano Veloso's recordings, the music by Mildred Bailey (\"the great jazz singer from the \u201830s and \u201840s\"), and Bartok's cycle for piano Mikrokosmos.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/virtuallemonaid"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Meesha Shafi ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:10 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/urgntmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "K Prouty ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10097989.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Metal, Prog Metal, Prog-rock, Progressive Alternative, Instrumental", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Progressive instrumental metal.\nK Prouty sound architect, guitar virtuoso, started as a singer front man and played guitar only as a means to convey and write songs.

Some call them \u201cthe DJ\u2019s DJ,\u201d and C-SIK is one of them.\n\nAfter starting his career as a turntablist battling in such competitions as the DMCs, over the last 10 years C-SIK has become one of Canada\u2019s most versatile DJ\u2019s. He began playing in clubs in 2007 and since then has become known for the undeniable style he brings to his sets, regardless if he\u2019s rocking an intimate basement jam or for a crowd of thousands. His crowd-reading ability and taste-making selections have brought him around the world to DJ in Toronto, San Francisco, Jersey City, Honolulu and everywhere in between. His competitive roots also led him to enter the Red Bull 3Style, where he won the Canadian title in 2014, going on to represent his country on the world stage in Azerbaijan.\n\nCloser to home he\u2019s been holding down coveted residencies at some of Calgary\u2019s best venues including Hifi Club and Untitled Lounge; and also co-founded one of the city\u2019s most successful old-school hip-hop and R&B parties, Rewind (which has consistently sold out its 1000+ person venue for eight years running). He\u2019s also passionate about sharing his love for his craft with the new generation, and since 2013 has been heading up the DJ program at Beat Drop, Calgary\u2019s first DJ and production school. He is also one of the founding members of Skratcher\u2019s Calgary chapter.\n\nWhether he\u2019s dropping a guest mix on Sway In The Morning, playing alongside De La Soul\u2019s Maseo or directly supporting Diplo; whether he\u2019s cuttin\u2019 it up to some classics or dropping the latest heaters\u2014C-SIK does it all with flavour and finesse.

For over 3 decades he has elevated and shaped an entire genre and remains one of the leading forces in the global music scene today.\n\nHis most recent works have taken him from the DJ booth of the worlds hottest nightspots and festivals to the studio producing soundtracks for Hollywood blockbuster movies. His diversity in artistry and ability has earned him accolades from critics and fans alike. Garnering him not 1 but 2 Grammy Nominations for his works.\n\nBut lets take a step back. The son of a musician, Paul came up as a young DJ in the late '70s spinning Funk in Covent Garden. Not what some might have expected from one of Trances preeminent masters. But he knew then music would be his life. In the '80s 2 life-changing trips took place. The first in 1984 where he spent several months living in New York City working as A&R man for the famed Champion Records signing DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, as well as Salt-n-Pepa. He also became promoter and British agent for the Beastie Boys and Run-D.M.C.\n\nThe second trip and more contemporary influence was in 1987 which brought Paul to the White Isle of Ibiza. Here he discovered the Balearic sound that flowed through the Ibiza air at clubs such as Amnesia. Inspired, he took the music and experiences back to the UK and became its ambassador. Paul returned often holding residencies at Amnesia and Pacha in Ibiza. Around the same time Ministry Of Sound in London was opening and tauted Paul as their first resident. However it was his famed residency at UK super-club Cream in Liverpool that brought Paul global respect as a master of his art. It was some say the catalyst to what has made him a touring legend.\n\nThis residency was celebrated through the Grammy nominated 2004 compilation \u2018Creamfields\u2019 (Paul went on to receive a second Grammy nomination in 2007 with his artist album, \u201cA Lively Mind\u201d and then again in 2009 for his production work with Madonna).\n\nOakenfold\u2019s stature as a DJ and entertainer has taken him beyond the normal club and festival circuit, playing landmark gigs that have changed the face of electronic music. Highlights include three worldwide tours warming up for Madonna and U2 (with both artists insisting on a DJ set from Paul instead of a support band); performing physically on the Great Wall of China and two sold out dates playing to 30,000 people at the Hollywood Bowl in California.\n\nA year after that first visit to Ibiza, Perfecto was born. Founded in 1988, Oakenfold\u2019s groundbreaking Perfecto record label played an integral role in the birth of trance music, with Paul at the helm producing massive international hits such as \u201cNot Over Yet\u201d, \u201cBullet In The Gun\u201d and \u201cSouthern Sun\u201d. With countless high profile releases and remixes in its path, Perfecto Records is still the benchmark to which so many labels measure themselves. 20+ years later, Perfecto remains as cutting edge and popular as ever, even resurrecting its Perfecto Fluoro sublabel in 2011. Probably Perfecto\u2019s most notable release was the recent double album \u201cPerfecto Las Vegas\u201d which held the #1 spot on the US iTunes dance chart for several weeks. This release solidified Paul\u2019s stronghold as an International DJ power player achieving the highest selling DJ compilation ever released in US history \u2013 with over half a million sales.\n\nPaul has produced for megastars such as U2, Madonna (including her latest release \u201cCelebration\u201d) and The Happy Mondays. As well as three acclaimed artist albums under his own name. He has remixed Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones and Justin Timberlake and released over 20 DJ mix compilations. In recent years Paul has also been responsible for creating some of the most breathtaking film scores and cues for a long list of Hollywood blockbusters \u2013 including The Bourne Identity, Matrix Reloaded, Shrek 2, Swordfish and Collateral. But his most anticipated release is yet to come. Paul Oakenfold\u2019s newest artist album \u2018Pop Killer\u2019 is scheduled for imminent release featuring The Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Gnarls Barkley, OneRepublic and B.O.B.\n\nAstonishingly, despite all his success in the worlds of chart music and film, Oakenfold has found time to keep in touch with his roots as a club DJ. Over the past 3 years he has held a weekly residency at the legendary Rain nightclub in The Palms, Las Vegas. Planet Perfecto is a fully produced show with 75 circus performers, cutting edge visuals and special effects - giving the 3,000-strong crowd a truly unique experience.\n\nWhether you are listening to a CD, watching a commercial, going to a club or playing a video game; Paul\u2019s omnimedia presence is felt everywhere.

Jason\u2019s songs are always larger than life, and \u201cI Will Be There\u201d is no exception. Early 2014 saw Jason\u2019s true beginning when \u201cBurma\u201d was released, landing him squarely on the radar of the Anjunabeats A&R team and Above & Beyond, who played the track in their weekly Group Therapy Radio show (ABGT). The next week, listeners of ABGT voted \u201cBurma\u201d to be played again as Record of the Week, and then again for the following week\u2019s show. It would be an understatement to say it\u2019s rare for a non-Anjunabeats track to be played in three consecutive episodes of the radio show. For perspective, it\u2019s happened less than 5 times in nearly 600 total episodes going back to 2004. Jason signed to Anjunabeats soon after. His tracks have proven to be bona fide dance floor gold, blasting through sound systems at Madison Square Garden, the EDC Vegas Main Stage, and countless other venues. Above & Beyond and many others continue to see massive crowds surge with excitement whenever they drop a Jason Ross track. The balance of powerful emotion and electrifying energy created in his productions is proving to be a perfect yin and yang, earning him the \u201cfuture face of trance\u201d crown by Electric Daisy Carnival creators Insomniac. Since \u201cBurma\u201d he has released a sequence of galvanizing tunes on the label, including \u201cElements,\u201d \u201cCairo,\u201d and his collaboration with Wrechiski, \u201cAtlas,\u201d which quickly shot up to the #1 spot on the Beatport Trance chart.

Jason\u2019s first vocal single, \u201cMe Tonight\u201d featuring Lauren Ray, shot up the Beatport charts to become his second Beatport Trance #1. As the lead single off of the \u2018Anjunabeats Worldwide 06\u2019 compilation, curated and mixed by Jason himself, \u201cMe Tonight\u201d set the tone for an exhilarating, forward-thinking musical journey of Anjunabeats\u2019 exclusives. The compilation is highlighted by six of Jason\u2019s own originals, remixes and collaborations, including two new tracks alongside labelmate ilan Bluestone and a stellar remix of Seven Lion\u2019s hit \u201cCreation.\u201d The compilation charted in the Top 5 of iTunes Dance Albums in seven major markets, including Australia, India, and the United States.

In 1964, she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College and in 1968 she founded The House, a company dedicated to an interdisciplinary approach to performance. Her performances influenced many artists, including Bruce Nauman, whom she met in San Francisco in 1968. In 1978 Monk formed the ensemble called Meredith Monk and Vocal Ensemble (modelled after similar ensembles of musical collagues such as Steve Reich and Philip Glass) to explore new and wider vocal textures and forms which often were contrasted with minimal instrumental textures. Powerful and influential pieces from this time include Dolmen Music (1979), which also was recorded for her first album released at Manfred Eicher's record label ECM in 1981. In the 1980s she wrote and directed two films, Ellis Island (1981), and Book of Days (1988), which developed from a single idea; \"One day during summer of 1984, as I was sweeping the floor of my house in the country, the image of a young girl (in black and white) and a medieval street in the Jewish community (also in black and white) came to me\", as Monk recounts in the liner notes of the ECM-recording. Apart from the film, different versions exist of this piece: two for the concert hall, and an album, explained by Meredith Monk and Manfred Eicher as \"a film for the ears.\" In the early 1990s Monk composed an opera - Atlas which premiered in Houston in 1991. More recently, while continuing her work for her ensemble, she began writing for instrumental ensembles and symphony orchestra - her first symphonic work, Possible Sky (2003), and Stringsongs (2004), commissioned by the Kronos Quartet. In 2005, events were held all over the world celebrating the 40th anniversary of her career. These included a concert in Carnegie Hall, featuring Bj\u00f6rk, whose singing is fundamentally indebted to Monk's, and others, including the composers Terry Riley, DJ Spooky (who has sampled her on his album \"Drums of Death\"), and John Zorn and the new music ensembles Alarm Will Sound and Bang on a Can All-Stars, along with the Pacific Mozart Ensemble.\n\n\nShe has won many awards including a MacArthur Fellowship, and she holds honorary Doctor of Arts degrees from Bard College, the University of the Arts (Philadelphia), The Julliard School, the San Francisco Art Institute and the Boston Conservatory.\n\nHer music was used in films by Joel and Ethan Coen (The Big Lebowski, 1998) and Jean-Luc Godard (Nouvelle Vague, 1990 and Notre musique, 2004).\n\nIn a recent interview she said that her favourite music includes Brazilian music, especially Caetano Veloso's recordings, the music by Mildred Bailey (\"the great jazz singer from the \u201830s and \u201840s\"), and Bartok's cycle for piano Mikrokosmos.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Black Tones ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9182827.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Garage Rock, Blues-punk, Blues-rock, Afropunk", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Black Tones album title Cobain and Cornbread is a description of the band that lead singer/guitarist Eva came up with playing at a show, in answer to the most commonly asked question, \u201cWhat does your band sound like?\u201d This tasty adroitly description sums up her and her twin drummer Cedric David\u2019s Seattle-spawned punk-blues. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t even sound like our influences,\u201d she explains, \u201cSo the best way I found to describe The Black Tones was to talk about our environment we were raised around, which was a bunch of southerners living in the Northwest.\u201d\n\nLouisiana-bred, though born and raised in Seattle, The Black Tones\u2019 reference to grunge god Kurt and the Native American quick bread cuisine, evokes \u201cSouthern influences in the grey of the Northwest,\u201d Eva says. \u201cIt sort of creates this offspring of rebellion and soul.

Cedric loved it before I did, but then I became a fanatic too.\u201d They really enjoyed the hard rock music used in bouts, drawing them closer to heavy metal.\n\nAbout this time Cedric had started to play the drums and wanted to hear the songs that Eva was writing, which she found exciting. He matched drum parts to songs she had only worked out so far on guitar, later on getting a bass player and another guitarist. As soon as they had a few arranged, they were ready to start performing. They went through some changes: The Black Tones as a four piece only lasted for a while, then became a trio, \u201cbut Cedric and I were the founders and the only consistently reliable members, so now we just keep it as a duo, while hiring other musicians to play instruments live with us.\u201d Eva had also been in an all-girl punk band called BUST, but she ended up channeling everything into The Black Tones with Cedric.\n\nThrough countless shows supporting a few early singles, The Black Tones felt they finally got their first big breakthrough opening for Death Cab for Cutie in an anniversary benefit for the Paramount Theater. \u201cThat was the biggest show we\u2019ve done!\u201d Eva exclaims. She gives credit for reaching that height to NighTrain, the all black female punk band that she says discovered and championed them when they had freshly started.\n\nFor Cobain and Cornbread, The Black Tones are returning from their singles to work with the renowned, glorious grunge producer Jack Endino, introduced to them by Eva\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and music writer Jake Uitti. Jake had interviewed Jack and sent him their song \u201cWoman in Black\u201d without Eva\u2019s knowledge and Jack replied how much he loved it and wanted to work with The Black Tones.\n\n\u201cI was never really big on recording in a studio,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m a live show nut, I just love performing. Being in studios was always very stressful for me, but when we worked with Jack, that totally changed! It was the best recording experience I\u2019ve ever had. Jack is like a scientist, a chemist behind the soundboard. He had great ideas that strengthened each song. I\u2019ve never met anyone with an ear like his, it\u2019s unbelievable, though he\u2019s a calm, humble, kind, efficient, honest and very intelligent guy \u2014 I was so intimidated at first, I mean, here\u2019s the guy who recorded the Melvins, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and the list goes on. And now he\u2019s working with us and he\u2019s really into it!\u201d\n\nCobain and Cornbread also features help from their friend Mason Lowe from Bread & Butter, on \u201cChubby and Tubby\u201d (a frenetic garage rock instrumental ode to the landmark Seattle variety store) and \u201cWelcome Mr. Pink\u201d (the band\u2019s autobiographical anthem). \u201cMason has a great ear and was really amazing to work with.\u201d Ed Brooks mastered all the songs on the record, with Jack checking back in to make sure he was looped on everything. \u201cAs a band we are of course rooting for the record, but it\u2019s even more special when everyone else is as well!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something very unique about the songs (all originals save for a cover of \u201cRiver of Jordan\u201d) and sound unique about the minimalist sound Jack helped The Black Tones achieved, reminding one of the debuts from The Ramones to the Stooges to the Modern Lovers. Eva acknowledges the brute power of the album\u2019s sound, \u201cit\u2019s pretty vulnerable and raw and I like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are songs like \u2018Welcome Mr. Pink\u2019 where you can hear the click sound from me pressing down on the button to turn on my reverb pedal.\u201d Or in their righteous, ferocious Black Power anthem, \u201cKey of Black (They Want Us Dead),\u201d \u201cafter the second guitar chorus when I go back to the solo, I almost forgot to press my Wah Wah pedal back on so it comes in a little late.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not factory made or even ever scratch the surface of perfection, we\u2019re real people, this is real life and these little details remind me of the imperfections of life,\u201d she says. \u201cLife\u2019s real, life\u2019s the blues, coming from the heart. My doctor told me I have a slight heart murmur, well, so does our music!\u201d", "otherInfo": "Nectar Virtual Concert Series #11 featuring THE BLACK TONES & TRES LECHES ! \"Pay What You Will\" via PayPay @ paypal.me/nectarlounge"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Samantha Margret ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10353252.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Pop, Singersongwriter", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Samantha is a singer songwriter and San Francisco native.

Though is difficult to recognize them now, because they have changed in many aspects and grown with their music, they are still one of the best and most famous Argentine punk groups in Latin America. When they were just starting, they played the monotonous punk style characteristic of the punk groups of the late 1980s, but they now play a modern style of the likes of the neo punk. Also they do not wear denim anymore as it has become a fashion and they dislike fashion.\nHigh points in the band's history we include the album El Cielo Puede Esperar (Heaven can wait), which made them famous; the high-selling album Amen and the successful 2003 album Antihumano (Anti-human).\nAll the members of the group are vegetarians and so they have composed many songs promoting animals rights, including Espiral de silencio (Spiral of Silence), San Fermin, Ojos de perro (Dog's Eyes).

There are so many layers to Canadian-Colombian singer Lido Pimienta\u2019s identity that you might get lost in them. But if you did, you\u2019d be missing the point.\n\nHer multi-textural, mind-bending voice and music project what Canada\u2019s The Globe and Mail called her \u201cbold, brash, polarizing\u201d persona, which constantly confronts the powers that be. But it also reveals an embrace of the Afro- and Indigenous traditions that is at once defiant, delicate and sweetly nostalgic.\n\nPimienta\u2019s new album Miss Colombia takes her ecstatic hybridity to a new level, building on the \u201cnu\u201d intersection of electronica and cumbia established by her first two albums, Color, released in 2010, and the 2016 Polaris Prize-winning La Papessa as Canadian album of the year. The latter was the first 100% independently released, non- English or French album to win the $50,000 prize. Produced with Matt Smith, a/k/a Prince Nifty, Miss Colombia overflows with the kind of understated genius that promises yet another breakthrough.\n\nAs a Canadian global-beats trailblazer, Lido has an affinity for acts like A Tribe Called Red and Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq, but her work also resonates with British-Sri Lankan rapper MIA and she draws unabashed inspiration from the New York-bred Dominican-Trinidadian rap queen Cardi B. Miss Colombia has the effect of expanding the narrative about her dual Colombian/Canadian identity to her family\u2019s mixed roots in the Afro-Colombian and Indigenous Wayuu communities, while establishing an ambitious new sonic palette that brings her closer to home.\n\nWho or what exactly is Miss Colombia? Pimienta\u2019s new album\u2019s title was inspired by Miss Universe MC Steve Harvey\u2019s gaffe in 2015 when he mistakenly awarded the crown to Miss Colombia instead of the actual winner, Miss Philippines. The incident not only caused her to reflect on the anti-blackness she experienced as a child growing up in Barranquilla, but the fact that while her sister was groomed to be a beauty queen, she suffered through an awkward adolescence as the \u201cweird artistic tomboy\u201d of the family.\n\n\u201cSo I was like am I still Colombian or should I just keep calm and carry on because I\u2019m Canadian now?\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the premise and genesis of Miss Colombia.\u201d\n\nThe central mood of Miss Colombia coalesces around a series of moving, musical poems embracing how she\u2019s loved and lost. The journey magically documents an introspection tinged with sadness, yet still evoking a kind of optimism about experiencing the emotion in glorious repetition. \u201cTe Quer\u00eda,\u201d (I Wanted You) pulses with a kind of samba-like cumbia, floating in the memory of desire and denial. The narrator\u2019s \u201cwant\u201d is quickly dismissed by quoting 2018\u2019s Latin trap hit \u201cTe Bot\u00e9\u201d (I discarded you).\n\nAs Pimienta more firmly grounded herself in her return to the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where Miss Colombia was recorded \u201clive\u201d in rustic settings, her approach evolved from the opulent electronic crafting of La Papessa to something even more sensual and spiritual. The change in scenery helped her closer to her goal of re-contextualizing her music. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to control electronic music,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhat\u2019s hard about electronic music is to make it sound emotional, make it sound beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe emblematic track \u201cEso Que Tu Haces,\u201d flows with an ethereal mysticism that fuses Lido\u2019s love for traditional porro and slow-building cumbia. Its unique orchestral swirl of wind instruments and synthetic sounds quickly sets the tone for Miss Colombia. On \u201cNada,\u201d she teams up with Bomba Estereo\u2019s Li Samuet, venturing further with her transcendent soprano, crafted with precision and clarity, and driven by sharp-edged metallic beats.\n\nLido clearly remembers the moment when she began her journey as a transnational, cultural mixing experiment as a singer. The brashly dynamic electro-cumbia diva had gone through several phases, starting in her early teens fronting punk and metal bands, and had become obsessed with trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack and Tricky.\n\n\u201cIt was before I moved to Canada, I was in this dance group called Cumb\u00e9 in Colombia,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy cousin was one of the drummers in the group and he told me, \u2018you know you have a really good voice, why would you waste that voice on this depressing music?\u201d\n\nPimienta\u2019s cousin then introduced her to an Afro-Colombian group called Sexteto Tabala, who she later collaborated with on the song \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves\u201d (I Want You To Save Me). Initially formed in 1996, Sexteto Tabal\u00e1 are the cultural heartbeat of Palenque and guardians of Afro-Latin musical history who can swing like a salsa band, groove like a fuji orchestra and serenade you all at the same time. They are one of the most representative musical expressions of the African communities in Colombia.\n\nPimienta credits her time in Sexteto with the development of her singing and overall aesthetic. \u201cThat\u2019s what shaped me, how I learned to have stage control,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because of some bar in Ontario; it was because I was in front of thousands of people singing Afro-Colombian spiritual music.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the flow of Miss Colombia so riveting and rewarding. Structurally it\u2019s bookended by two versions of \u201cPara Transcribir,\u201d one listed as \u201cSol,\u201d (Sun) and the other \u201cLuna\u201d (Moon), a song that tries to come to grips with Pimienta--who is fully bilingual--as a perpetual translator of cultures. The edgy playfulness of her love songs gives way to tracks like \u201cQuiero Que Me Salves,\u201d \u201cPelo Cucu,\u201d which celebrates the symbolic African texture of her hair, and \u201cResisto y Ya,\u201d which makes pointed reference to recent massive Colombian protests against the current government.\n\nWith the latter track, Lido wants to make it clear that while she shares the popular disdain for a \u201cpolitics of division\u201d that squeezes Colombians, she insists that just by being who she is, an Afro-Indigenous, queer feminist, and Canadian outsider, she has always been engaged in resistance.

Sinclar started DJing in 1986, when he was just 18 years old, specializing in funk and hip-hop music, with the name Chris The French Kiss. His first club hit was Gym & Tonic, a track produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.\n\nSinclar is famous for popularizing the \"french touch\" of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track \"Feel for You\", a tribute to french musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elys\u00e9es, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track \"Darlin'\", he worked with vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams.\n\nSinclar has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of latin, jazz, african and tribal flavors. In 2005 he scored a hit with his single \"Love Generation\", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40. The followup hit was \"World, Hold On\", that features Steve Edwards and also managed to chart in the top ten in most of the European countries. \"Rock this Party (Everybody Dance Now)\" followed on August 22, 2006.\n\nThe remix of \"World, Hold on\" by E-Smoove is nominated for a Grammy 2007 in the category \"Remixed Recording\". Also, \"World Hold on\" was chosen by Billboard Magazine as the number one Hot Dance Club Play Single of 2006, beating Madonna and Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe fourth single of the album 'Western Dream' called 'Tennessee' was supposed to be released in April 2007, but has been cancelled due to the rumour of a new album being released.\n\nThis album is Soundz Of Freedom. It came out in France on May 21st. It has not yet come out in the United States.\n\nTaken from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Sinclar)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "King Earthquake ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rinaly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9178985.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Trance", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rinaly is a Japanese music producer and DJ since 2014.

Classic, contemporary, and a total breath of fresh air in the current musical landscape, Jade Bird is that rare, next-generation artist who appears as clued up on the past as she is determined to learn from its lessons: in control, sometimes in your face, and in possession of gifts beyond her years.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Eliane Rodrigues ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8897931.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Piano, Classical, Classical Music", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Eliane Rodrigues was born in Rio de Janeiro. Her musical talent was discovered early on and fostered by Helena Guimar\u00e3es Galo and Arnaldo Estrella (student of Alfred Cortot and friend of Villa Lobos), at the Conservatory of Antwerp student of Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge, student of Arthur Schnabel>Leon Fleisher>Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge.\n\nShe played a first recital at the age of 5 in the Teatro Mesbla in Rio de Janeiro. First TV performance at age 6 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Alceo Bocchino with a Haydn concerto, and another two times the same concerto conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho and Isaac Karabtchevsky with the Orquestra Sinfonica Brasileira. At age 7 she performed Mozart KV488 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Edouard van Remoortel (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nIn the USA she received the \"special prize\" of the jury at the Van Cliburn competition, and she made an indelible impression with Beethoven\u00b4s piano concerto n.4 at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.\n\nAfter the \"wonderkind\" and \"competitions\" happenings, she received invitations to perform in more than 25 countries. Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos. In 1994-95 she wrote her 15 Momentos Musicais and composed the Sonate Oubli\u00e9e with themes from her childhood. Her characteristics have remained unchanged: simplicity and spontaneity, feeling and imagination, technique, perfection without affectation, a delight for the eye and ear.\n\nIn February 1998 Rodrigues' Bach-CD was recorded. The critics describe her improvisations and paraphrases on works for the organ as: \"The sonorities go back to the scale of more than 3 centuries of piano literature and link perfectly well up with the richness in colour of an independent way of pianistic thinking, they have their own new life, a fascinating transfiguration, full of phantasy.\"\n\nAstonishment, admiration and even incredibility caused her Suite n.1 \"Rio de Janeiro\" for piano and orchestra, that was first performed on 9 August 2000. She plaid and recorded in St. Petersburg the 5 concerto's for piano from Sergei Prokofiev with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n1998 - 2014 she is invited in a.o. Amsterdam, Antwerp, Brussels, Den Haag, Lisbon, Moscow, New-York, N\u00fcrnberg, Rotterdam, St. Petersburg, Volgograd, Z\u00fcrich.\n\nOver the last few years Eliane Rodrigues has also won great acclaim as a conductor. She has trained with Herbert Slegers (theory), Alexander Dmitriev, Edward Serov, Dmitri Liss and Juozas Domarkas (practical), Gloria Rodrigues-da Silva, prima ballerina (choreographer/kinematics).\n\nShe can now lead the orchestra to produce great classical compositions as she has already done for example with Beethoven\u2019s piano sonatas.\n\nEliane Rodrigues is professor on the Royal Conservatory of Antwerp.", "otherInfo": "Come join Eliane at home and listen to various pieces of her vast repertoire!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tones And I ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9347364.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Indie", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rinaly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9178985.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Trance", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rinaly is a Japanese music producer and DJ since 2014.

He trained for ten years, developing a distinct passion for Jazz. Soon after the sound of Hip Hop provoked him to not only form his own band but also to start his foray into DJ'ing and production. Then came house as Satoshi became fascinated by the early Chicago mix-tapes he was hearing.\n\nA Japanese cosmetic company asked Satoshi to produce a track for their forthcoming promo parties where the legendary DJ Frankie Knuckles was performing. Knuckles saw the potential in Satoshi's music and asked if he was interested in collaborating. The final result of their partnership was \"Tears\", a defining moment in vocal house and a song now commonly regarded as an all time classic. Satoshi soon took the leap and moved to New York. Since his seminal hit \"Tears\" with Knuckles back in 1989, he has gone on to become a major part of the acclaimed Def Mix crew. Tomiie has remixed and worked with the likes of Photek, Kosheen, Simply Red, David Bowie, U2, Mariah Carey, and Misia (Japan's #1 R&B artist), just to name a few.\n\nIn 2000 Satoshi wrote and produced his debut album for Sony entitled \"Full Lick\" featuring performances by Kelli Ali, former front woman for the Sneaker Pimps, Diane Charlemagne, Robert Owens and others. The album has been met with critical acclaim by his fans and the press with each single enjoying top ten dance chart success. \"Up in Flames\", garnered a number one dance hit in the UK and included mixes from John Digweed. In the US, \"Up in Flames\" and \"Darkness\" established Satoshi's presence in the alternative music scene as well as the dance music scene. The Global Underground compilation mixed by John Digweed also featured \"Love in Traffic\" the most recognizable single from \"Full Lick\" in addition to three other \"Satoshi\" productions/ remixes.\n\nIn 2001, Satoshi Tomiie launched his own label \"SAW.RECORDINGS\". The word SAW comes from \"SAW is one of the names of the sound wave (Sine, Square, Triangle and so on). These are used by various kinds of electronic music producers regardless of the style; most of them use and tweak these waveforms to compose music. Regardless of the style, SAW.RECORDINGS would like to introduce quality music to the music scene. We also would like to be a tool for DJ's (as SAW).\" states Tomiie.\n\nIt was Satoshi's desire to create a platform from which he would be able to showcase ideas and creativity that are more experimental. SAW\u00d5s first single release \"Paranoize\" by Bipath caused major excitement from DJ's worldwide. Follow up singles, Madam \"Penetration\" and Tomiie\u00d5s own \"Virus\" gave SAW world recognition.\n\n2002 has brought forth singles and EP\u00d5s from the likes of Akadoma, Jerry Bonham and Tigerhook, with a debut production from the remix team Gabriel & Dresden entitled \"Lament\" at the end of the year Tomiie\u00d5s Saw label is forging ahead. 2003 brings Echomen \"Perpetual\" the first vocally driven record for the Label. Tomiie's ongoing philosophy to push the envelope and expose new talents has assisted in the launch of such new producer / dj\"s as Trendroids and Lexicon Avenue. If SAW.RECORDINGS is an example of the direction that Satoshi is heading in, he is acknowledging the changes in the dance music scene, thus shifting what House music is. House music never stops evolving and expanding its borders and Satoshi Tomiie is in the forefront of this movement.\n\nSatoshi is the first American based DJ to be asked to record a NuBreed album (#6) for International label Global Underground. Nubreed is known for only working with the leading cutting edge DJ's. With a world tour under way, Tomiie launched the North American leg with a Spundae party in San Francisco and continued traveling throughout the USA, Europe, of South America, Asia, and Australia. His Nubreed album is the fastest and highest selling Nubreed album to date.\n\nReceiving the highest honor as a DJ, in December Satoshi Tomiie was voted by the public into the #30 spot of the World\u00d5s Top 100 DJ List. Satoshi is also finding International recognition now as a Label owner besides his proven talents as a DJ, Producer / Artist and Musician. 2003 Satoshi has again launched his world tour on the west coast of the United States and will be touring well into the fall.\n\nHe released Satoshi Tomiie presents Ice entitled \"Scandal in New York\" and has just completed a DJ Mix compilation titled UNDULATION 1. A collaboration with Label Manager and DJ Hector Romero that is releasing with a tour in October.\n\nhttp://www.satoshitomiie.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "An On Bast ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mat Playford ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "House, Disco, Techno, R&b, Soul, Electronic, Rnb-soul, R&b/soul", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Giorgia Angiuli ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8723124.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\u25baWE LOVE @ BPitch Control Records // Einmusika // KMS // Crosstown // Harry Klein \u25baVIDEO VIMEO [https://vimeo.com/giorgiaangiuli] \u25baVIDEO YOUTUBE [http://www.youtube.com/user/giorgiaangiuli] \u25baSOUNDS [https://soundcloud.com/giorgiaangiuli-1] \u25baINSTAGRAM [http://instagram.com/giorgia_angiuli] Discogs http://www.discogs.com/search?q=giorgia angiuli&type=all BIOGRAPHY Born in Puglia, also known as the heel of Italy\u00b4s boot, Giorgia is a composer and multi-instrumentalist.

Coming up near Chicago in the early 90s, Intel grew up in the early days of Hip Hop with a fascination for turntablism. He quickly hit the decks with a set of turntables and a mixer he \u201cborrowed\u201d from his brother, and started off on the path that Chicago DJ legends like PNS and Tone B Nimble paved. Between the house parties and the B-boy battles, Intel quickly made a name for himself across the Midwest.\n\nIntel still holds down the decks for the B-boys, but his scope and style--fueled by his limitless passion and innovation--have evolved. The kid honing his craft on hand-me-down tables now shares (or steals, depending on your perspective) the stage with Hip Hop legends (Lupe Fiasco, Afrika Bambaataa, Wu-Tang Clan, ?Love), EDM greats (Amon Tobin, Kid Koala, Nero, The Prodigy) and three time world DMC champion DJ Qbert, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. He holds down quite a few residencies in Chicago, including the world famous Smart Bar, rips up stages at huge music festivals (Lollapalooza, North Coast Music Fest, SXSW) and works everything from charitable events to openings to fashion shows for clients like: Adidas, Red Bull, Scion, AT&T and Microsoft.\n\nWNUR and the DJZTRIP.com community both voted DJ Intel \u2018Best MixTape DJ.\u2019 The New York Post and Entertainment Weekly both love him. The people at his Face Melt parties love him.

Kryder\u2019s release of \u2018Aphrodite\u2019 on Axtone Records was a crowning moment in the early stages of his career. Today the formidable force of Kryder\u2019s music packs a powerful punch, with support from artists such as Pete Tong, Fatboy Slim, Steve Angello, Axwell, Bob Sinclair, Erick Morillo and Basement Jaxx to name but a few, his stellar list of admirers has been a testament to his desire to push boundaries both on the road and in the studio and has seen him cement himself as an established producer that can be relied upon to bring the heat on the dancefloor, signified by him placing as one of the 10 most supported producers in 2017 on 1001 Tracklists\n\nThere is lots of new music on the horizon, after his recent Erick Morillo collaboration and a forthcoming Steve Angello team-up, as well as writing the Sensation Chile Anthem in 2017, which was released via Spinnin\u2019. With a seasoned understanding of what it takes to rock the dancefloor, his jam-packed schedule continues to build momentum, with several standout shows at Miami Music Week 2018 adding to his impressive list of performances which have included festivals such as Creamfields, Mysteryland, Tomorrowland, Dance Valley, Ultra, Tomorrowland, Sensation, Electric Love and Medusa.\n\nAfter giving fans something back with his free music imprint Sosumi Records, which ran for 100 releases, 2018 sees Kryder branch out with Kryteria Records, partnering with the formidable Spinnin\u2019 Records to create the label arm of his hugely successful Kryteria Radio show, which itself is syndicated to over 100 FM stations worldwide, with over 100,000 weekly subscribers on iTunes.

The music emanating from the DJ booth is that perfect club mix of driving percussion and soaring musicality, bursting out of the speakers, soaking everyone in melody, drenching them in sound. On the floor, where it really matters, the crowd experiences all the peaks and troughs that make Warren\u2019s sensibility so unique. He might start with his deeper take on house, then gradually morph into harder territory; then, once Warren has the throng fully in his grip, sweating and losing themselves in the grooves, moving on instinct, he takes them to points unknown they never expected to go. That's why Nick Warren is so respected: he knows how to truly work a crowd, delivering again and again, yet taking them somewhere they\u2019ve never been before. That's what comes with vision and, just as importantly in Warren\u2019s case, experience.\n\nTo this day, Warren remains at the forefront of club culture: he packs clubs and arenas worldwide from London to Los Angeles to Taipei, transfixing dancefloors with his distinctively forward blend of credible progressive sounds, cutting-edge techno, atmospheric breaks and any other crucial grooves Warren deems appropriate for his turntable alchemy. 2008 also finds Warren reaching other milestones. He\u2019s releasing his eighth mix CD for the Global Underground series, GU035: Lima; he\u2019s also completing his fourth studio album with Way Out West, Warren\u2019s pioneering electronic/band collaboration with Jody Wisternoff. Warren also recently became head of A&R for Hope Recordings, keeping him immersed in the shifting tides of new dance-music movements. \u201cI\u2019m doing same thing I did when I started\u2014just playing music I love,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s as inspiring as ever. In Lima, we did the party for the Global mix on the grass in front of a stadium, and the crowd was as enthusiastic and curious as any I\u2019ve ever had. It was one of the best parties I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nWhat makes Warren\u2019s vision continue to resonate is that he\u2019s honed it over the years. He was there for the dawn of today\u2019s club culture, and the original ethos of bringing integrity and a forward, future-looking aesthetic to what he does never left him. Warren began spinning at free parties in fields during acid house\u2019s halcyon \u201cSummer of Love\u201d back in \u201988: then, the revelry typically ended around lunchtime two days after the rave began, and seminal electronic artists like Leftfield and Orbital were making their mark with their first tracks. The culture was so new, DJs weren\u2019t considered the icons they are today; if you were behind the decks, you were doing it for the music above all else, not money or fame. Despite Warren\u2019s continuing success, that original motivation has never left him. \u201cWe never wanted to be \u2018superstar DJs,\u2019\u201d Warren says of himself and his peers that rose to fame out of the dance-music revolution. \u201cThere was no such thing. I was just lucky to be there at the beginning. In those days, we were focused on creating and playing the next thing\u2014music no one else had ever heard.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s DJ sets always were set apart by their moody atmosphere\u2014a key element of music from his Bristol hometown. Warren ascribes that to the influence of the city\u2019s multicultural makeup, which found punters of all races attending dub parties from the likes of Jah Shakti. \u201cSeeing him make so many sounds with just one turntable was incredible,\u201d Warren recalls. \u201cIt was all about moving hips, about reverb, about the space between sounds. That epic silence in the right place became the sound of Bristol.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018control freak\u2019 side that every DJ has still comes out in me whenever I play music in a dark room,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhether it\u2019s 600 people in a club or 10,000 at a festival, I love that I can take the crowd anywhere. It\u2019s amazing I\u2019m still surprised every day. When I stop searching for music, I\u2019ll have to quit. But the moment, I\u2019m as excited as I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.residentadvisor.net/dj_profiles.asp?ID=58", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sounds of A&R ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10274337.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "BILLBOARD and Jazz Week Chart Artist\n\nAward Winning jazz duo!

Townes (born January 22, 1965 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), also known as DJ Jazzy Jeff, is an American hip hop and R&B record producer and turntablist. He is best known for his early career with Will Smith as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. DJ Jazzy Jeff graduated from John Bartram High School in Philadelphia where he is enshrined in the school's \"Wall of Fame\".\n\nHistory\n\nWhen he was growing up, he found that listening to his parents was unbearable. He got a job as a newspaper boy at age 7 to support his family. Once he grew up, he developed a reputation and following as a school and block party DJ extraordinaire, Jazzy Jeff was the feature of the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. As a duo, they had several gold and platinum-selling albums and singles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, earning them the first rap Grammy ever presented in 1989 for Parents Just Don't Understand. When Smith branched out into television with the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Jazzy Jeff played a recurring character named \"Jazz\", Smith's best friend on the show. The two characters always greeted each other with their signature handshake (swinging mid-five, point-back/snap with both characters saying \"Pssh!\").\n\nJazz' trademarks include being physically ejected from the house by Uncle Phil (James Avery), screaming as he went flying out the front door. This was referenced in the song \"N.Y, N.Y.\" by Lloyd Banks from his second album Rotten Apple, with the lyric \"I throw a bitch out the crib like Jazzy Jeff\". [1]\n\nDJ Jazzy Jeff is not to be confused with Jeffrey Myree from the earlier hip hop group Funky Four Plus One, which in fact filed and won a lawsuit over the name Jazzy Jeff against Jeff Townes and Jive records when they signed DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. After DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince broke up, Townes went on to become a prominent R&B, soul, and neo soul record producer, establishing the A Touch of Jazz production company in his native Philadelphia. Among the artists that Jazzy Jeff has helped develop are Jill Scott and Musiq. Even though he separated from Will Smith as music partners, they are still best friends and still occasionally work together. Some songs by Will Smith were produced by Jeff Townes (Ex. Here He Comes), and he has performed on some songs by Will Smith such as \"So Fresh\" and \"Potnas\". In addition, he appears in several of Smith's music videos such as \"Will2K\", \"Freakin' It\", and \"Party Starter\". On some occasions, he makes appearances with Smith on live concerts, producing DJ scratches.\n\nHe, along with DJ Cash Money, is credited with making the transform scratch famous.\n\nOn July 2, 2005, DJ Jazzy Jeff performed with Will Smith at the Live 8 concert in Philadelphia. In the past, Will has performed on concerts with DJ Jazzy Jeff for the scratches. Moreover, Will acknowledges him in his music like \"Comin' To The Stage\" from the album Lost & Found or \"Potnas\" in his album Willennium.\n\nHis 2007 release TROTM (The Return of the Magnificent) is a classic work which returns to the roots of hip-hop with a neo-soul mixture included. This album featured numerous collaborations with old school and new school artists including CL Smooth, Big Daddy Kane, Pos from De La Soul, Method Man, Peedi Crakk (a remake of Brand New Funk), Rhymefest, and Raheem DeVaughn.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared with Rhymefest in the video DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Fest directed by Konee Rok, in which he makes music in his home recording studio with Rhymefest and they reveal that they are working on an album together called \"I'm the DJ, I'm the Rapper\".\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo work as DJ Jazzy Jeff\n\n* Unreleased album from Sony Records (1998)\n* One cut in Battle of DJs\n* The Magnificent (2002)\n* Soulheaven Presents Jazzy Jeff in the House (2004)\n* The Soul Mixtape Groovin' Records USA (2005)\n* Hip-Hop Forever II Rapster Records (2004)\n* Hip-Hop Forever III BBE Records (2006)\n* The Return of The Magnificent EP (2007)\n* The Return of the Magnificent (2007)\n* The Return of Hip Hop EP (2007)\n\n\nAs DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince\n\n* Rock the House (1987) #83 US (Gold)\n* He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper (1988) #4 US (3x Platinum)\n* And in This Corner\u2026 (1989) #39 US (Gold)\n* Homebase (1991) #12 US (Platinum)\n* Code Red (1993) #64 US (Gold)\n* Greatest Hits (1998) #144 US, #20 UK\n* Before The Willennium (1999)\n* The Very Best of D.J.

Bergson doesn't do predictable, but there's a visible thread of blues awareness running through the fabric of everything he writes, sings and plays: he is a concise and subtle guitarist and tough, grainy singer.\" The Blues Magazine (UK)\n\nWith MOJO Magazine's #1 Blues Album of 2008, Fall Changes, #2 Blues Album of 2011, Imitate the Sun, #3 Blues Album of 2014, Live at Jazz Standard and #3 Blues Album of 2017, Bitter Midnight , New York guitarist/singer Chris Bergson has established himself as \"one of the most inventive songwriters in modern blues music\" (All Music Guide), creating his own blend of blues, roots and soul. Chris Bergson has performed and/or shared the stage with Hubert Sumlin, Levon Helm, B.B. King, Norah Jones, John Hammond, Etta James, and Bettye LaVette, to name just a few.\n\n2014 CD RELEASE: LIVE AT JAZZ STANDARD\nLABEL: 2 SHIRTS / INNSBRUCK RECORDS MEDIA\n\nLive at Jazz Standard, the latest CD release from the Chris Bergson Band, was recorded live over two nights at NYC's Jazz Standard with Bergson's usual four-piece band (organ/wurlitzer, bass and drums) \"augmented with a horn section expert in the snap and crackle of bluesy soul.\" (The Blues Magazine UK) The fifteen song CD contains eight brand new original songs from New York guitarist/singer Chris Bergson \"...one of the most inventive songwriters in modern blues music.\" (All Music Guide) as well as new arrangements of five older originals from the band's back catalog. According to iTunes Editors' Notes:\n\n\"A fair number of hot shot guitarists can lay down licks with presence and panache, but that number shrinks drastically when you tally the ones who are also sharp-shooting singer/songwriters. That\u00eds what makes Chris Bergson an unusual triple threat and this live recording shines a spotlight on the strength of his material as well as the alternately simmering and fiery feel that he and his band serve up in a club setting. New York City native Chris Bergson is a bluesman of a distinctly urban stripe. Instead of swamps and rivers, his songs - many penned in collaboration with lyricist Kate Ross - are full of citified imagery from the midtown Manhattan locale of \"61st & 1st\" to the Brooklyn scenes of \"Gowanus Heights.\" The three-man horn section accentuates the soul leanings of tunes like \"The Only One\" and brings out the R&B shadings in Bergson's gritty growl. At times, the blend of Bergson's earthy vocals and terse, biting guitar with Craig Dreyer's organ evokes The Band. Yet whether the guitarist and his group are venturing into R&B, roots rock or straight blues, they create an invitingly organic feel on a recording that clearly captures the band in their element.\"\n\nSpecial guests include soul singer Ellis Hooks and a three piece horn section featuring baritone saxophonist Ian Hendrickson-Smith (Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings), tenor saxophonist David Luther (Bettye LaVette) and Grammy Award-winning trumpeter Freddie Hendrix performing horn arrangements by Jay Collins (Gregg Allman).\n\nJazz Standard has been a musical home for the Chris Bergson Band for the past ten years and provided an ideal venue for their first live record. The album was recorded and co-produced by award-winning producer/engineer Roman Klun whose credits include albums by the Spin Doctors, Joan Osborne and the Holmes Brothers.\n\nBergson has had the opportunity to play with two masters of American music - drummer/singer Levon Helm of The Band and Howlin' Wolf's guitarist Hubert Sumlin - and their influence can be heard throughout the album.\n\nNotable past performances include:\nMoulin Blues (Holland), Groningen Rhythm and Blues Night (Holland), Blues Open (Holland), Noct en Blues (Chaumont, France), Blues in Hell (Norway), Harvest Time Blues (Ireland), Leicester Blues Festival (UK), Waterfront Blues Festival (Portland, OR), Saratoga Jazz Festival (NY), Levon Helm's Midnight Rambles (Woodstock, NY), River to River Festival (NYC), Joe\u2019s Pub (NYC), The Blue Note (NYC), Jazz Standard (NYC), John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (DC), SXSW, and opening for B.B. King at B.B. King's Blues Club (NYC).\n\nBorn in New York City but raised in Somerville, Massachusetts, Chris Bergson returned to Manhattan in\n1995. While backing jazz singers Annie Ross, Dena DeRose, Sasha Dobson and Norah Jones, he released\nBlues for Some Friends of Mine and Wait for Spring on Juniper Records in 1997 and 2000,\nrespectively. In 2002 Bergson was appointed a Jazz Ambassador of the USA by the John F. Kennedy\nCenter for the Performing Arts and he toured Africa with his trio. Evolving to further embrace the blues\nwhile also adding pop influences, he followed up with Blues (2003), Another Day (2005) and his\ntriumphant artistic breakthrough, the widely acclaimed Fall Changes (2007) -- MOJO\u2019s #1 Blues Album\nof 2008 -- that established him as an eloquent, evocative and lyrical songwriter with a sharp urban vision.\nRecorded at Levon Helm\u2019s Woodstock studio, it led to Bergson being personally invited to perform at the\nfamed drummer\u2019s Midnight Rambles while opening the way for more stateside festivals and subsequent\ntours of Europe.\n\nClick here to read Kay Cordtz's in-depth profile of Chris Bergson in ROLL Magazine:\nwww.rollmagazine.com\n\nChris Bergson currently serves on the faculty of NYC's 92Y where he teaches Rock, Blues and Jazz guitar and is the music mentor for the Recanati-Kaplan Scholarship Program.\n\nBergson endorses McCurdy Guitars and Levy's Leathers Gig Bags.\n\nSelected Press\n\n\"Gut-busting, horn-bedecked NY blues...

Answering someone\u2019s questions about who you are has always seemed a strange way to approach the task of telling others about yourself and your life\u2019s mission. Because who knows you better than you do?\n\nIn order to alleviate that emotion of seeming vanity, I decided to take on the job myself.\n\nI was raised by people who found life hard and wonderful at the same time. A farm in central Kentucky is what I call my homeland. The tender shoots that sprang from my grandfather\u2019s carefully plowed rows were lessons about life. Planting, reaping, seedtime, and harvest, these are the bases of all of our existence, really. We planted each spring to make sure we survived the winter\u2019s dark days. Spiritually we are nothing if we are not farmers planting seeds for the Master\u2019s great wedding day harvest.\n\nWe celebrated the rain after weeks of drought, always decidedly giving glory to God for His provision.\n\nWe fed and housed ornery old Angus and Herford cows as if they were better than we were. We sweated through the heat of tobacco season and we prayed before every meal. We were fed on the baby food of \u201cevery good gift comes from the Father.\u201d As we matured, we graduated to the meat of \u201cthough He slay me, yet, I will praise Him.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, no one has ever asked me how I came to follow Jesus. Of course my parents and grandparents held my feet to each precept of Christianity, but just because that is so does not mean salvation for me. Actually, I was wooed. For years, I sat and listened to the congregational songs, and their gospel plucked strings in my heart. It was not until I went to youth camp that it became clear that I had to take part in my Savior\u2019s death by repentance. After camp, I did just that. There was not a parade. There were no fireworks. There were no flaming tongues falling at the front pew where I knelt. It was just Mrs. Davenport and me kneeling there. She prayed the words first, and I repeated them. I have repeated them in some fashion every day since. \u201cLord, forgive me for I am a sinner.\u201d After words that heavy, God does the great and awesome remaking of a human heart. Nothing is ever the same then. Thank God for that.\n\nThough I did not come from a musically literate family, music has always been a part of me. Each week my mother cleaned the small Baptist church where we attended. My job was to vacuum the never-ending sea of sanctuary carpet. Mom allowed me to take a turntable from our home and listen to records as I swept. At the time, I only owned two LP\u2019s. One I got from a mail order ad of Keith Green. The record was sent on a \u201cjust send what you can\u201d basis from Keith\u2019s ministry. \u201cSo You Wanna Go Back to Egypt?\u201d was the title. Keith impacted my life by allowing me to pay for the recording with what I had, which was $2.50. Another LP landed in my pile of two from God only knows where. It was The Gaither Trio recording called \u201cWe Are Persuaded.\u201d I would listen to that music for hours, and would often look at Gloria\u2019s smile. I remember being envious of their happy faces and locked arms as they skipped down the sidewalk together. I understood that music then, but understand it even more deeply now. \u201cBecause He Lives\u201d was on that recording. I swept, dusted, picked up discarded bulletins, and sang, \u201cI know who holds the future, and life is worth the living just because He lives.\u201d\n\nLast weekend I got off the Gaither\u2019s bus at the arena. I walked along side of Bill into the auditorium. He seemed to be skipping, and so I skipped along beside him.

Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989. His ever-elevating profile led to global touring work in the bands of Taj Mahal, John Scofield, Dr. John, and Bonnie Raitt. Cleary has led his own group, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, for over two decades now, but he still collaborates frequently with these old friends. At the 2018 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, for instance, Cleary performed alongside Raitt in a heartfelt tribute to Fats Domino.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "LP Giobbi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8890908.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electro House, Dance Pop, House, Electro Pop, Disco", "Time": "5:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LP Giobbi is rock \u2019n roll with a disco soul, born draped in sequins and cloaked in fog at a seance in the mountains of Oregon.\n\nShe was trained in jazz piano at UC Berkeley before becoming a synth warrior goddess in Los Angeles.

Aptly described by the Miami Herald as an artist blessed with, \u201cthe warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra, and the sly elegance of Nat \u2018King' Cole,\u201d the ample and aural evidence of Harris\u2019 multifaceted talent can be heard on his ten recordings as a leader; his far-flung and critically-acclaimed concerts around the world, from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, and Washington DC\u2019s Kennedy Center, to the 2012 London Olympics, and a number of prestigious bookings in Europe, The Middle East and Asia, and his numerous awards, which include the New York Nightlife Award for \u201cOutstanding Jazz Vocalist\u201d \u2013 which he won three times \u2013 the Backstage Bistro Award for \u201cOngoing Achievement in Jazz,\u201d and the Harlem Speaks \u201cJazz Museum of Harlem Award.\u201d\nHarris\u2019 new album, Black Bar Jukebox, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Brian Bacchus (Norah Jones, Gregory Porter), is his most compelling and comprehensive recording to date. \u201cBelieve me, what Brian brought to the table was wonderful,\u201d Harris says, \u201cnot only because of his music, but also because of the vision, and the way he hears things. I\u2019m enamored with the sound I got.\u201d Inspired by the jazz, R&B, soul, country and Latin sounds that emanated from jukeboxes in African-American barbershops, clubs, bars, and restaurants, from the mid to late twentieth century, the album \u2013 which features Harris\u2019 accomplished band of three years: drummer Jake Goldbas, bassist Leon Boykins, and pianist/keyboardist Pascal Le Boeuf; with special guests, percussionist Samuel Torres and guitarist Yotam Silberstein \u2013 also marks his moving and momentous return to his jazz-centered, Harlem roots, where he heard all those aforementioned styles, genres and grooves in the Golden Age of the seventies. \u201cGrowing up, I heard the sound of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Nat King Cole,\u201d Harris says, \u201cI was always cognizant of jazz.\u201d\nBlack Bar Jukebox features thirteen selections that include several popular standards and originals penned by Harris. His soulful, silken bari-tenor voice dances and trances throughout an eclectic spectrum of moods and grooves: from the moving, mid-tempo, 4/4 swing of \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d \u201cA Little Bit Scared\u201d and the Count Basie-ish, \u201cJumping at the Woodside\u201d vibe of \u2018I Got The Blues,\u201d to the Ahmad Jamal, \u201cPoinciana\u201d-pulsed \u201cMiami,\u201d the Latin-tinged \u201cCatfish,\u201d \u201cTake Me To The Pilot,\u201d which can be compared to Les McCann\u2019s soulful grooves, and an ebullient cover of pop singer John Mayer\u2019s \u201cDaughters,\u201d which features Harris\u2019 spare and syncopated guitar strains.\nAllan Harris\u2019 soulful sound on Black Bar Jukebox comes from his rich musical home life, which extended deep into the artistic world of Harlem. Harris\u2019 mother, Johanna Chemina Ingram-Harris, was a concert pianist, and was a graduate of the first class of New York\u2019s legendary High School for the Performing Arts. Growing up, Harris went to Apollo Sunday afternoon matinees, and he visited his aunt Kate Ingram\u2019s famous soul food restaurant, Kate's Home Cooking; located behind the Apollo Theater, which was featured on the cover of organist Jimmy Smith\u2019s 1960 Blue Note LP, Home Cookin.\u2019\n\nIn this soulful setting, Harris would meet many jazz and R&B stars who worked at the Apollo and came by the restaurant to eat and hang out. Another aunt, Theodosia Ingram, won the Apollo Theater\u2019s Amateur Night Competition and performed at a number of Manhattan clubs, including The Lenox Lounge under her stage name, \u201cPhoebe.\u201d It was through her, that Harris would meet and be mentored by a seminal jazz figure, Clarence Williams. \u201cWe used to go to his record store, and he\u2019d come into our house on Lincoln Avenue,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cAt the time I was a child ... I just thought that was just a part of my life. And later, I understood the gravity of the depth of his history. Yes: Clarence Williams opened up a lot of doors for me, to really get me into this genre called jazz.\u201d It was Williams who brought Louis Armstrong to the Harris home, and babysat the future crooner, who was frightened by Satchmo\u2019s gravelly, \"frog like voice.\"\n\nHarris is a first call vocalist (especially back in Harlem), as evidenced by his potpourri of engagements, including an impressive run as a featured soloist and producer of Sotheby\u2019s three-year jazz series. His commitment to education is as equally impressive as his recordings and engagements. A Gibson guitarist, Harris is a long-time supporter of the St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, and donates a performance every year to Challenge Aspen/America, along with Vince Gill and Amy Grant.\nAll of which brings us to Black Bar Jukebox: a diverse and dynamic disc that showcases Allan Harris at the zenith of his all-encompassing artistry. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller through the genre of jazz,\u201d concludes Harris.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Saad Ayub ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8985399.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Trance, Progressive, Techno", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Saad Ayub is a Toronto, Canada based DJ and producer.

Their ultimate mission: to explore the opaque realms between extreme metal and electronic tunes, to pioneer the invention of new approaches of joining two traditionally contradicting musical worlds, to boldly go where no metal band has gone before.\n\nEvolution requires visionaries. One of the biggest bangs of the modern metal universe happened in the fall of 2008.\n\nIt was the Finland-based label Spinefarm Records that took the proverbial cake. In April 2011 the band released their eponymous debut album to worldwide acclaim, charting high in Sweden and Finland. Right off the bat tapping the vein of the digital music revolution, AMARANTHE was the 84th most played album on Spotify in the whole world, all genres included. After 92 live shows in support of the eponymous debut, AMARANTHE returned to their creative home, Hansen Studios in Ribe, Denmark where the magic of the debut album was originally bottled.\n\nWith THE NEXUS album, released in March 2013, and its life cycle everything went up another notch: the album featured more of melodic / edgier metal, and even more brazenly techno-influenced hard rock. The release was followed by a longer tour.\n\nWasting no time, the band returned to Ribe to concoct another potion of power. Consequently, in October 2014 Spinefarm released the 3rd AMARANTHE outing, MASSIVE ADDICTIVE. The album also yielded AMARANTHE\u2019s first major single hit with \u201cDrop Dead Cynical\u201d.\n\nOne of the hardest working bands in the genre, the band released their 4th album MAXIMALISM already in October 2016.\n\nDeservedly revered as trailblazers of the genre, AMARANTHE, ever the visionaries, always seem to take the next bold step into realms unknown before anyone else does. AMARANTHE is the driving force of a modern metal revolution.\n\nWith their electrifying 5th album HELIX now on the brink of its release AMARANTHE take another leap in their sonic evolution. Their most focused work to date, Helix proves the band has refined their melodic sensibilities ever further whilst retaining their cutting-edge metal assault as massively aggressive as ever.\n\nNow, armed with an album with unprecedented crossover potential, AMARANTHE is ready to tear down the walls of musical separation.

Answering someone\u2019s questions about who you are has always seemed a strange way to approach the task of telling others about yourself and your life\u2019s mission. Because who knows you better than you do?\n\nIn order to alleviate that emotion of seeming vanity, I decided to take on the job myself.\n\nI was raised by people who found life hard and wonderful at the same time. A farm in central Kentucky is what I call my homeland. The tender shoots that sprang from my grandfather\u2019s carefully plowed rows were lessons about life. Planting, reaping, seedtime, and harvest, these are the bases of all of our existence, really. We planted each spring to make sure we survived the winter\u2019s dark days. Spiritually we are nothing if we are not farmers planting seeds for the Master\u2019s great wedding day harvest.\n\nWe celebrated the rain after weeks of drought, always decidedly giving glory to God for His provision.\n\nWe fed and housed ornery old Angus and Herford cows as if they were better than we were. We sweated through the heat of tobacco season and we prayed before every meal. We were fed on the baby food of \u201cevery good gift comes from the Father.\u201d As we matured, we graduated to the meat of \u201cthough He slay me, yet, I will praise Him.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, no one has ever asked me how I came to follow Jesus. Of course my parents and grandparents held my feet to each precept of Christianity, but just because that is so does not mean salvation for me. Actually, I was wooed. For years, I sat and listened to the congregational songs, and their gospel plucked strings in my heart. It was not until I went to youth camp that it became clear that I had to take part in my Savior\u2019s death by repentance. After camp, I did just that. There was not a parade. There were no fireworks. There were no flaming tongues falling at the front pew where I knelt. It was just Mrs. Davenport and me kneeling there. She prayed the words first, and I repeated them. I have repeated them in some fashion every day since. \u201cLord, forgive me for I am a sinner.\u201d After words that heavy, God does the great and awesome remaking of a human heart. Nothing is ever the same then. Thank God for that.\n\nThough I did not come from a musically literate family, music has always been a part of me. Each week my mother cleaned the small Baptist church where we attended. My job was to vacuum the never-ending sea of sanctuary carpet. Mom allowed me to take a turntable from our home and listen to records as I swept. At the time, I only owned two LP\u2019s. One I got from a mail order ad of Keith Green. The record was sent on a \u201cjust send what you can\u201d basis from Keith\u2019s ministry. \u201cSo You Wanna Go Back to Egypt?\u201d was the title. Keith impacted my life by allowing me to pay for the recording with what I had, which was $2.50. Another LP landed in my pile of two from God only knows where. It was The Gaither Trio recording called \u201cWe Are Persuaded.\u201d I would listen to that music for hours, and would often look at Gloria\u2019s smile. I remember being envious of their happy faces and locked arms as they skipped down the sidewalk together. I understood that music then, but understand it even more deeply now. \u201cBecause He Lives\u201d was on that recording. I swept, dusted, picked up discarded bulletins, and sang, \u201cI know who holds the future, and life is worth the living just because He lives.\u201d\n\nLast weekend I got off the Gaither\u2019s bus at the arena. I walked along side of Bill into the auditorium. He seemed to be skipping, and so I skipped along beside him. He stuck a microphone in my face on the last verse of Because He Lives and I sang as fine as I could sing. I think my arm made an involuntary sweeping motion.\n\nPlanting and reaping. Jesus planted in me. And still today, He is reaping what He has sown. Like Jesus, I am also a planter now. I plant the strange supernatural seeds of faith, love, mercy, forgiveness, trust, and joy\u2026 and I do it for the child who vacuums the auditoriums of life.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jon Cleary ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10363916.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "New Orleans Piano, New Orleans Funk And Groove, Funk", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Jon Cleary\u2019s love and affinity for New Orleans music goes back to the rural British village of Cranbrook, Kent, where he was raised in a musical family. Cleary\u2019s maternal grandparents performed in London in the 1940s, under the respective stage names Sweet Dolly Daydream and Frank Neville, The Little Fellow With The Educated Feet \u2013 she as a singer, and he as a crooner and tap dancer.\nAs a teen Cleary grew increasingly interested in funk-infused music and discovered that three such songs that he particularly admired \u2013 LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d Robert Palmer\u2019s version of \u201cSneakin\u2019 Sally Through the Alley,\u201d and Frankie Miller\u2019s rendition of \u201cBrickyard Blues\u201d \u2013 were attributed to Allen Toussaint as either the songwriter, the producer, or both. Cleary\u2019s knowledge of Toussaint\u2019s work expanded significantly when his uncle returned home to the U.K., after a two-year sojourn in New Orleans, with a copy of a Toussaint LP and two suitcases full of New Orleans R&B 45s.\n\nIn 1981 Cleary flew to New Orleans for an initial pilgrimage and took a cab straight from the airport to the Maple Leaf Bar, a storied venue which then featured such great blues-rooted eclectic pianists as Roosevelt Sykes and James Booker. Cleary first worked at the Maple Leaf as a painter, but soon graduated to playing piano there \u2013 even though his first instrument was the guitar, which he still plays and has recently reintroduced into his live performances.\nAs word of Cleary\u2019s burgeoning talent began to spread around town, he was hired by such New Orleans R&B legends as Snooks Eaglin, Earl \u201cTrick Bag\u201d King, Johnny Adams, and Jessie \u201cOoh Poo Pah Doo\u201d Hill, while also gaining the respect of the great Crescent City pianists Dr. John and the late Allen Toussaint. Years later, in 2012, Cleary recorded a critically acclaimed album of all-Toussaint songs entitled Occapella.\n\nToday, Cleary\u2019s work pays obvious homage to the classic Crescent City keyboard repertoire created by such icons as Jelly Roll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Dr. John, and James Booker \u2013 while also using it as a launching pad for a style that incorporates such other diverse influences as \u201970s soul and R&B, gospel music, funk, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Cuban rhythms, and much more.\n\nDeciding to stay in New Orleans, Cleary recorded his first album of nine, to date, in 1989.

Bergson doesn't do predictable, but there's a visible thread of blues awareness running through the fabric of everything he writes, sings and plays: he is a concise and subtle guitarist and tough, grainy singer.\" The Blues Magazine (UK)\n\nWith MOJO Magazine's #1 Blues Album of 2008, Fall Changes, #2 Blues Album of 2011, Imitate the Sun, #3 Blues Album of 2014, Live at Jazz Standard and #3 Blues Album of 2017, Bitter Midnight , New York guitarist/singer Chris Bergson has established himself as \"one of the most inventive songwriters in modern blues music\" (All Music Guide), creating his own blend of blues, roots and soul. Chris Bergson has performed and/or shared the stage with Hubert Sumlin, Levon Helm, B.B. King, Norah Jones, John Hammond, Etta James, and Bettye LaVette, to name just a few.\n\n2014 CD RELEASE: LIVE AT JAZZ STANDARD\nLABEL: 2 SHIRTS / INNSBRUCK RECORDS MEDIA\n\nLive at Jazz Standard, the latest CD release from the Chris Bergson Band, was recorded live over two nights at NYC's Jazz Standard with Bergson's usual four-piece band (organ/wurlitzer, bass and drums) \"augmented with a horn section expert in the snap and crackle of bluesy soul.\" (The Blues Magazine UK) The fifteen song CD contains eight brand new original songs from New York guitarist/singer Chris Bergson \"...one of the most inventive songwriters in modern blues music.\" (All Music Guide) as well as new arrangements of five older originals from the band's back catalog. According to iTunes Editors' Notes:\n\n\"A fair number of hot shot guitarists can lay down licks with presence and panache, but that number shrinks drastically when you tally the ones who are also sharp-shooting singer/songwriters. That\u00eds what makes Chris Bergson an unusual triple threat and this live recording shines a spotlight on the strength of his material as well as the alternately simmering and fiery feel that he and his band serve up in a club setting. New York City native Chris Bergson is a bluesman of a distinctly urban stripe. Instead of swamps and rivers, his songs - many penned in collaboration with lyricist Kate Ross - are full of citified imagery from the midtown Manhattan locale of \"61st & 1st\" to the Brooklyn scenes of \"Gowanus Heights.\" The three-man horn section accentuates the soul leanings of tunes like \"The Only One\" and brings out the R&B shadings in Bergson's gritty growl. At times, the blend of Bergson's earthy vocals and terse, biting guitar with Craig Dreyer's organ evokes The Band. Yet whether the guitarist and his group are venturing into R&B, roots rock or straight blues, they create an invitingly organic feel on a recording that clearly captures the band in their element.\"\n\nSpecial guests include soul singer Ellis Hooks and a three piece horn section featuring baritone saxophonist Ian Hendrickson-Smith (Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings), tenor saxophonist David Luther (Bettye LaVette) and Grammy Award-winning trumpeter Freddie Hendrix performing horn arrangements by Jay Collins (Gregg Allman).\n\nJazz Standard has been a musical home for the Chris Bergson Band for the past ten years and provided an ideal venue for their first live record. The album was recorded and co-produced by award-winning producer/engineer Roman Klun whose credits include albums by the Spin Doctors, Joan Osborne and the Holmes Brothers.\n\nBergson has had the opportunity to play with two masters of American music - drummer/singer Levon Helm of The Band and Howlin' Wolf's guitarist Hubert Sumlin - and their influence can be heard throughout the album.\n\nNotable past performances include:\nMoulin Blues (Holland), Groningen Rhythm and Blues Night (Holland), Blues Open (Holland), Noct en Blues (Chaumont, France), Blues in Hell (Norway), Harvest Time Blues (Ireland), Leicester Blues Festival (UK), Waterfront Blues Festival (Portland, OR), Saratoga Jazz Festival (NY), Levon Helm's Midnight Rambles (Woodstock, NY), River to River Festival (NYC), Joe\u2019s Pub (NYC), The Blue Note (NYC), Jazz Standard (NYC), John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (DC), SXSW, and opening for B.B. King at B.B. King's Blues Club (NYC).\n\nBorn in New York City but raised in Somerville, Massachusetts, Chris Bergson returned to Manhattan in\n1995. While backing jazz singers Annie Ross, Dena DeRose, Sasha Dobson and Norah Jones, he released\nBlues for Some Friends of Mine and Wait for Spring on Juniper Records in 1997 and 2000,\nrespectively. In 2002 Bergson was appointed a Jazz Ambassador of the USA by the John F. Kennedy\nCenter for the Performing Arts and he toured Africa with his trio. Evolving to further embrace the blues\nwhile also adding pop influences, he followed up with Blues (2003), Another Day (2005) and his\ntriumphant artistic breakthrough, the widely acclaimed Fall Changes (2007) -- MOJO\u2019s #1 Blues Album\nof 2008 -- that established him as an eloquent, evocative and lyrical songwriter with a sharp urban vision.\nRecorded at Levon Helm\u2019s Woodstock studio, it led to Bergson being personally invited to perform at the\nfamed drummer\u2019s Midnight Rambles while opening the way for more stateside festivals and subsequent\ntours of Europe.\n\nClick here to read Kay Cordtz's in-depth profile of Chris Bergson in ROLL Magazine:\nwww.rollmagazine.com\n\nChris Bergson currently serves on the faculty of NYC's 92Y where he teaches Rock, Blues and Jazz guitar and is the music mentor for the Recanati-Kaplan Scholarship Program.\n\nBergson endorses McCurdy Guitars and Levy's Leathers Gig Bags.\n\nSelected Press\n\n\"Gut-busting, horn-bedecked NY blues...

The group -- which is composed of vocalist Briton Bond, guitarist/vocalist Cody Quistad, guitarist Seth Blake, bassist Chris Gaylord and drummer Stephen Kluesener -- formed in Ocala, Florida, in 2013 and instantly started playing all over the area, quickly getting signed to Fearless Records the old fashioned way: By sending a song to the label. From there the group linked up with the production team of Andrew Wade (Neck Deep, Motionless In White) and A Day To Remember vocalist Jeremy McKinnon who produced their 2015 debut Blueprints together and returned to produce the sophomore full-length Deadweight, which the band started writing immediately after they finished their debut. \"I'm very proud of Blueprints but a lot of those songs were written seven years ago so who we are as people and musicians these days is drastically different,\" Quistad explains -- and a listen to Deadweight confirms that statement. \"I think a big strength of this new record is the continuity of sitting in a room together and playing instead of trying to send files back and forth,\" he continues. \"We were truly grinding out songs and I think this album still sounds like Wage War but at the same it has some of our most melodic moments as well as some of the heaviest.\" The latter is evidenced on songs like \"Stitch\" which is certain to incite frenzied mosh pits for years to come and displays an aggression that the band have only hinted at in the past. \"We really tried to not overthink things on this record and just do whatever worked for the song, even if it was something that people might not necessarily expect,\" Quistad says. For this reason the band decided it made sense to enlist the aforementioned producers who truly understood Wage War on a deep level. \"There were so many early mornings and late nights making this record and it was such a pleasure to work with Andrew and Jeremy again because you could tell that they really cared about it and would go to any ends to make it the best that it could be.\" From the explosive production to the alternately screamed and sung vocals of \"Don't Let Me Fade Away,\" all seven of the people involved in the making of TBA worked as one unit in working toward the same collective goal. Lyrically, Deadweight sees the band exploring both personal to political issues in a way that's as raw and honest as the music that supports them. \"This record is very much a snapshot of the past year; we are all very positive people but in 2016 we went through so much from seeing the world for the first time to scraping the bottom at some point emotionally or with relationships,\" Quistad admits. From 3 a.m. run-ins with refugees in Europe to flying home only to be confronted with the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, there was no shortage of content to draw from this time around. \"We didn't hold anything back when it came to this record, so hopefully it's as therapeutic for listeners as it was for us.\" In a heavy music scene that's increasingly formulaic, Wage War pride themselves on the fact that they listen to a diverse range of music. \"I'm a big fan of country music which surprises a lot of people and other guitarist Seth is really into pop music,\" Quistad explains. \"We have an appreciation for all kinds of stuff and I think that all of it bleeds into the album in some way even if it's not always blatant.\" Take the song \"Johnny Cash\" which recalls the country tradition of paying homage to a pioneer of a genre while still retaining the heaviness of the act. \"We get called metalcore a lot but we've never pledged allegiance to any genre because we always want to do something beyond that in the sense that we just listen to what we love and try to incorporate that into Wage War.\" More than anything though, the band can't wait to get back on the road and start playing the songs from Deadweight live. \"We played three hometown shows at the end of last year where we would include a new song and it was so cool to see the crowd react to the new material,\" Quistad says \u2013 and it's obvious that palpable excitement goes both ways. \"This album is the truest representation of Wage War in the sense that we wanted to put every part of us under the microscope and come up with something that we're not only proud of but also encompasses what we want to be as a band and the kind of musical statement we want to lay down,\" he summarizes. \"I would say this is a defining album for our band.\" Second album Deadweight featuring 'Witness' available now on Fearless Records.

The 26-year-old is home in her native Rochester, New York, reflecting on Delivery, her highly anticipated full-length album, as well as the hard journey the classically trained, defiantly original harpist had to travel to become the writer AND performer, she was meant to be.\n\n\u201cA lot of these songs came from feeling stuck and also like people were pulling me in a bunch of different directions,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cI wanted to say, \u2018Just wait for me. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nMikaela\u2019s plea for patience\u2013\u2013a little bit sweet, a little bit angry and raw\u2013\u2013fed a fierce 10-song collection. A joyride that pulls from rock, 70s and 80s pop, and funk, Delivery manages to be both daring and comfortable, full of not just risks, but hooks.\n\nProduced by Grammy winner John Congleton (St. Vincent, Angel Olsen, David Byrne, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah), Delivery is a triumphant next chapter. \u201cJohn tries to find that moment instead of the perfect take,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cThat made it all sound really special.\u201d Childhood friend Alex Cot\u00e9 (drums, percussion) and Shane McCarthy (bass) play on the record - already close from years of touring. Recently, Mikaela\u2019s ensemble became a family affair with the addition of Shane\u2019s older brother Cian McCarthy on guitar.\n\nMikaela\u2019s unconventional path to working songwriter began before high school, growing up in Rochester. With plans to join a symphony, she studied harp performance at Crane School of Music, but halfway through, she decided the traditional harpist\u2019s path wasn\u2019t for her. Following graduation, Mikaela moved to Brooklyn, following in the footsteps of artists who\u2019ve come before her. But in the city, she could never quite find her footing. She kept busy, toured, and recorded an album that would eventually be shelved. Feeling confused and alone, she retreated back to Rochester, unsure of her next move.\n\nThen, the last place Mikaela wanted to be saved her. Rochester\u2019s artistic community embraced her, encouraged by bandmates including Alex Cot\u00e9 and the group Joywave, she hit her stride. Rochester became Mikaela\u2019s sanctuary.\n\nDelivery benefits from it all. \u201cNow, these songs kind of wonder what I should be doing\u2013\u2013it\u2019s me trying to get myself back to why I started writing in the first place,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cWriting made me feel better and safe when the world around me was falling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust let my songs resonate with you somehow.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Michael League, producer for David Crosby, Susana Baca, Bokant\u00e9, and all 13 Snarky Puppy albums, walks (quickly) through each step of the production process from start to finish, taking a simple idea from an iPhone voice note and showing its progression all the way to the final master.

Fronted by self-confessed contrarian Phil Labonte, the band has experimented with a range of styles including pop, rock and caustic metalcore with just one objective \u2013 to create great songs that come straight from the heart.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always been to write songs that we like,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cAll That Remains has seen a lot of criticism about the songs that we\u2019ve written and what people think we\u2019re supposed to do. We started as a very underground death metal kind of band, we\u2019ve since moved away from that and have never apologized for it. The music we\u2019ve written has been reflective of that and I think the lyrics, the ideas, have always been reflective of that as well.\u201d\n\nAnd through it all, All That Remains have experienced considerable success. The band\u2019s last album 2015\u2019s The Order of Things reached #3 on the Billboard U.S. Hard Rock Albums chart and #5 on their Top Rock Albums chart. And to date, All That Remains have sold over a million albums Worldwide. The band has headlined across the world and played major festivals, including the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Fest.\n\nYet along the way, All That Remains have taken flak from just about everybody: extreme metal purists who accused the group of selling out, rock fans that don\u2019t get the screamy stuff, liberals who object to Labonte\u2019s right-of-center lyrics and conservatives that can\u2019t understand the singer\u2019s non-violent, Libertarian ways. Labonte\u2019s response \u2013 bring it on!\n\nMadness, All That Remains\u2019 eighth album, is the band\u2019s most musically eclectic, provocative release to date \u2013 full of undeniable hooks, incisive riffs, electronic samples and a variety of vocal styles. And, of course, the range of subject matter addressed pushes the band\u2019s limits further than ever.\n\n\"I don't mind if I piss off if it gets them to think about things. People know that I have strong opinions and I disagree with things. That's my whole deal.\"\n\nAs contrary as he wants to be, Labonte still values quality over confrontation. Madness, produced by Grammy award winning Howard Benson (Halestorm, Papa Roach, Chris Cornell), is All That Remains at their best, offering a level of accessibility and diversity lacking from much of today\u2019s hard rock and metal. The first single and title track, \u201cMadness,\u201d is a microcosm for the rest of the album.\n\nThe song starts on an experimental note with a barrage of amp static and the buzzing of ungrounded electricity accompanied by a sharp, simple drum intro. A pause later, the whole band kicks into gear, blending a propulsive rhythm with a kinetic groove that swings like a rope ladder in a thunderstorm. As the vocals enter, the guitars drop out, replaced by a delicate keyboard melody and electronic beats. Then, after Labonte sings, \u201cWhy should we escape ourselves? We are who we are in the end,\u201d the tone shifts back in a heavier direction, leading to a monster chorus more infectious than influenza.\u201d In true Labonte style, the tune is neither a love song nor a euphoric anthem about rocking out. \u201cIt\u2019s about socialism,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the repetition of bad ideas.\u201d\n\nOther songs on Madness are far more variegated. The leadoff track \u201cSafe House,\u201d which is about a man who lures robbers into his home and then kills them, is the heaviest track All That Remains has written since they played melodic death metal in the first half of the aughts. Driven by barreling beats, thrashy guitars, a crushing breakdown and metalcore screaming, the track pulverizes even as haunting keyboards and clanging percussion offer a brief respite from the jackhammer pounding.\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cFar From Home,\u201d which shifts between ringing acoustic guitars and forlorn vocals about being lost and alone, and a euphoric rock passage that shows that there\u2019s always light in the darkness.\n\nThroughout Madness All That Remains revisits the dichotomy between savagery and sensitivity. \u201cTrust and Believe\u201d contrasts double-bass drums, chugging riffs and melodic guitar licks with soaring guitar melodies and an anthemic chant-along chorus and \u201cHalo\u201d opens with a speedy electronic passage that sounds like a violin on hyper drive, then develops into a blazing number that balances melodic vocals with pain stricken howls.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted this record to be different,\u201d Labonte says,\u201d explaining the inclusion of electronic samples and the dramatic juxtaposition between roaring chaos and accessible craftsmanship. \u201cWe wanted to really push ourselves and push the boundaries of what we\u2019re allowed to do. We\u2019ve always pushed that envelope, but we wanted to push it more.\u201d\n\nAll That Remains started working on Madness in the spring of 2016, then in April Labonte flew from his home in Western Massachusetts to Los Angeles to start working on vocal melodies and lyrics with Benson. It was the first time the band didn\u2019t have fleshed out riffs and fully written rhythms to serve as guideposts for the vocals. At first, the process was difficult and the band members were uncomfortable, but the more they worked on the record the more excited they became about the way the songs were coming out. For the first time in years, they felt genuinely challenged and inspired to learn new ways to create.\n\n\u201cMe, Mike and Oli are the primary writers and we\u2019ve always written songs on guitars because we\u2019re all guitar players,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt was a totally different way to write songs. And I feel like it was really, really cool to do that because it gave us a fresh perspective. I\u2019d bring Mike and Oli the vocals and they\u2019d use what I had come up with to construct the riffs instead of the other way around.\u201d\n\nThe most difficult song for Labonte to create was \u201cRivercity.\u201d The song begins with a ringing telephone and progresses through an electronic beat, a melancholy, ballad-like guitar line and plaintive vocals. The track changes in intensity numerous times and injects various rhythm shifts before ending like it began. When he was working on \u201cRivercity,\u201d Labonte\u2019s then-wife was deployed in the Middle East in the Marines and the singer was left helpless at home while she risked her life on the front lines.\n\nWhile the title \u201cRivercity\u201d sounds like an innocent enough name for a song \u2013 the kind of title John Mellencamp might use about childhood memories -- for Labonte the term was very real and frightening. \u201cRivercity stands for \u2018reduced communications,\u2019 he explains. \u201cMe and my ex would be on the phone and she\u2019d be like, \u201cYo, the base is getting mortared. I gotta go.\u2019 If someone dies, they shut off communications until they can notify the families of the people that die. So we\u2019d be talking and she would say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to rivercity and hang up, and I wouldn\u2019t talk to her for three or four days and I wouldn\u2019t know what happened. The base is getting mortared. She might have taken a round or died. Being on the other end of that is agonizing.\u201d\n\nIntegrating excruciating personal experiences, political rants and controversial commentary with music that\u2019s just as confrontational, Madness is an unapologetic showcase of honesty and ingenuity. Inducing gentle head-bobbing one moment and inciting teeth-clenching fist pounding the next, All That Remains have created about 50 minutes of attitude-laden rock music. Pick a song: \u201cOpen Grave,\u201d their version of Garth Brook\u2019s \u201cThe Thunder Rolls,\u201d \u201cBack at You, \u201cLouder.\u201d There\u2019s something there to surprise, antagonize or incentivize.\n\n\u201cIf you ask someone, \u2018Is this what you expected?\u2019 It\u2019s always a \u2018no,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cAnd that makes me happy. Is anyone challenging what the listener expects anymore? We don\u2019t do stuff because we\u2019re supposed to.\u201d\n\nLabonte accepts he\u2019ll continue to be misunderstood. Some will love Madness, some won\u2019t, but the album will make an impression on everyone who gives it an honest listen. Asked how he\u2019d like to viewed, Labonte responds, \u201cI want to be the guy that really challenges people\u2019s ideas. I\u2019m fucking punk rock. Punk rock hasn\u2019t been punk rock for 30 years. For too long metal has been bullshit, milky pandering crap. What happened to metal? What happened to punk rock? What happened to being anti-establishment? I wanna bring that all back.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ Francis James ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9571757.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Progressive Trance, Electronica, Progressive House, Deep House, New Wave, Melodic House", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Francis James is an experienced DJ/Producer with over (25) years of industry experience.

But singer-guitarist Art Alexakis isn\u2019t about to start phoning it in now.\n\nAlthough the band hasn\u2019t released a new studio album since 2015\u2019s triumphant Black Is The New Black, Everclear continues to tour actively, in conjunction with a series of past-release anniversary dates and the annual Summerland Tour, which Alexakis created and has been running since 2012, featuring a rotating cast of \u201990s alt rock favorites. And while it\u2019s a virtual surety that no Everclear gig is complete without a rendition of \u201cSanta Monica\u201d and \u201cFather of Mine,\u201d lately the band has found that exploring the full range of past material\u2014especially the \u201cdeep cuts\u201d\u2014not only gives fans a rare treat, it also injects new life into the band\u2019s live dynamic.\n\n\u201cBy mixing it up and digging into the catalogue, it still makes it fun and relevant for us, and I think for the fans as well,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cIt\u2019s still important to play the hits, but by playing those other songs as well, it makes it all seem more vibrant and real. Even though I recorded some of those songs 20 years ago, I haven\u2019t played them in a long time, so it\u2019s like reinventing the wheel. I\u2019m having more fun now than I have in years. I think all of us are.\u201d\n\nFormed by Alexakis in 1991 in Portland, Oregon, Everclear has enjoyed a lengthy career spanning 11 studio releases, numerous videos, thousands of shows and accolades that include a 1998 Grammy nomination. Like a true survivor, Alexakis has soldiered on through multiple lineup changes over the years: During the \u201cclassic\u201d era, the band also included Craig Montoya on Bass and Greg Eklund on drums; the current touring lineup features longtime members Dave French (guitar) and Freddy Herrera (bass), as well as drummer Brian Nolan (also with American Hi-Fi), who has performed with Everclear on multiple past tours.\n\nThis incarnation of the band will hit the road for the 2018 Summerland Tour. As in prior years, Everclear will headline the latest installment of the festival, this time supported by Marcy Playground and Local H, and also featuring a special DJ set Alexakis will contribute, which honors the \u201990s in a refreshingly old-school way.\n\n\u201cThe Summerland Tours are all unique; they all have a different kind of feel to them,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cI think this year will be really cool, because it\u2019s usually guitar-based, but Marcy Playground is more acoustic-based, yet they still rock in their own way. Local H is just two guys, meanwhile, and they\u2019re great, too. So, it\u2019s just a different look at \u201990s alternative this year\u2026different facets of what it\u2019s about. With Everclear, we\u2019re going to play the hits we always play, but we\u2019re also going to mix it up. Every night will be a little different; there\u2019ll be a few surprises every show.\u201d\n\nFor Alexakis and Co., it\u2019s a continuation of a hectic couple of years. Everclear spent May and June of 2017 touring in honor of the 20th anniversary of So Much For The Afterglow, the band\u2019s massively successful sophomore major-label release. The 40-date run was an incredibly emotional and personally satisfying experience for Alexakis, who was able to perform obscure cuts from that time period for the first time in many years. Connecting with fans in that setting also reinforced the lasting impression the album has made.\n\n\u201cThe tour was phenomenal. It left me and the band stunned at how important that record was to so many people, and to be a part of that, both then and now,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cThe legacy of it is still vibrant for so many people. It was great just watching people react when we were playing not just the hits, but deeper songs on that record. I always liked the deeper songs\u2014they were usually my favorite songs\u2014and when the band would play those, it would be really exciting and important for me. That was fun, seeing that reaction, and just talking to people after the show.\u201d\n\nPrior to that, Everclear experienced a career resurgence thanks to 2015\u2019s Black Is The New Black, which not only proved the band could still rock, but also that Everclear remains creatively relevant, decades after their platinum years. As is common for many artists these days, Black didn\u2019t set records for traditional album sales, but the release did see significant streaming activity and sparked a heightened social media presence, putting the group firmly back in the listening public\u2019s mind. The band continues to ride this latest wave of interest.\n\n\u201cI personally think [Black] is one of the best records Everclear has ever made,\u201d Alexakis says. \u201cIt sounds like both old Everclear and new Everclear: It has a contemporary production sound, but it\u2019s just old-school, angry rock songs. It\u2019s kind of dark, very reminiscent of the early stuff. The sales weren\u2019t great on it, but a lot of people streamed it. It got millions and millions of streams, so people were listening to it, and it resonated.\u201d\n\nBut when you\u2019ve been a prolific band for more than a quarter-century, it\u2019s all part of the journey. Right now, Alexakis is feeling a reflective pull for the 25th anniversary of World Of Noise, the band\u2019s indie debut, which was recorded for $400 in a friend\u2019s basement in Portland. Although no official commemorative tour dates are confirmed as of this writing, Alexakis says he\u2019s considering playing some smaller, select shows this year as a tribute to the release. Much of the material rarely sees the light of day, but the 1993 album continues to enjoy a special place in Everclear history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d just had a baby, I was on public assistance and was working part-time jobs, I was very frustrated and very angry and there were a lot of emotions going on,\u201d Alexakis reflects. \u201cI made that record for $400, because that\u2019s all I had. I got this guy who had a basement studio to give me 40 hours\u2019 worth of recording at $10 an hour. We had 10 or 11 songs, so we went in and recorded them in a week and mixed them, and that\u2019s the album.\u2026From there we just hit the ground running. I still haven\u2019t stopped.\u201d\n\nThat rough and raw first attempt was just the nexus of the massive body of work Everclear and Alexakis have contributed since that humble beginning. When it comes to recording new material, at the moment Alexakis is focused primarily on writing and recording his first solo album, due out later this year. That precludes a new Everclear release\u2026for now.\n\n\u201cWe might make another record in a couple years,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe later on this year I\u2019ll feel like it. I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\nThat said, the band\u2019s live itinerary certainly makes up for its recent studio absence. As the group prepares for another Summerland run, as well as numerous other future dates, Alexakis is excited to revisit songs from fan favorite records like Afterglow, Sparkle and Fade and the double album Songs From The American Movie, but also compositions from more underrated collections, like 2012\u2019s Invisible Stars.\n\n\u201cThere are people asking for songs, so we\u2019ll just try and learn songs as we go,\u201d Alexakis says. \u201cIf we get a lot of response from people to play a certain song, we\u2019re going to learn it and go on the road and play it. You don\u2019t think, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t sing that high anymore.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to worry about it. We\u2019re going to play some rock n\u2019 roll, and just do it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Morat ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617187.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Eric Darius ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10367546.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Jazz, Contemporary Jazz, R&b, Funk, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Every now and then, an artist bursts onto the scene, changing the rules and challenging the status quo.

Fronted by self-confessed contrarian Phil Labonte, the band has experimented with a range of styles including pop, rock and caustic metalcore with just one objective \u2013 to create great songs that come straight from the heart.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always been to write songs that we like,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cAll That Remains has seen a lot of criticism about the songs that we\u2019ve written and what people think we\u2019re supposed to do. We started as a very underground death metal kind of band, we\u2019ve since moved away from that and have never apologized for it. The music we\u2019ve written has been reflective of that and I think the lyrics, the ideas, have always been reflective of that as well.\u201d\n\nAnd through it all, All That Remains have experienced considerable success. The band\u2019s last album 2015\u2019s The Order of Things reached #3 on the Billboard U.S. Hard Rock Albums chart and #5 on their Top Rock Albums chart. And to date, All That Remains have sold over a million albums Worldwide. The band has headlined across the world and played major festivals, including the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Fest.\n\nYet along the way, All That Remains have taken flak from just about everybody: extreme metal purists who accused the group of selling out, rock fans that don\u2019t get the screamy stuff, liberals who object to Labonte\u2019s right-of-center lyrics and conservatives that can\u2019t understand the singer\u2019s non-violent, Libertarian ways. Labonte\u2019s response \u2013 bring it on!\n\nMadness, All That Remains\u2019 eighth album, is the band\u2019s most musically eclectic, provocative release to date \u2013 full of undeniable hooks, incisive riffs, electronic samples and a variety of vocal styles. And, of course, the range of subject matter addressed pushes the band\u2019s limits further than ever.\n\n\"I don't mind if I piss off if it gets them to think about things. People know that I have strong opinions and I disagree with things. That's my whole deal.\"\n\nAs contrary as he wants to be, Labonte still values quality over confrontation. Madness, produced by Grammy award winning Howard Benson (Halestorm, Papa Roach, Chris Cornell), is All That Remains at their best, offering a level of accessibility and diversity lacking from much of today\u2019s hard rock and metal. The first single and title track, \u201cMadness,\u201d is a microcosm for the rest of the album.\n\nThe song starts on an experimental note with a barrage of amp static and the buzzing of ungrounded electricity accompanied by a sharp, simple drum intro. A pause later, the whole band kicks into gear, blending a propulsive rhythm with a kinetic groove that swings like a rope ladder in a thunderstorm. As the vocals enter, the guitars drop out, replaced by a delicate keyboard melody and electronic beats. Then, after Labonte sings, \u201cWhy should we escape ourselves? We are who we are in the end,\u201d the tone shifts back in a heavier direction, leading to a monster chorus more infectious than influenza.\u201d In true Labonte style, the tune is neither a love song nor a euphoric anthem about rocking out. \u201cIt\u2019s about socialism,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the repetition of bad ideas.\u201d\n\nOther songs on Madness are far more variegated. The leadoff track \u201cSafe House,\u201d which is about a man who lures robbers into his home and then kills them, is the heaviest track All That Remains has written since they played melodic death metal in the first half of the aughts. Driven by barreling beats, thrashy guitars, a crushing breakdown and metalcore screaming, the track pulverizes even as haunting keyboards and clanging percussion offer a brief respite from the jackhammer pounding.\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cFar From Home,\u201d which shifts between ringing acoustic guitars and forlorn vocals about being lost and alone, and a euphoric rock passage that shows that there\u2019s always light in the darkness.\n\nThroughout Madness All That Remains revisits the dichotomy between savagery and sensitivity. \u201cTrust and Believe\u201d contrasts double-bass drums, chugging riffs and melodic guitar licks with soaring guitar melodies and an anthemic chant-along chorus and \u201cHalo\u201d opens with a speedy electronic passage that sounds like a violin on hyper drive, then develops into a blazing number that balances melodic vocals with pain stricken howls.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted this record to be different,\u201d Labonte says,\u201d explaining the inclusion of electronic samples and the dramatic juxtaposition between roaring chaos and accessible craftsmanship. \u201cWe wanted to really push ourselves and push the boundaries of what we\u2019re allowed to do. We\u2019ve always pushed that envelope, but we wanted to push it more.\u201d\n\nAll That Remains started working on Madness in the spring of 2016, then in April Labonte flew from his home in Western Massachusetts to Los Angeles to start working on vocal melodies and lyrics with Benson. It was the first time the band didn\u2019t have fleshed out riffs and fully written rhythms to serve as guideposts for the vocals. At first, the process was difficult and the band members were uncomfortable, but the more they worked on the record the more excited they became about the way the songs were coming out. For the first time in years, they felt genuinely challenged and inspired to learn new ways to create.\n\n\u201cMe, Mike and Oli are the primary writers and we\u2019ve always written songs on guitars because we\u2019re all guitar players,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt was a totally different way to write songs. And I feel like it was really, really cool to do that because it gave us a fresh perspective. I\u2019d bring Mike and Oli the vocals and they\u2019d use what I had come up with to construct the riffs instead of the other way around.\u201d\n\nThe most difficult song for Labonte to create was \u201cRivercity.\u201d The song begins with a ringing telephone and progresses through an electronic beat, a melancholy, ballad-like guitar line and plaintive vocals. The track changes in intensity numerous times and injects various rhythm shifts before ending like it began. When he was working on \u201cRivercity,\u201d Labonte\u2019s then-wife was deployed in the Middle East in the Marines and the singer was left helpless at home while she risked her life on the front lines.\n\nWhile the title \u201cRivercity\u201d sounds like an innocent enough name for a song \u2013 the kind of title John Mellencamp might use about childhood memories -- for Labonte the term was very real and frightening. \u201cRivercity stands for \u2018reduced communications,\u2019 he explains. \u201cMe and my ex would be on the phone and she\u2019d be like, \u201cYo, the base is getting mortared. I gotta go.\u2019 If someone dies, they shut off communications until they can notify the families of the people that die. So we\u2019d be talking and she would say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to rivercity and hang up, and I wouldn\u2019t talk to her for three or four days and I wouldn\u2019t know what happened. The base is getting mortared. She might have taken a round or died. Being on the other end of that is agonizing.\u201d\n\nIntegrating excruciating personal experiences, political rants and controversial commentary with music that\u2019s just as confrontational, Madness is an unapologetic showcase of honesty and ingenuity. Inducing gentle head-bobbing one moment and inciting teeth-clenching fist pounding the next, All That Remains have created about 50 minutes of attitude-laden rock music. Pick a song: \u201cOpen Grave,\u201d their version of Garth Brook\u2019s \u201cThe Thunder Rolls,\u201d \u201cBack at You, \u201cLouder.\u201d There\u2019s something there to surprise, antagonize or incentivize.\n\n\u201cIf you ask someone, \u2018Is this what you expected?\u2019 It\u2019s always a \u2018no,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cAnd that makes me happy. Is anyone challenging what the listener expects anymore? We don\u2019t do stuff because we\u2019re supposed to.\u201d\n\nLabonte accepts he\u2019ll continue to be misunderstood. Some will love Madness, some won\u2019t, but the album will make an impression on everyone who gives it an honest listen. Asked how he\u2019d like to viewed, Labonte responds, \u201cI want to be the guy that really challenges people\u2019s ideas. I\u2019m fucking punk rock. Punk rock hasn\u2019t been punk rock for 30 years. For too long metal has been bullshit, milky pandering crap. What happened to metal? What happened to punk rock? What happened to being anti-establishment?

A choice of who you are, how you present yourself, and how you want to be remembered. And in the face of those daily choices \u2013 and ahead of the release of Upside Down \u2013 Set It Off has simply chosen to be more. More ambitious. More unified. More confident. More open-minded. More collaborative. And above all, more authentic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten stronger. We really have. As a whole. As a unit. We feel more together. When you go through struggle and you make it through, your bond strengthens. That\u2019s what Upside Down is about. That\u2019s the theme of this album. Going through struggle, and instead of taking it as defeat or a sign to give up \u2013 turning it into a positive and moving forward,\u201d declares Set It Off frontman Cody Carson. \u201cWe go through a lot every year, we\u2019re in the music industry, that\u2019s gonna happen. So we decided to band together, and just push forward.\u201d\n\nThe Tampa, FL-based band released Upside Down, their third full-length, on October 7th via Equal Vision Records. The album was recorded in Los Angeles, CA with producers Brandon Paddock (Panic! At The Disco, Avril Lavigne, Pentatonix), Erik Ron (Saosin, Panic! At The Disco) and Mike Green (5 Seconds of Summer, All Time Low, Cassadee Pope). The release was noted as one of the \u201cMost Anticipated Albums of 2016\u201d by Alternative Press Magazine and follows the band\u2019s sophomore album, Duality, which debuted at No. 18 on the Billboard Independent Chart, No. 81 on the Billboard Top Current Chart, and No. 86 on the Billboard Top 200 Chart; And the band\u2019s debut full-length, Cinematics, that was released in September 2012, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard South Atlantic Heatseekers Regional Chart, No. 4 on Billboard Heatseekers Chart, No. 9 on Billboard Next Big Sound Chart, No. 38 Independent Chart, and even broke into the Billboard Top 200 chart at No. 174. Set It Off formed in 2008 and is comprised of Cody Carson (vocals), Dan Clermont (guitar), Zach DeWall (guitar) and Maxx Danziger (drums).\n\nUpside Down sonically takes a brighter sound than previous releases and offers the band\u2019s most pop-driven anthems to date. Bold electronic elements guide loud, driving rock instrumentations with guitar riffs as catchy as the choruses and an overall feel-good, dance-worthy vibe throughout. On Upside Down, Set It Off commands attention and brings authenticity back to pop music in a bold and unapologetic way.\n\n\u201cI felt like a change was needed for Upside Down, so we decided to go back to our roots. Instead of focusing on what we think everyone else should hear from us or how they should perceive us, we went back to the roots of writing songs for the sake of wanting to write a good song. Opening our minds up to doing more co-writes and to collaborating more and just doing whatever it takes to chase that perfect song,\u201d he shares. \u201cAnd I feel like once we got out of our darker, more theatrical Cinematics era, writing became easier because we weren\u2019t inside of a box. So with Duality, the first time we started making the transition [to our roots], we started to open our minds to what Set It Off could become if we just didn\u2019t put any boundaries on ourselves and just wrote whatever came out of our minds and our hearts at that moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWriting Duality really showed me that a vibe is everything in writing. If I\u2019m excited and I\u2019m getting into it, then I\u2019m going to write better melodies. If I\u2019m feeling confident, I\u2019m going to write better melodies and have better ideas. I\u2019ve always heard that songwriting and producing is 99% confidence \u2013 and it\u2019s so true. Brandon [Paddock] brought out a writing side of us and a confidence that we\u2019ve never had. And I immediately became a better writer from that,\u201d notes Carson.\nDuality was our learning process of getting better and Upside Down is us \u2013 our system is on point now.\"\n\nDiscussing the band\u2019s hardships with people they\u2019ve worked with, how they\u2019ve coped with current events going on in the world, and reflecting on past personal relationships of past and present, Upside Down covers a wide spectrum lyrically \u2013 creating a dynamic and distinctly human experience. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s important to be honest, to be yourself. To me, I like how genuine the album is, I love the guys in my band because of the people they are and how real they are, and how real we are with everyone else. That\u2019s what I like with our connection with our fanbase too. And that\u2019s what I want people to take away from all of this...people just seeing us as people.

She\u2019s like the music scene\u2019s version of the protagonist in the film, \u201cThe Natural,\u201d having spent the \u201cprime of her career\u201d out of the spotlight -- in her case, tending to her family -- only to return from absolutely nowhere to wow and amaze. Where Robert Redford made all the fans sit up and cheer with mammoth home runs, Kerri Powers is going to make people listening to this album do the exact same thing with exceptional songwriting and equally exceptional delivery.\u201d -- Chip McCabe, Lonesome Noise\n\nKerri Powers was destined to be a musician from the start. While most kids her age spent their childhoods following frivolous pursuits, she spent hers reading, painting, writing stories, learning guitar and composing her first songs at the tender age of nine. By her own admission, she was a shy child, but her creative pursuits gave her an appreciation of the larger world around her. Those instincts seemed to have been bred naturally, given that there was undeniable talent embedded in her genes. Bing Crosby was a distant relative on her father\u2019s side, while her mother\u2019s relatives were said to be descended from author Herman Melville. Notably, too, Powers\u2019 paternal grandmother made her living by playing piano and providing musical accompaniment for silent films, making her a show business standby back in the day.\n\nNot surprisingly then, Powers was encouraged to pursue her own creative ambitions while still in adolescence. Her mother, a talented visual artist in her own right, owned an extensive record collection, which gave Kerri her initial exposure to irrefutable icons like Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and John Prine. \u201cI would sit in a wicker rocking chair by the record player and sing along to the songs,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI remember hearing John Prine\u2019s \u201cHello in There\u201d for the first time and feeling that something magical was happening. It was a momentary yet memorable trip to a sad but hopeful place of lonely old faces.\u201d\n\nPowers started playing professionally in local coffeehouses throughout her native New England and went on to release several well-received albums in the new millennium, culminating in Faith in the Shadows in 2009. Two of her songs were later featured on the Fox series \u201cRescue Me\u201d starring Denis Leary. After taking time off to get married and raise her young son she returned to performing, counting among her credits the Boston Folk Festival, Philadelphia Folk Festival, and Telluride Bluegrass Festival, among other prestigious gatherings. She\u2019s also toured Europe while opening for Canadian singer/songwriter Fred Eaglesmith in The Netherlands, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThis flurry of activity recently culminated in a new self-titled album, her first effort in five years. With a track list that includes eight searing self-penned songs along with incisive covers of Janis Ian\u2019s \u201cJesse,\u201d and The Bee Gees\u2019 \u201cTo Love Somebody,\u201d it ranks as Powers\u2019 most accomplished collection to date. \u201cThe recording was a last minute decision,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe idea was to cut a couple of tracks simply to see how it would go.\u201d\n\nThe results \u2013 a sound that\u2019s homespun, sparse and understated -- provide another ideal showcase for Powers\u2019 intimate and expressive songwriting, as well as her adroit ability to interpret the works of others.\n\nFully reenergized and excited about rebooting her career, Powers is looking forward to a return to touring both here and overseas. Clearly, the creative spark that was ignited so early on is fully fuelled once again.\n\nLee Zimmerman\n\nBooking Requests:\n\nNicholas DiSpagna/Airtight Management\n617-997-2131\nsilentgbooking@gmail.com\n\nEddie Camolli/ Hungry Ear Agency\n207-333-0281\nhungryearagency@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rye River Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9231579.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Americana", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "http://www.ryeriverband.com\n\nThe Rye River Band are a 5-piece live and recording band from Ireland.\nFormed in Leixlip Co.

The Going To Hell Tour sent The Pretty Reckless off on four separate jaunts across North America and three trips to Europe. Their explosive shows earned them legions of new fans at home and overseas. Despite feeling physically and emotionally spent after returning from their two-year odyssey, Momsen and Phillips jumped right into writing the songs for their third album, the scorching yet soulful Who You Selling For, which will be released by Razor & Tie in October. \u201cWe had so much we wanted to say, it was like shaking a can of soda on tour, and then when we started writing we cracked the seal,\u201d says Momsen. \u201cThe touring life is very isolating.

It saved us \u2014 again.\u201d The necessity of music as a balm for the soul is a theme that threads its way through Who You Selling For, which finds Momsen and Phillips dealing with emotions ranging from confusion and frustration to depression and despair. \u201cI think we felt a dire need to express those thoughts,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cAnd they\u2019re things I think most humans feel on a daily basis but don\u2019t always have an outlet to express. In the end we\u2019re saying, \u2018Don\u2019t give up, your soul is all you have, so you\u2019ve got to hang onto that.\u2019\u201d The album\u2019s opening track, \u201cHangman\u201d (which was inspired by a poem by Chidiock Tichborne written on the eve of his execution), tells a story of having control over your own mind and soul no matter what is happening to you. From there, Who You Selling For delves deep into the psyche of Momsen and Phillips \u2014 two artists who believe very much in the fiery redemptive power of rock and roll. The album\u2019s first single, \u201cTake Me Down,\u201d is a story of desperation, with Momsen delivering such lyrics as \u201cI spend all night and day / How much harder can I play? / You know I gave my life to rock and roll?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about wanting something so much you\u2019d sell your soul for it,\u201d Momsen says, adding that she and Phillips were inspired by blues artist Robert Johnson\u2019s song \u201cCrossroads,\u201d which some have interpreted as Johnson singing about selling his soul to the Devil in exchange for his musical ability. \u201cBack To The River\u201d is about the desire to get away from everything, to go where no one can reach you, while the strutting \u201cWild City\u201d is influenced by being young and on your own in New York (\u201cWe wrote it while walking down Rivington Street on the Lower East Side,\u201d Momsen says). The most aggressive song on the album is \u201cOh My God,\u201d which Momsen describes as \u201cself-confession right out of a journal. I think it speaks for itself.\u201d And finally \u201cWho You Selling For\u201d testifies to music being a form of salvation and describes how the rest of the album reaches into all forms of rock and roll looking for \u201cThe Answer.\u201d The song inspired the album\u2019s title, asking listeners to take a look at their own lives with its provocative query. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a question that challenges what I\u2019m doing with my life,\u201d Momsen says. \u201cIt questions the meaning of my actions whatever they are. It also defines the record in a grander way by asking the listener to look into the meaning of each song past the obvious.\u201d Sonically, Who You Selling For alternates between blistering hard rock (\u201cOh My God,\u201d \u201cPrisoner,\u201d \u201cWild City,\u201d \u201cLiving In The Storm\u201d) and gentler, more downtempo moments (\u201cThe Walls Are Closing In,\u201d \u201cTake Me Down,\u201d \u201cBack To The River,\u201d \u201cWho You Selling For,\u201d acoustic ballad \u201cBedroom Window,\u201d and closing track \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Back\u201d), giving Momsen a platform to showcase the power and versatility of her voice. She is one of rock\u2019s most compelling contemporary frontpersons, capable of being both brash and confrontational and sultry and seductive, daring listeners to ignore her at their own peril with a fiery swagger that has only grown more fascinating as Momsen gets older. (She was 15 when The Pretty Reckless wrote and recorded their rock-grunge-blues debut album Light Me Up, which was released in 2010.) Momsen\u2019s voice sounds all the more intimate thanks to the unvarnished way that she and Phillips, along with their long-time producer Kato Khandwala, recorded the songs. \u201cIt\u2019s the most natural recording possible,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cIt\u2019s all performance-based, nothing was fixed. If Taylor walked in and sang the song and it didn\u2019t work, she\u2019d walk right out.\u201d When more than just guitar, bass, and drums were needed, additional musicians were invited in, including guitarist Warren Haynes (Allman Brothers), guitarist Tommy Byrnes (Billy Joel), and keyboardist Andy Burton (Ian Hunter), as well as backing vocalists Janice Pendarvis (David Bowie), Jenny Douglas-Foote (P!nk), and Sophia Ramos (Rod Stewart). \u201cIt was so great having that many musicians in a room playing together and just hitting the record button,\u201d Momsen says. \u201cIt\u2019s very gratifying to feel the players and singers represented as they are. It gave life to these songs that were written tucked away in a bedroom and it enabled us to really deliver the most honest performances possible. What you hear is what it sounded like, no frills. That\u2019s it.\u201d It\u2019s the band\u2019s willingness to bare their souls that has earned them such a passionate fan base \u2014 people who identify with the raw candor of the lyrics and fearless way they are expressed. \u201cI\u2019ve had such a strange life,\u201d Momsen says. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt on my own, running around the world on some mission that I barely understood. Our fans have been the ones who were really there for us. They have supported us through the good times and the bad. I owe them gratitude. They are the inspiration when things look too bleak to keep going. I know it\u2019s been said a million times, but it\u2019s true, I wouldn\u2019t be here today without them.

After the Ted302 group disbanded in 1996, I headed to Europe with acoustic guitar in hand, as a solo performer, playing Ireland to the Czech Republic. My collection of original material from that period is found on my CD \"Go It Alone\".\n\nUpon returning home from the Czech Republic, I founded a Beatles Tribute group called The Sun Kings (2000 - present). I now get to be the voice of John Lennon in a successful tribute band (no caricature or dress up for us - just music). Talk about a coming around full circle! I also have a solo acoustic show called \"In The Spirit of Lennon\" and still another full band called \"Plastic Fauxno Band\".

Summoning a thrilling spirit, with throwback sonic crunch, visual flair, and reckless live performances, PALAYE ROYALE has quickly earned a legion of obsessive cult-like loyalists, lovingly dubbed Soldiers of the Royal Council. PALAYE ROYALE draw as much inspiration from cinema and philosophy as they do from their musical muses, building a story with libertine reverence for Alan Watts and debauchery-fueled nights at the Chateau Marmont, for Johnny Thunders and The Stooges. This band is equally at home in the hallways of Los Angeles Fashion Week or climbing the lighting tresses at the Vans Warped Tour. They sold out theaters on their first-ever headlining tour and steal the show at each major festival.\nEach member of PALAYE ROYALE doubles as musician and visionary. The Pirate, The Vampire, and The Gentleman inspire a level of devotion reserved for My Chemical Romance or Twenty One Pilots, as their deep fan connection crosses genre-divides.\nKerrang! declared the band to be \u201con the cusp of next-level stardom\u201d and with good reason. PAYALE ROYALE went from support act on any tour that would have them to the cover of Rock Sound and Alternative Press. \u201cMorning Light,\u201d \u201cMr. Doctor Man,\u201d \u201cGet Higher,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Feel Quite Right,\u201d and \u201cMa Ch\u00e9rie\u201d amassed 30 million YouTube views (and counting). Boom Boom Room (Side A) paved the way for this year\u2019s hotly- anticipated follow-up, Boom Boom Room (Side B), heralded by the arrival of the overnight smash lead single, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Fine.\u201d PALAYE ROYALE brought the juxtaposition of the glitz and grime of their teenage years spent in Las Vegas, when they relocated to Los Angeles in 2011. The ghost of Charlie Chaplin was surely some sort of unseen guide as they took up residence in his old home and rehearsed continuously in a basement. By the time they hit the road, borrowing their mother\u2019s Cadillac Escalade, Remington Leith, Sebastian Danzig, and Emerson Barrett were a tightly wound creative force. (Not long ago, they slept in that SUV outside a Motel 6, unable to afford to rent a room.)\nIt was Alex Burdon, daughter of The Animals singer Eric Burdon, who insisted Sumerian\u2019s founder see the band. (The label offered them a contract the same night.) Los Angeles radio personality and tastemaker Rodney Bingenheimer introduced PALAYE ROYALE to rock industry legend Kim Fowley, another strong supporter. James Iha of The Smashing Pumpkins/A Perfect Circle and Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour also count themselves among the band\u2019s true believers, having worked with them as a producer and taken them out on tour, respectively. Sleeping With Sirens\u2019 Kellin Quinn made a guest appearance on Boom Boom Room (Side A). As their moniker itself evokes (Palaye Royale is the name of the Toronto dancehall where their grandparents met in the \u201850s), the brotherly trio is eager to connect themselves and this generation to the spirit of the past, but reinvigorated for today with eclecticism and fierce individuality. Their tours are like a traveling circus. Clad in scarves, hats, paisley shirts, and makeup, as the Soldiers of the Royal Council attest, it\u2019s the PALAYE ROYALE lifestyle. Gretsch guitar tones that shimmer with reverb, drums that shake and pound, vocals that claw forth with the electric urgency of the early punk movement, all swirling together with the swinging cool of the 1960s and the swagger of latter day Brit Pop bands such as The Libertines and early Arctic Monkeys. Each show comes with an element of unpredictability and danger, with the three guys playing as if their lives depended on it, pure showmanship over perfectionism.\nAs Classic Rock Magazine wrote, \u201cIf you want theatrics, these boys deliver in spades \u2013 and not just in their headline-grabbing threads and eye-popping stage show.\u201d The Rolling Stones, The Black Crowes, and The Doors collide with The Ramones and Iggy Pop within their songs, with a hint of the early blues that inspired Led Zeppelin. It\u2019s fast-paced dirty rock n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s glam and grime, spectacle and sweat, showmanship and songwriting. Rock Sound\u2019s in-depth cover story, drawn from an intense 72-hours with the brothers, called PALAYE ROYALE \u201cRock\u2019s Next Superstars,\u201d predicting they \u201cmight just change it all.\u201d Even as 2016\u2019s Boom Boom Room (Side A) and 2018\u2019s Boom Boom Room (Side B) document the story thus far, PALAYE ROYALE remain focused on the bigger picture. They\u2019ve built something grander than a band. It\u2019s an artistic movement. Ever self- assured in their ambition and staunch in their support of individuality, PALAYE ROYALE are \u201coutfitting the revolution\u201d (as they like to say).", "otherInfo": "We'll be performing live at Homeschool Festival on Saturday, May 9th at 8:25pm BST (12:25pm PT/3:25 ET) on the Alt Stage!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Jive Aces ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9160947.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Jazz, Rockabilly, Trad Jazz, Blues, Jazz Blues, Jive, Swing, Skiffle", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The UK's No.1 jive and swing band, more info at http://www.jiveaces.com/meet-the-band", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/jiveaces"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Crystal Skies ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9928074.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electronic Dance Music, Electronic", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Melodic Bass Music.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.twitch.tv/cardinalnow"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chord Overstreet ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10190624.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Chord Overstreet has a '50s pin-up style in a 2019 setting.

A series of conversations between the two revealed a mutual love for the Truck Drivin' Country of Red Simpson, Del Reeves, and Dave Dudley. A few impromptu rehearsals later and The 18 Wheelers were born.\n\nInitially serving as a great excuse to play their favorite trucker anthems and country classics, The 18 Wheelers soon evolved into a showcase for Zephaniah's original material. Assimilating a world-class band of musicians and a dozen songs that harken back to the golden age of country music, 'This Highway' is an album that gives a reverent nod to the past before blazing a brand new interstate through the gridlock of contemporary country. By combining the brash edge of Bakersfield and the slick sonority of the Nashville Sound, Zephaniah Ohora with the help of The 18 Wheelers have forged a new brand all their own.

The music achieved critical acclaim and airplay across the country and into the US and even Europe. The first single from that album, \u2018Come Right Back To You\u2019 debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul song chart at #23, while the album itself debuted at #11 on the Canadian iTunes Top 200 RnB/Soul chart.\n\nThe success of \u2018My Heart Away\u2019 led to the interest and attention of one of House music\u2019s hardest working artists from Sweden, StoneBridge. The Grammy award-nominated artist, Producer, and DJ has shared his talent on Billboard #1 hits for major artists like Ariana Grande, P!nk, Haley Joelle, Nelly Furtado & many others. One particular song from Avery\u2019s album, \u2018Pieces\u2019, captured the dynamic producer\u2019s imagination and \u2018Pieces \u2013 The Remixes\u2019, released in January 2020, with its already infectious melody and catchy hook, is being played in dance clubs and on dance radio all around the world. In fact, the song debuted on the Billboard Dance Club Song Chart at 50* and has quickly moved within the top 40, widening the appeal of this independent Canadian artist.\n\nThat achievement is merely one of many successes from this teenaged Contemporary Soul/Pop phenomenon. In fact, Canadian, recording artist Avery Raquel, started in the entertainment industry at a very young age. From television, for the likes of DreamWorks, to animation for Disney, voice-over work, commercials and radio, as well as a number of professional stage productions across Canada, Avery\u2019s passion for performing grew. All the while, Avery kept honing her craft as a vocalist of rare talent, which has led to an impressive list of career-accomplishments on her musical resume.\n\nThat talent caught the ears of award-winning Canadian producer/songwriter/musician Greg Kavanagh, in 2017, and their eventual collaboration of work has led to outstanding original songs that not only were featured on \u2018My Heart Away\u2019, but also on her second solo album, \u2018Without A Little Rain\u2019. That album debuted on the iTunes Canada Top 200 RnB/Soul album chart at #31.\n\nBeyond acquiring media attention, Avery\u2019s music consistently receives glowing reviews and continued airplay across Canada, and into the United States, affording her opportunities to perform her music across North America. From New York to Newport to Toronto and beyond, including venues and renowned music festivals, Avery continues to wow audiences with her fresh style and powerful vocal performances.\n\nAvery is compassionate as well, volunteering her time to regularly perform at sports, government, and charity events, donating her talents. She\u2019s even sung the anthem in front of 43,000 people at a Toronto Blue Jays Baseball game.\n\nOf course, she also has a passion for supporting causes close to her heart such as anti-bullying (going into schools talking and performing for students), and music education. To that extent, Heart of Indie Radio in the US, has named a scholarship in her honour. That scholarship, every year for the next 10 years, awards an individual in Canada, and one in the United States, with $500 USD towards their arts or music education.\n\nAvery continues to compose new music, challenging herself to appeal to multiple genres and audiences, and constantly performing and improving her craft.

During that year she auditioned for the Staten Island Gospel Fest and became a finalist and was honored to minister to folks from across the tri-state area. That same year, coordinators at WIADCA, a notable \u201csecular\u201d Caribbean organization that furnished scholarships to youngsters in addition to taking part in the Labor Day festivities in NYC invited Serious as the first and only female Christian rapper to perform on the Brooklyn Museum stage for the WIADCA GospelFest.\nSerious released Are You Serious Vol 1 in January 2012. The mixtape was available on all major Christian hip hop sites and Datpiff, garnering over 11k downloads.\nIn August of 2012, Serious was nominated as Female Rap Minister by the Kingdom Choice Awards Committee. Since the nomination, she has successfully toured various parts of Texas with her SAAB message, touching the hearts of women by simply testifying and sharing her music.\nNow under the label Serious PPL Music, which is headed by Christopher James, Serious continues to tour and do local and national shows.

With their joint album called \u2018Togetherr\u2019, Rodg and Ruben de Ronde emerged with a body of work that serves as a testament to their consistent high-quality output and became Mixmag\u2019s \u201calbum of the month\u201d with a 9 out of 10 rating.\n\nOn the live front, the Rodg sound has become inseparable from Armin van Buuren\u2019s live sets and the Dutchman himself has since brandished his own sonic blend at A State Of Trance shows in Utrecht, Ibiza, and Mexico, Armada Nights, and various other unforgettable shows at H\u00ef Ibiza, Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival and more.

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage. Whether Love Saves The Day makes one dollar or a million isn\u2019t a big concern to him. It stands as a huge success because he made the gritty, honest album that he intended by \u201ckeeping it raw, keeping it immediate, keeping it real.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that he has honed over the years: \u201cbe original and be true to what you do.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To Benefit Music Farm, Charleston"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alyssa Bonagura ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6905006.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Country, Americana", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A fixture on Nashville's Indie singer-songwriter scene - Rolling Stone\n\nStunning, Original, A Future star in the making. - Robin Gibb\n\nOne listen and it becomes crystal clear that Alyssa Bonagura was born to make music. With a voice that touches somewhere deep inside, Alyssa\u2019s soulful sound and powerful lyrics will send you jet-setting into a broad range of human emotions. Growing up on the open roads of America, with her RCA country recording artists parents, Baillie & The Boys, made it impossible for Alyssa not to witness the power and magic of music. At just 3 weeks old, her cradle was the gentle rocking of a tour bus. Her play ground encompassed sound checks at fairs and festivals and back stage dressing rooms at a slew of different venues including the Grand Ole Opry and Country Music Award shows, and her \u201cextended family\u201d consisted of managers, promoters, roadies, musicians and other fellow mainstream country artists.\n\nAt the age of 3, Alyssa performed on the Ralph Emory television show, Nashville Now. Where her version of the Leslie Gore classic; It\u2019s My Party brought the house down in front of millions of national viewers. At age 10, one of those major acts, Kenny Rogers, decided Alyssa was the perfect child singer to record a duet with him on his Christmas CD, Christmas From The Heart. By age 13, Alyssa had her first batch of songs written and received an endorsement from Gretsch Guitars. She had figured out her own unique style of guitar playing with open tunings inspired by Joni Mitchell. By age 16 she landed her first 50 date tour opening up for Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives. It soon became obvious that she was the real deal, not only as a musician and singer but as a prolific songwriter as well.\n\nWhile in high-school, Alyssa became a go-to session singer for people like Christian artist Matt Maher, where she created her own layered harmony vocal approach from years of hearing her parents sing together. Her songs started finding their way into television shows, (Switched! on ABC Family, MTV), movies, as well as getting her first cuts on other artists projects.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Alyssa received a full scholarship from Sennheiser to Paul McCartney\u2019s Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts in Liverpool England, where she would spend the next three years earning a degree in Sound Technology while continuing to perform in local venues throughout Europe. While playing at a venue called The Zanzibar in Liverpool, Alyssa was spotted by Liverpool Rock Star Pete Wylie and was asked to join his band playing electric guitar and singing background vocals. Alyssa of course said yes, and experienced what most artists never experience; a private performance requested by the Queen to help support one of Liverpool\u2019s local charities. A performance with Ringo Starr at the 800th Anniversary of Liverpool\u2019s, \u201cCapital Of Culture 2008\u201d event; a performance slot at one of the UK\u2019s largest music festivals; Knowsley Hall on the same bill as The Who, and from there on scored her own slots performing on the Acoustic stage at Glastonbury in 2009, and a UK tour opening for Raul Malo of The Mavericks.\n\nWhile at LIPA, Alyssa was inspired by their music community and the extreme amount of talented people attending the school. She lived in Lennon Studios, an apartment complex that used to be the old maternity ward where John Lennon was born. Her incredibly unique experiences abroad inspired her debut album, The English Diaries, an all acoustic intimate collection of songs she produced and recorded herself in her one bedroom Beatles inspired flat.\n\nAfter graduating LIPA and receiving her diploma from Paul McCartney himself, Alyssa returned to Nashville and signed her first publishing deal with Rondor Music. While signed to Rondor, she produced and released her sophomore album Love Hard which was backed by a 10k dollar Kickstarter Campaign and landed one of the biggest nationwide commercial placements of 2012 with her song, \u201cI Make My Own Sunshine,\u201d inspired by Liverpool\u2019s rainy weather. It was featured in a Lowe\u2019s commercial, earning over 50,000 downloads in its first 3 months and over 1 million plays on Spotify. She had no idea at the time that her song would later be heard by Steven Tyler and recorded on his first ever solo album, We\u2019re All Somebody From Somewhere and that she would be the only solo writer on his debut #1 billboard Country album.\n\nAlyssa\u2019s many other accomplishments in the singer/songwriter community include: Writing with Jeffrey Steele, Michelle Branch, Hunter Hayes, and JD Souther, writing three songs on Jessie James Decker\u2019s top 5 Billboard Country album \u201cComin\u2019 Home\u201d and co-writing top 40 billboard country radio single, \u201cLights Down Low\u201d, winning Canadian songwriter of the year and song of the year for \u201cI Only Smoke When I Drink\u201d by the Small Town Pistols, co-writing Jana Kramer\u2019s latest country radio single \u201cCircles\u201d and a #17 AC Billboard Chart Christmas duet with Matthew & Gunner Nelson called \u201cThis Christmas\u201d which she wrote with the twins and her father, Michael Bonagura. She\u2019s also had three #1 hits in Australia with Morgan Evans and Chelsea Basham and produced music for Jo Dee Messina & Rachel Reinert of Gloriana.\n\nAt 28 years old, Alyssa has become a songwriting seamstress for a number of artists, a producer, and a band member of the west coast folk & classic rock n\u2019 roll sounds of The Sisterhood Band with friend Ruby Stewart, all while simultaneously having a career as a solo artist. She\u2019s created life long friendships with fellow songwriters, artists and musicians, and has been called \u201cA fixture on Nashville\u2019s indie singer-songwriter scene\u201d by Rolling Stone. It\u2019s been over 4 years since she\u2019s released a solo project, but when you hear her newest record Road Less Traveled, you\u2019ll know it was worth the wait.\n\nAfter an entire summer of recording plans with an outside producer had fallen through, Alyssa turned to her boyfriend Graham Whitford for guidance on what was the best way forward for the songs she so much believed in. They decided to call long time friend and engineer Mark Petaccia to see if he was available to help record at his studio Petti Sound in Berry Hill. By a simple twist of fate, he had 7 days free.\n\nHer closest friends and family who are all a part of the Nashville underground music community decided to come together and help her create Road Less Traveled without the help of a label and purely for the love and support of their friend. The entire album was recorded live, produced by Alyssa & Mark Petaccia, Mastered by Richard Dodd and executive produced by Karen Whitford. Alyssa showcases her multi-instrumental talents by playing acoustic guitar in her signature open tunings, Piano, Ukulele, Lap Steel, Electric guitar, Bass, B3 and Harmonica. She\u2019s backed by Graham Whitford, Caleb Crosby, and Noah Denney (3/4ths of Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown), String arrangers and players Eleonore Denig and Molly Cherryholmes (Mountain Heart), Kevin McGowan, Tarka Layman, fellow artist and songwriter Davis Naish, and her father Michael Bonagura on Electric guitar.\n\nRoad Less Traveled showcases Alyssa as a solo artist in her truest form to date and shares the journey of finding her own voice and paving her own path as an independent Country artist. It encompasses elements of early Sheryl Crow mixed with Joni Mitchell like vocals. You'll hear so many iconic female influences on this project. Alyssa blends them all extremely well to come up with a sound that is familiar in its harkening back to the greats from multiple decades, yet completely unique and unlike anything else one would hear today. Road Less Traveled comes out for pre-order 8.19.16 and will be available 9.23.16.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Guitar Mash ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9837672.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "To contribute what we can for collective sanity and joy, Guitar Mash is thrilled to announce #HomeMadeMusic, a series of Virtual Campfires.

Singer. Banjo player. Ashley Campbell juggles all three roles, armed with the ability not only to dream up a modern country song, but to deliver it, too.\n\nAlready known for her work alongside her father, country legend Glen Campbell \u2014 who, during his final years as a touring musician, leaned heavily on his youngest daughter as a banjo player, keyboardist and harmony vocalist \u2014 Ashley is now stepping out on her own. Her music is a mix of her wide-ranging influences, combining the old-school country sound popularized by her fa-ther during the '60s and '70s with contemporary Americana, rootsy folk and country-pop. Glen Campbell's longtime fans may hear something familiar in Ashley's melodies as she embraces these similarities while distinguishing herself as a talented frontwoman.\n\nGrowing up, Ashley's parents encouraged her to sing and play the piano. She did both, adding the acoustic guitar to the mix once she hit high school. A theater kid with comedic chops, she also landed roles in local musicals and improv groups, eventually heading to college as a theater major during her late teens. When a director cast Ashley in a role that required her to learn the banjo, though, she fell in love with the instrument. Inspired, and with the help of her godfather, legendary banjo player Carl Jackson, she began mastering her banjo technique, then started writing her own songs. No wonder Glen asked her to join him on his farewell tour not long after she graduated college, a tour that would eventually take his band \u2014 Ashley included \u2014 on a three-year ride around the world. The banjo sounded timeless, reminding her of the music she'd heard as a child.\n\nAshley kept writing new material during her days on the road. By the time her father retired from touring in 2012, she was ready to make her introduction not only as a sideman, but as a solo art-ist in her own right. Dot Records, an imprint of the Big Machine Label Group, was ready, too, signing Ashley to a roster that also includes Maddie & Tae, Steven Tyler and Drake White. She is currently working on her debut record. All of the tracks \u2014 including \"Remembering,\" a poignant tribute to her Dad that doubled as the first single of her career \u2014 were either written or co-written by Ashley, who also played multiple instruments throughout the recording process. The goal wasn't to create a perfect-sounding album featuring the best session musicians from Nashville. The goal was to be authentic and real, shining a light on a do-it-yourself artist who's carved out her own sound.\n\nAshley Campbell is a multi-talented entertainer. A singer and songwriter who plays her own in-struments. A newcomer with years of heavy touring under her belt. There's no denying her icon-ic country pedigree, but Ashley is attracting the spotlight these days with her style, talent and a unique sound all her own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Casey Wickstrom ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8746622.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Blues-rock, Acoustic, Singer-songwriter, Slide Blues, Looping Artist, Acoustic Blues", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Casey Wickstrom is a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist looping artist based in San Jose, California.

The Army of Broken Toys's stage show exorcises personal tragedies and cleaves its audience's hearts with rollicking apocalyptic waltzes and powerful rock ballads that seem to emerge from under their ringmaster Walter Sickert\u2019s top hat. While The Toys are on stage one feels psychically kidnapped to their \u2018Portable Carnival\u2019. The WIREFOREST boasts 7 musicians (guitars, upright bass, drums, viola, mandolin, broken toys, melodica, accordion, ukulele, flute...) and rolls with a surreal troupe of any number of midway and burlesque performers, The Bunny Collaborative. The Army of Broken Toys offers a unique rock club run-away to the circus experience.\n\nWalter Sickert & The Army of Broken Toys have been making as much noise nationally as they do locally. With a steady foundation of coverage by Boston press including The Boston Globe, The Boston Herald, the Noise and The Phoenix; the Army of Toys has also been featured nationally on NPR\u2019s Here and Now, All Songs Considered and on MuchMusic. Walter Sickert was named Best Artist 2011 and 2012 in the Boston Phoenix Reader's Poll and his visual art was part of the Art is Evil touring stage/music/art show and art book sponsored by Amanda Palmer\u2019s million dollar Kickstarter with a small group of artists like Frances Bean Cobain, Neil Gaiman, DJ Spooky, Shepard Fairey, David Mack etc. Walter has also been featured for the last six years as a part of the RPM challenge sponsored by New Hampshire\u2019s The Wire. The band has continued to participate in the challenge every year since its inception. The Toys have successfully funded two Kickstarter campaigns, and produced a 40+ show run of their original 'steampunk musical for people who hate musicals,' \"28 Seeds\" a cautionary tale for our time writ by the band's resident playwright/mustache, Meff and produced by Liars and Believers. The play originated from the \"last radio show\" RPM '10 project.\n\nThe \u201crollicking, raunchy sideshow of jolly, wheezing menace and delight\u201d live experience of Walter Sickert & The Army of Broken Toys have taken the band across the US and beyond, playing such revered venues as the Hynes Convention Center for First Night for four years, The Boston Center for The Arts, Boston Symphony Hall, 930 Club in DC, Webster Hall in NYC, Royce Hall in LA, Mod Club in Toronto, the Stone Pony in NJ, and the Melkweg in Amsterdam etc. Their live antics have earned them a Boston Music Award nomination for Best Live Act and headlining spots at Steampunk World\u2019s Faire. They have garnered opening spots alongside international contemporaries the Tiger Lillies, Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys, The Humans (featuring Toyah Wilcox, Bill Rieflin and Chris Wong), The Dresden Dolls, Amanda Palmer (solo), Chester French, etc. at several venues.\n\nWith their newest album, Soft Time Traveler and tour plans in the US and Europe, there is so much more to come from the BRoken TOys!\n\n\n(((((((((THE PRESS MONSTER))))))))))))\n\n\u201cThrough it all, Walter Sickert anchors the performance pounding out strong melodies and baying these fierce, fuming lyrics and damn if it doesn\u2019t come off as revelry...

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s positive or optimistic or whatever, but that's what's going on with me.\u201d\n\nBrendan Benson finds himself in an enviable spot as he enters the third decade of a remarkably creative, consistently idiosyncratic career \u2013 an accomplished frontman, musician, songwriter, producer, band member, husband, and dad. Benson\u2019s seventh solo album, and first new LP in almost seven years, DEAR LIFE is this consummate polymath\u2019s most inventive and upbeat work thus far, an 11-track song cycle about life, love, family, fatherhood, and the pure joy of making music. Produced and almost entirely performed by Benson at his own Readymade Studio in Nashville, the album sees the Michigan-born, Nashville-based artist \u2013 and co-founder, with Jack White, of The Raconteurs \u2013 reveling in a more modernist approach than ever before, fueled by a heady brew of cannabis, hip-hop, and a newly discovered interest in software drum programming. The result is an untapped playfulness that elevates expertly crafted songs like the opener, \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d and the first single, \u201cGood To Be Alive,\u201d with voluble arrangements, elastic grooves, and incandescent power. Imbued with revitalized ambition and confidence, DEAR LIFE is Brendan Benson at his very best.\n\nBeginning with his now-classic 1996 major label debut, ONE MISSISSIPPI \u2013 recently reissued by Third Man in its first-ever vinyl pressing \u2013 and its masterful 2002 follow-up, LAPALCO, Benson has always infused classic craftsmanship with contemporary invention. Along with his own critically acclaimed canon, Benson is of course co-founder \u2013 with Jack White, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler \u2013 of The Raconteurs. The band first convened in 2006, winning worldwide acclaim, GRAMMY\u00ae Award nominations, and a chart-topping smash single in \u201cSteady As She Goes,\u201d with their now-classic debut album, BROKEN BOY SOLDIERS. The Raconteurs returned two short years later with 2008\u2019s CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY. Like its predecessor, the LP proved a popular and critical phenomenon, earning the GRAMMY\u00ae Award for \u201cBest Engineered Non-Classical Album\u201d as well as a nomination as \u201cBest Rock Album.\u201d\n\nDEAR LIFE came about gradually and organically after a self-imposed creative hiatus rooted in the happy arrival of his son and later, a daughter. Having spent the majority of his adult life on the road, Benson decided he\u2019d prefer to stay home for a change and just be a dad.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so enamored with my kids, I just sort of lost touch with my career. I just didn\u2019t want to go back to work.\u201d\n\nInstead, Benson directed his musical energies elsewhere and fast proved an in-demand producer/engineer (Robyn Hitchcock, Young The Giant, Trapper Schoepp, The Greenhornes) and collaborative songwriter, with a CV that includes partnerships with Jake Bugg, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), and The Kooks\u2019 Luke Pritchard, among others. Despite his successes, after a few years in this voluntary wilderness, Benson surprised himself in 2017 by writing and recording the rocker \u201cHalf A Boy (And Half A Man).\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was like born again. Seriously, it was almost a religious experience, like, oh my God, I love making music. I had forgotten. That\u2019s how it started. It was kind of a spark. A re-ignition.\u201d\n\nThough Benson wasn\u2019t \u201cconsciously making a record,\u201d the songs kept coming. Rather than overthink every move, he simply let go. He got stoned in his studio and worked on music simply because it made him happy.\n\n\u201cI started dreaming again,\u201d Benson says. \u201cGetting lost in the music and just letting it take me. Not being so serious, not thinking I was some sort of great writer or producer. I just enjoyed myself. I wasn\u2019t racking my brain on how to from one chord to the next. I wasn\u2019t trying to come up with the best lyrics ever. I was just having fun.\u201d\n\nBenson worked with surprising intensity, most days skipping meals until long after dark. Determined to keep moving forward, he opted to play virtually every instrument on his own. Though a skilled drummer in his own right, Benson began working with Pro Tools and an array of other drum programming software.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-taught only child,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go elsewhere for things. If I want drums, I think, OK, how do I create drums? Well, I\u2019ve got to play them or I\u2019ve got to program them. It\u2019s all happening really quickly. I don\u2019t have time to wait for some guy to come over and learn the song, all that crap.\u201d\n\nWorking with programming helped free Benson from his previous creative habits, opening up uncharted paths and new approaches towards making his music.\n\n\u201cI may never go back to playing the drums,\u201d Benson says. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true, but it is a lot of fun. It\u2019s a different discipline entirely. On the drum kit, you feel it out, see what feels good or whatever. But with software drums, you\u2019re constructing beats with your hands, with a mouse, and with a keyboard. It\u2019s really weird. So of course you do things that you wouldn\u2019t do on a drum kit. It\u2019s like, wow, I never would have played that beat. And then the options are limitless. Everything is right at your fingertips.\u201d\n\nUnrestrained by anything other than his own imagination, Benson drew less from genre and more from his own instincts, melding jangle and crunch, hook and riff, pomp and subtlety, into something original and his own. Sonic motivation came from a range of unexpected sources, spanning hip-hop icons like Vince Staples and Kendrick Lamar to the top 40 hits his kids played around the house.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always kind of battling cynicism,\u201d he adds, \u201cbeing a cynic about music. So listening to what my kids listen to, it helps me break down the barriers in myself. The kids put on Justin Bieber and my knee jerk reaction is to turn it off. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m forced to listen in and by God, I start liking it. I find something good in it and then that maybe pops up in my music.\u201d\n\nWith the aesthetic doors blown open, Benson saw his songs grow more complex, multi-tiered, and rhapsodic. From the future funk-fueled \u201cI Can If You Want Me To,\u201d through \u201cGood To Be Alive\u201d and the madcap \u201cFreak Out,\u201d to the elegiac finale, \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Love You,\u201d his long vaunted knack for pure pop craftsmanship is paired with a progressive, left-of-center dynamism unlike anything in his body of work.\n\nWhile tracks like \u201cDear Life\u201d and the ecstatic \u201cRichest Man Alive\u201d are undeniably animated and even joyful, Benson is quick to note that there\u2019s more going on than necessarily meets the ear. The buoyant melodies and irrepressible hooks are tinted with self-doubt and instinctive irony, their affirmative messages colored by encroaching middle age and the songwriter\u2019s own mortality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just singing about me,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50 and it\u2019s freaking me out so that\u2019s kind of coming up in the songs.\u201d\n\nAfter almost two years, DEAR LIFE was finally approaching completion. Benson signed on with new management and began talking with labels, ready at last to return to the fray. And then Jack called.\n\n\u201cMy wife was like, OK, off you go,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously, I was stoked. That band is fun. I get to be in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band, that\u2019s my dream. And I get to share it all with a bunch of guys that I love and respect.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade, The Raconteurs finally returned to action in 2019 with their critically acclaimed, chart-topping third LP, HELP US STRANGER, highlighted in part by a couple of songs Benson had been kicking around for his own LP, \u201cOnly Child\u201d and \u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying).\u201d The Raconteurs\u2019 epic 2019 world tour proved equally successful, playing to ecstatic sold-out houses from Nashville to New Zealand and all points in-between. Still buzzing with big rock energy, Benson returned home and recorded two more for DEAR LIFE: the short, sharp \u201cI\u2019m In Love\u201d and the persistent slacker anthem, \u201cI Quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Raconteurs helped me get off my ass and get back into the swing of things,\u201d Benson says. \u201cI got to exercise that muscle again. I came home really excited just to get back to my thing. Whereas before, I think I was a little overwhelmed. It\u2019s daunting to make a record and get a band together and tour an album.

The two continue to share the spotlight as the band's co-songwriters and co-lead singers. Ed has sung lead on some of the band's biggest hits, including \"One Week\", \"Pinch Me\", and \"If I Had $1,000,000\", as well as the band's most recent single, \"Easy\", off of their 8th studio record, 'Barenaked Ladies Are Me'.\n\nWhen not with Barenaked Ladies, Ed remains active in music. He has produced for the Canadian band The Waltons, as well as the solo-project of The Waltons' lead singer, Jason Plumb. Ed also co-wrote the song \"Satellite\", which appeared on Jason's record. Ed has also written songs with country singer John Berry (\"He Makes Me Want Her Again\"), Andy Kim, and the band Hanson. He has also lent his vocal skills to duets with fellow Canadian artists Holly Cole, Melanie Doane, and YAP, as well as the side-projects of fellow band members Tyler Stewart (Don't Talk Dance) and Jim Creeggan (The Brothers Creeggan). More recently, Ed also wrote and sang the \"Wiggle Song\" that can currently be heard on the international television ad campaign for Jell-O products. On rare occasions, he does solo shows himself, where he will feature some of the music he's written with artists outside of BNL, as well as some of BNL's best-known songs. However, Ed insists that, unlike his other 4 band members, he has no intention of starting a side project or solo album of his own.\n\nEd has also ventured outside of the world of music, modeling for designer Harry Rosen, and acting in two feature films, Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle and the award-winning indie film, Love, Sex, and Eating the Bones, where he had a prominent supporting role.\n\nIn the fall of 2006, Canada's Outdoor Life Network will begin showing Ed's Up, a reality show featuring Ed, a licensed pilot, flying his Cessna all over Canada, performing everyday, \"blue-collar\" jobs. The show was filmed in the summer of 2006, and while filming, Ed performed a number of small, impromptu solo concerts, including one in a small town in Newfoundland which helped raise money for some recently orphaned children, whom Ed is also helping by backing the establishment of a trust fund.\n\nEd lives in the suburbs of Toronto with his wife, 3 children, and a couple of pets.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.BNLBlog.com or http://www.BNLMusic.com\n\nFor unashamed drooling, visit http://www.dystopiary.com/ed", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wheeland Brothers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6857251.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Surfy, Beach, Surf Rock, California Country, No Shoes, California Reggae, Surf Music E Reggae., Reggae-pop, Alternative Rock, Jimmy Buffett, Surf, Pirate, Islandreggae, Sandy, Beachy, Ocean, Soft Rock, Sand, Reggae, Barefoot Country, Acoustic", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "We are the Wheeland Brothers.

Leaving the past where it belongs, accepting there\u2019s no way to know what\u2019s ahead, and challenging himself to be present in both love and life. It\u2019s heady stuff. It also rocks.\n\nWith a career full of critical acclaim and popular success, Carll could\u2019ve played it safe on this, his sixth record, but he didn\u2019t. The result is a musically ambitious and lyrically deep statement of an artist in his creative prime.\n\nHayes Carll\u2019s list of accomplishments is long. His third album, 2008\u2019s Trouble In Mind, earned him an Americana Music Association Award for Song of the Year (for \u201cShe Left Me for Jesus\u201d). The follow-up, KMAG YOYO was the most played album on the Americana Chart in 2011 and spawned covers by artists as varied as Hard Working Americans and Lee Ann Womack, whose version of \u201cChances Are\u201d garnered Carll a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers swept the Austin Music Awards, and was his fourth record in a row to reach #1 on the Americana Airplay chart. Kelly Willis and Kenny Chesney have chosen to record his songs and his television appearances include The Tonight Show, Austin City Limits, and Later w/Jools Holland. Carll is the rare artist who can rock a packed dancehall one night and hold a listening room at rapt attention the next.\n\n\u201cRepeating myself creatively would ultimately leave me empty. Covering new ground, exploring, and taking chances gives me juice and keeps me interested.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wanted to find the next level. On What It Is, he clearly has.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t necessarily easy to get there. Carll\u2019s last release, 2016\u2019s Lovers and Leavers was an artistic and commercial risk \u2014 a bold move which eschewed the tempo and humor of much of his previous work. The record revealed a more serious singer-songwriter dealing with more serious subjects \u2014 divorce, new love in the middle of life, parenting, the worth of work. What It Is finds him now on the other side, revived and happy, but resolute \u2014 no longer under the impression that any of it comes for free.\n\n\u201cI want to dig in so this life doesn\u2019t just pass me by. The more engaged I am the more meaning it all has. I want that to be reflected in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd meaning there is. Carll sings \u201cbut I try because I want to,\u201d on the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cNone\u2019Ya.\u201d He\u2019s not looking back lamenting love lost, rather, finding joy and purpose in the one he\u2019s got and hanging on to the woman who sometimes leaves him delightedly scratching his head. \u201cIf I May Be So Bold,\u201d finds him standing on similar ground \u2014 lyrically taking on the challenge of participating fully in life rather than discontentedly letting life happen.\n\nBold enough to not surrender bold enough to give a damn\n\nBold enough to keep on going or to stay right where I am\n\nThere\u2019s a whole world out there waiting full of stories to be told\n\nI\u2019ll heed the call and tell\u2019em all if I may be so bold\n\nThere\u2019s no wishy washy here and he\u2019s not on the sidelines. In fact, he\u2019s neck-deep in life. On the rambunctious, fiddle-punctuated, \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d he laments political division in America while delivering a rapid-fire plea to \u201cdo my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor, while keeping all my joie de vivre.\u201d Carll\u2019s signature cleverness and aptitude for so-personal-you-might-miss-it political commentary is as strong as ever. The stark, \u201cFragile Men,\u201d co-written with singer-songwriter Lolo, uses humor and dripping sarcasm to examine his gender\u2019s resistance to change in less than three minutes of string-laden, almost Jacques Brel invoking drama. It\u2019s new musical territory for Carll, and the result is powerful. His voice is strong and resonant on these songs, and it\u2019s thrilling to hear him use it with a new authority. He is alternately commanding and tender, yet always soulful.\n\nCarll returned to trusted producer Brad Jones (producer of 2008\u2019s Trouble in Mind and 2011\u2019s KMAG YOYO) and Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to record What It Is, and recruited singer-songwriter, author, and fiancee Allison Moorer as co-producer. The production is adventurous while keeping the focus on the singer and his songs and providing a path for him to go where he wants to go. Where that is, is forward.\n\nThat\u2019s evident in the songwriting. Carll continues to hone his singular voice, but is also a flexible co-writer. Matraca Berg, Charlie Mars, Adam Landry, and Moorer have co-writing credits here, but it was Moorer\u2019s inspiration that provided the largest impact.\n\n\u201cOn the songwriting front she\u2019s just a pro. She helps me cut through the noise and she does it with wit and style.\u201d\n\nCarll\u2019s own wit and style has never been more evident. Whether it\u2019s with the put-you-in-picture detail of, \u201cBeautiful Thing,\u201d the not quite sheepish enough, dude-esque defense of dishonesty in, \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d or the strong as a tree trunk declaration of love on, \u201cI Will Stay,\u201d he displays an increasing command of his poetic lexicon.\n\nWriters most often wrestle with experience and expectations, either romanticizing the past or telling us how good it\u2019s going to be when they get where they\u2019re going. What It Is is a record that is rooted solidly in the present, revealing an artist in the emotional and intellectual here and now.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Champagne Drip ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8996159.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Champagne Drip, the newest musical incarnation of Los Angeles-based producer Sam Pool, was born out of a philosophy that innovation springs from inspiration. Pool had carved out a unique place for himself in the bass music community; performing under the moniker of SPL for over 10 years and releasing drum & bass, dubstep, and trap-oriented music on respected labels such as Barcode, Tech Itch, Evol Intent, Sub Human, Rottunn, and SMOG Recordings. SPL\u2019s music was fully immersed in sound design, a musical landscape comprised of melodic, dark, and refined touches. By the Summer of 2014, Pool came to the realization that he had pushed the SPL project to its sonic boundaries and in order to evolve musically, he would need a new project to explore lighter textures and richer melodies. Rooted in jungle and bass music and built around elements of blippy 8-bit sounds, arpeggios, and lush 80s synths, Champagne Drip launched as a decidedly tropical and uplifting sounding project. Operating at first in anonymity, Champagne Drip made a big splash thru the release of official remixes of Bassnectar (Amorphous Music) and Elliphant (Mad Decent). Shortly thereafter, he released his debut EP \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d on Mad Decent in September of 2014. Over the first year of the project\u2019s history, press outlets were fascinated with the unique sound, but also with uncovering the identity of the secretive producer behind the music. \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d was subsequently remixed by electronic upstarts Big Wild, Lazerdisk, Mayhem, and Son of Kick and released in the Spring of 2015 as \u201cRemix Bikini\u201d. In the Fall of 2015, Champagne Drip released his 2nd EP for Mad Decent, \u201cJourney Into The Champagne Sea\u201d. Whereas his first EP explored more overtly tropical overtones, \u201cJourney\u201d went into deeper and darker musical territory. After spending one full year refining his sound in the studio, he finally revealed himself as the former SPL in 2016; performing across the US at such festivals as Mysteryland, WTFest?, Imagine, Enchanted Forest, and Lights All Night. Building up anticipation for his next original recordings, Champagne Drip released the stand alone single \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d, which was featured on the official Bernie Sanders Presidential campaign fundraising compilation \u201cRave4Bernie\u201d. Official remixes for Grandtheft (Mad Decent), Cardinox (Warner Brothers), and Dillon Francis & NGHTMRE (Mad Decent) followed. Champagne Drip capped off an already busy 2016 with the release of two new EPs; \u201cPoseidon\u201d via Quality Goods Records and \u201cOf Course I Still Love You\u201d via Saturate Records. Official remixes for Zeds Dead & Diplo, UZ, and DAWN all saw early 2017 releases. Champagne Drip is set to have his biggest year yet in 2017, with multiple EPs scheduled for release on Deadbeats Records as well as forthcoming remixes for 12th Planet and Mayhem, which are due for Summer releases. https://twitter.com/champagnedrip https://soundcloud.com/champagnedrip https://www.instagram.com/champagnedrip Bookings: champagnedripbookings@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.twitch.tv/cardinalnow"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Earth, Wind ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Fire ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7761839.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Rock, Psychedelic Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "FIRE: A live Fire CD is now available for pre-release order!\n\n\"THE MAGIC SHOEMAKER LIVE!\", which includes blistering versions of \"FATHER'S NAME IS DAD\" and \"TREACLE TOFFEE WORLD\", will be released on 6th October, 2008 on Angel Air Records.

His band in high school, M!ND fURY, wrote and recorded 100 songs, all of them good (lol). Out of high school he formed the band Digma while he also DJd raves around the Midwest. Digma tracked their ep at Smart Studios in Madison, WI. The famed studio Nirvana rehearsed what would become Nevermind, and The Smashing Pumpkins tracked their debut album.\n\n\n\nIn 2002 Voidova moved north to Minneapolis and formed Xerus. Over the next 6 years Xerus would tour the nation, have songs on college radio coast to coast, play SXSW and release two e.p.'s on their label, SkinCell Record Group.\n\n\n\nWith Xerus taking a break 2008, Voidova set his sights on a city where music business is actually a thing that is happening. In 2009 he moved to Los Angeles and joined an arena rock band called Machine Empire. Taking on the roll of only singing for the first time, Voidova made his mark on the soon to be extinct Sunset Strip Metal scene. Machine Empire's fan base began to grow, and a documentary film was being shot of the band, to be shopped to major networks. Alas, the band imploded and the footage never saw the light of day, except for one trailer. Opening for LA Guns at the now closed Knitting Factory was one of many highlights of the early days of Machine Empire.\n\n\nOver the next few years, Voidova bounced from project to project. Wrapped up in work, life, and love, putting together another band wasn't a priority. Now living in Santa Monica with his beautiful lady, he settled in and began writing what would become his next incarnation, Salt Altar. \"each/other\" was released on Bandcamp in 2014. A music video for his take on Madonna's \"Open Your Heart,\" from the viewpoint of a male stalker was released to promote the album.\n\n\nIn 2015 Voidova moved to San Francisco for work. He wrote and recorded what would become the Park Regent e.p. After having friends listen to it, the urge to release it and get it out to the masses struck. He moved back to Santa Monica, and through a friend he found HRDRV, the indie label he is now signed to. The rest is history being written right now. New Voidova music is in the works.

After a live audition, she was selected for the 2010 Artist Roster at the world renowned Strathmore Music Hall and invited to play the mansion in 2012. Flo was the only DC based musician selected to play Merriweather Post Pavilion as part of the Virgin Mobile Free Fest's Busking Brigade, where she joined an impressive bill: Weezer, Blink 182, the Bravery, and Franz Ferdinand.

In '87 Jask began djing at the age of 13. Influences consisted of soul, jazz, funk, r&b, hip hop, rock, new wave, disco, early electro & freestyle. A year later he would soon discover and quickly embrace a passion for the music that was coming out of Chicago & New York, known as the underground house sound. Jask was one of the major players to introduce the acid jazz sound to Tampa & most of central Florida in the early 90's. He held Tampa's longest running eclectic loungin' night called, \"Martini Jazz\". It took place every Thursday night at a club called the Castle which ran from '94 to '96. The \"Martini Jazz\" night brought some notoriety to Jask, which eventually led him to assist in the promotions of \"Groove Collective's (NYC) first ever performance in the Tampa area. In December of 1995, Jask started Tampa's first weekly soulful underground house night called, \"Jacks House\". During its successful over a decade ongoing run, Jask has played alongside various talented djs such as: Mark Farina, Dj Disciple, Benji Candelario, Marques Wyatt, Doug Smith, Brian Tappert , Miguel Migs, King Britt, Tedd Patterson, Tommy Musto, Kaskade, Pete Moss, David Harness, Rasoul, Julius Papp, Matthias Heibronn, Jay-J, Little Louie Vega, Frankie Feliciano, Karizma, Mark Grant, Johnny Fiasco, Diz, Collete, Heather, Tortured Soul, Cevin Fisher, Harry Choo Choo Romero, Cajmere, Lisa Shaw, JJK and many other luminaries in the dance music industry...As of Today, Jask still holds down Jack's House(Tuesdays) and a new night called, \"Paradise\" which has become the new Underground house night in the Tampa area and features guest djs from all around the globe. On the production and remix side of the musical pendulum, Jask has appeared on such notable labels as: Vega, King Street/NiteGrooves, I!Records, Swanky, Metaphor, K2/Vinylicious, Step Ahead, Erotic City, DeepTouch, Harlequin, SoulGroove, Soulfuric Deep, Soulfuric, Soufuric Trax, Catch 22, Deeplay, Solu, Om, Vino, Defected, Undo, Large Music, Salted, Sole Channel, Ultra, Rhythm & Culture, Transport & NeoDisco. His most successful project to date is his release on Soulfuric Deep called Jask featuring Jocie \"Beautiful\" it was released at the end of 2001. This was Jask's first original vocal track in which he wrote everything from the music to the lyrics with haunting lush deep vocals from his friend Jocie. It is a special release in which Jask has dedicated it to his late mother who passed away July 31, 2001. Due to the successful Jacks house night in Tampa and his music productions, Jask has had the luxury of performing/djing across the United States and beyond. Such destinations include, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Denver, St. Louis, Atlantic City, Miami, Ft.

Three years ago, the Chicago-based trio parted ways with their indie rock roots to record their own take on the hip hop classic \u201cSummertime.\u201d With a smooth bed of 808s and hand claps, the song made the rounds on lists of must-download summer songs and landed the band on Comedy Central\u2019s Tosh.0. But the American reception to the song paled in comparison to an unlikely spot on the map: Lithuania. While the band continued to wage the American DIY-band battle for attention at small club shows around the US, the situation was much different in the former member of the USSR. The band had become a household name, and the song\u2019s accompanying video had racked up more than one million views. \u201cWe started to get all these messages from fans in Eastern Europe about how much they loved the song,\u201d lead singer David McMillin says. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t think that we were catching on somewhere halfway around the world.\u201d Fast forward to 2015, and there was a big reason to start to believe their own hype: the US Embassy in Lithuania offered to bring Fort Frances to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, to headline one of the city\u2019s biggest summer festivals, Loftas Fest. The lineup included Mercury Prize-winning Young Fathers and XL/Terrible Records rapper Le1f. \u201cHere we are, this unknown band with our name alongside some of these huge artists from around the world,\u201d bassist Jeff Piper says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even believe we were going until we were on the plane.\u201d When the band touched down, they stepped into a scene reminiscent of Rodriguez discovering his fans in \u201cSearching for Sugar Man.\u201d The band\u2019s name was plastered on billboards and street signs. They appeared on \u201cGood Morning, Lithuania.\u201d They headlined the sold-out opening night of the festival. It was clear the band had found a second home. \u201cOur week in Lithuania was one of the most rewarding times of my life,\u201d McMillin says. \u201cYou start playing music in a garage without a clue of where it can take you. I never would have expected the road could lead us to a stage in the former Eastern Bloc.\u201d That same road brought them back home to put the finishing touches on a new full-length album with Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter, Lake Street Dive) in a studio tucked away in the woods of Parsonsfield, Maine with a refreshed outlook on creative exploration. The New England retreat gave the band an opportunity to cross into unfamiliar sonic territory. \u201cThere are moments on this record I never would have imagined we would have been able to make a few years ago,\u201d drummer Aaron Kiser says. The crunchy guitar-monies layered behind the falsetto phrasing of \u201cTake the Wheel\u201d, the marimba-sub synth combo of \u201cEverything is Starting to Make Sense\u201d, the frantic pacing of \u201cThe Light Years\u201d \u2014 this cast of songs puts the spotlight on a band that is growing increasingly comfortable with loosening its roots in the past. \u201cMemories are not meant to be kept inside a frame, so before we drive out to the coast tonight, I will drive myself insane,\u201d McMillin sings on lead single \u201cBuilding A Wall.\u201d \u201cOver the past year, I feel like we\u2019ve taken some big steps for the band,\u201d McMillin says. \u201cThe time overseas helped us open the door to welcome a world of new possibilities.\u201d When it came time to choose a title the album, the choice was clear. \u201cAlio\u201d is Lithuanian for hello. www.fortfrancesmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nicole Atkins ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10100354.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Rock N Roll Epic", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "In each song she creates, Nicole Atkins reveals her incredible power to transport listeners to a much more charmed time and space. On Italian Ice, the New Jersey-bred singer/songwriter conjures the romance and danger and wild magic of a place especially close to her heart: the Jersey Shore in all its scrappy beauty. Inspired by the boardwalk\u2019s many curiosities\u2014the crumbling Victorian mansions, the legendary funhouse, the Asbury Park rock-and-roll scene she played a key part in reviving\u2014Atkins transforms her neverending fascination into a wonderland of her own making.\n\nFor help in capturing the shore\u2019s kinetic spirit, Atkins assembled a studio band whose lineup feels almost mythical. Recorded at the iconic Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama, Italian Ice finds the Nashville-based artist joined by Spooner Oldham and David Hood (both members of The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, who played on classic records from the likes of Aretha Franklin and Etta James), Binky Griptite of The Dap Kings, Jim Sclavunos and Dave Sherman of The Bad Seeds, and drummer McKenzie Smith (St. Vincent, Midlake). With special guests including Spoon frontman Britt Daniel, Seth Avett of The Avett Brothers, Erin Rae, and John Paul White, the album is a testament to Atkins\u2019s uncommon talent for uniting musicians of radically different sensibilities. As Atkins explains, the abundance of collaborations on Italian Ice partly stems from a freak accident in which she stumbled into a sinkhole in a Knoxville parking lot\u2014an incident that left her with a profound longing to fill her life with the people and experiences that bring her the most joy.\n\nCo-produced by Atkins and Ben Tanner of Alabama Shakes, Italian Ice makes brilliant use of its A-list personnel, unfolding in a kaleidoscopic sound that Atkins likens to \u201can acid trip through my record collection.\u201d At turns as opulent as symphonic pop and gritty as garage punk, the album wanders into shades of psych-rock and honky-tonk and girl-group melodrama, endlessly spotlighting the tightly honed musicianship and unbridled originality at heart of Atkins\u2019s artistry.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hayley Sabella ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8464730.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 9 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-09", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hayley Sabella hails mostly from the New England coast. Inspired by the dramatic landscape and vast seasonal changes that range as much in temperature as they do in color, she reaches for the earth itself in its various forms to give her a sense of belonging. As the daughter of musicians and missionaries, this brought her to experience pivotal years of her childhood in Central America. Naturally, music became a tool through which she could make sense of the world and put down roots, despite a lingering feeling of displacement.\nAs evidenced in her songs, there is a lustrous display of tension and relief; a relationship between vulnerability and strength, death and rebirth, pain and love. Existing in performance as much as in song, this ongoing conflict allows audiences to gain a glimpse of Sabella\u2019s true persona; she may break your heart, but shortly thereafter will invite you in for a cup of tea, enjoyed most with whiskey.\nAfter experimenting with fresh palets and uncharted terrain, Sabella has established a sound she\u2019s been ever yearning for with Forgive the Birds, the second full-length studio album, to be released this April. Forgive the Birds is both earthbound and ethereal, revealing gripping melodies and intimate lyrics with an unabashedly earnest delivery. Her voice, described as \u201choneyed, but with a mild rasp\u201d by Redline Roots, dances over a finger-picked 1965 hollow-body Gibson; a signature sound of the record and a staple in performance, they make for a pair that seems to know one another, trusted companions both in writing and in travel.\nWorking with Daniel Radin of The Novel Ideas to produce Forgive the Birds, and enlisting the engineering talents of Harris Paseltiner, of Boston-based band Darlingside, this is, without a doubt, a homegrown record.

She is also the founder of SBS Records.\n\nMalone was born and raised in Atlanta, GA by a musician mom with whom she toured in the summers. She grew up listening to her mother and grandmother sing in the church choir every Sunday when they werent on the road. She dropped out of high school at 16 to begin work on her rock and roll degree. After a few brushes with the law and some unsavory characters, Michelle decided to go back to high school and became the valedictorian for a small class. She attended Agnes Scott College with dreams of becoming a doctor, but was offered a record deal with Clive Davis at Arista Records, which looked alot more interesting to her than more school.\n\nWhen it came time to craft her own sound, she took those religious and secular roots, blended in enough folk, blues and rock to satisfy, and came up with a rootsy high-spirited sound that brings acoustic and electric slide and passionate vocals together harkening back to the lost recordings of Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, and Lucinda Williams.\n\nAfter several major label releases, Malone is now an independent artist with 15 studio records to date and an impressive resume which includes hi profile performances with everyone from Gregg Allman to John Mayer, the Atlanta Symphony to Ellen Degeneres, various awards including best albums, 4x best singer, 3x best acoustic guitarist, and 2 Grammy ballot nominations. Her songs have appeared in such films as Bam Bam and Celeste, All Over Me, Shotgun Jesus and television programs True Blood, Dawson's Creek, Felicity, Brooklyn South. They have been recorded by Indigo Girls (for which she received both gold and platinum records), Antigone Rising, and Vistoso Bosses.\n\nMalone has always made time for philanthropic endeavors such as running the Paris marathon for Team In Training/The Leukemia Society, and cycling with Team Earth Challenge from Atlanta to Yucca Mountain, NV in protest of the nuclear waste dumping. In 2012 she started a college scholarship fund for girls in need. She currently contributes to various women's and children's non-profit organizations, and donates time to local Georgia music organizations and schools.\n\nMalone has performed for TedX Peachtree, sang the National Anthem for The Atlanta Braves and The Houston Comets, been honored with a Signature guitar slide modeled and named after her by Rocky Mountain Slides, was the keynote speaker at a SoCal high school graduation, has been the rhythm guitarist and mandolin player for Kristian Bush (Sugarland), a satellite member of the Indigo Girls, is endorsed by Supro USA Guitars and amps Reunion Blues, and Breedlove guitars and mandolins. Michelle's latest recording, Slings and Arrows, was released March 2018 and debuted at #8 on the Billboard Blues charts.\n\nFor tour dates, info and booking or, please visit www.michellemalone.com/contact", "otherInfo": "Michelle Malone\u2019s Friends and Family Birthday show!
