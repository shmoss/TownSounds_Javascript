Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Walker County ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10398628.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ryan Griffin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10398621.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "From working on the farm as a child, to co-writing Kelsea Ballerini's hit \"Dibs\" to honing his own music, Ryan Griffin has always been about blending pure talent with good old hard work and tireless dedication. And, since arriving in Nashville from Florida at seventeen, he's also always been about guiding his career equally from the gut and the heart. Since his top-streaming song \"Woulda Left Me Too\" introduced him as a singer with an unusually empathetic hand (and garnered millions of plays on Spotify), Griffin has been working to release music that finds his unique niche between R&B and country, and between fun and true vulnerability. And now, with three new busbee-produced tracks and more on the horizon, Griffin has never been more ready for this moment.\n\n\"I've never felt more true to myself than I have with this music,\" says Griffin. \"These songs have never felt so right.\" Indeed, \"Best Cold Beer,\" \"Good Company\" and \"Play It By Heart\" are pure Griffin: they're fun, as soulful and groovy as they are twangy, and uniquely perceptive, packed with razor-sharp insights about living and loving.\nThe child of hardworking parents who always instilled a deep work ethic in their son, Griffin spend his youth out in the sod fields and, in his down time, wrestling for any say in the car radio stations with his two brothers and his mom \u2013 to little success. But in hindsight, it was for the best: he ended up listening to everything from Vince Gill and George Strait to modern pop and R&B once he hit high school, and it shaped him in ways he didn't even realize at the time.\n\nOne evening his father \u2013 who also loved Jimmy Buffett \u2013 took him to a local country festival, and Griffin's future suddenly became clear: \"I got to see Kenny Chesney and Alan Jackson and all of these dudes,\" Griffin remembers. \"That's when I realized this is what I want to do.\"\n\nA little boy who would hum melodies almost before he could talk, Griffin was always a musical kid, but his father, who raised two more sports-focused sons before him, didn't know quite what to do with him. So, one day, he pulled out the phone book.\n\n\"He said 'I'm going to call everyone who has something to do with music and find out what to do with this kid',\" Griffin remembers. \"He sat there for hours and there was finally this dude who answered the phone, and he had a studio in his garage which was kind of unheard of. My pops said, 'alright we'll be there this week.'\"\n\nGriffin went in and recorded a little demo, and that was it. He spent the rest of his teenage years opening for the likes of Neil McCoy and Highway 101, and playing any\nstage he could. Then, at seventeen, he finally followed his dreams to Nashville, enrolling at Belmont University, first in the voice program and then, afraid all the training would massage the character form his sound, in the Music Business program. And, like most promising graduates, he hit all the milestones: he won the country music showcase, played the Best of the Best, and scored an internship at Broken Bow that saw him hitting the road to help tour manage Jason Aldean.\n\nBut it still didn't all come easy after that: bouncing through a label and a publishing deal, Griffin sometimes wondered if this creative life was becoming too much of a hardship for his young family \u2013 but it was his wife who told him to stay the path and keep pursuing his dreams. So in 2017, he released his EP, Sake of the Summer, with \"Woulda Left Me Too\" now topping five million streams \u2013 and \"Dibs\" going to number one.\n\nFor this next sampling of songs (\"Best Cold Beer,\" \"Good Company\" and \"Play It By Heart\") Griffin just wanted to focus on making it relatable. \"I wanted to write songs that people could really latch on to,\" he says. \"To meet people where they are and provide an escape, while being truly authentic to me.\"\n\nAnd for Griffin, that means providing both plaintive moments and pure fun. Produced by busbee, these three songs are indeed both: a little bit Keith Urban and a little bit Brian McKnight, \"'Good Company' is a departure and it's an escape,\" says Griffin. \"You can't not dance and forget about all the B.S. But I'm not afraid of a vulnerable song that cuts to the heart, and 'Play It By Heart' is about how I live my life and how my wife and I walk through our marriage.\" And \"Best Cold Beer\" is a surprising lyrical twist about the lure of romance \u2013 and a good turn on the dance floor.\n\nHaving already opened for the likes of Ballerini, Lady Antebellum and Old Dominion, Griffin will take these songs on the road this summer at select festival dates while he hones his record. One of Rolling Stone\u2019s 10 New Country Artists You Need to Know he's also been highlighted on 2018 Ones to Watch lists by AOL, AXS, Country Fancast, NY Country Swag, PopDust and Thought Catalog \u2013 and all as a result of keeping his eye on his ultimate goal, no matter the circumstances.\n\n\"I always knew in my heart if I kept fighting, if I kept pushing and kept grinding,\" he says, \"I'd get there. This is my calling.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anthony DeVito ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10265031.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Comedy, One Man Show, Standup Comedy, Stand Up Comedy, Stand Up, Sketch Comedy, Improvisation", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Anthony DeVito is a NYC based comedian who recently made his network television debut on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

The young Dallas native began to see a lifetime of hard work pay off in spades in 2015, as he signed with Sunfire Entertainment, released a critically acclaimed debut album, cracked the top 25 on the Texas Music Chart, and shared bills with Hayes Carll, Randy Rogers, Turnpike Troubadours, Green River Ordinance, and more. \"This is all I wanted to do since I was 14,\" he reflects, \"and now I'm doing it.\"\n\nWith so much momentum on his side, it's no surprise that Cartwright titled his new release 'Don't Fade.' It's a note-to-self that he more than lives up to on the EP, bringing together the heartfelt vulnerability of Ryan Adams and the arena-ready anthems of Eric Church into an infectious, genre-blurring masterpiece. The tracks showcase Cartwright's considerable growth, both as a writer and performer, while honing in on the sharp lyrics and soulful delivery that earned his self-titled debut widespread praise in Texas and beyond. The Dallas Observer called that record \"one of the very best of 2015,\" while the Fort Worth Star Telegram raved that \"there\u2019s an ease and a polish\u2026belying Cartwright\u2019s relative youth,\" and Red Dirt Nation said that it \"stirs what makes us all feel young and poignantly reminds us how fragile we all are when it comes to love, heartbreak and home.\" For Cartwright, though, it was only just the prelude.\n\n\"You never know what you don't know,\" he reflects from his newly adopted hometown of Nashville. \"I'm very proud of that first record and some of those songs have done very well for me, but with a whole additional year-and-a-half of hard touring and writing under my belt when we recorded 'Don't Fade,' I felt like I had a much better idea of how I wanted to sound and who I was as an artist.\"\n\nCartwright grew up in a conservative Texas home where his exposure to modern music was limited primarily to the 'Forrest Gump' soundtrack and Steven Curtis Chapman records. For his twelfth birthday, his parents gave him an acoustic guitar, and suddenly the entire world opened up. He discovered singer-songwriters and alt-country troubadours, contemporaries like Pete Yorn and classic artists like John Prine. It led him to begin penning his own songs, and by the time he hit high school, he was playing regularly in bars and churches. A summer program at NYU exposed Cartwright to the world outside of Dallas and inspired him to head even further from home to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\nCartwright worked his way through school with odd jobs in the music industry and wedding band gigs, and while they paid the bills, they left him unsatisfied and more convinced than ever that he needed to take the leap with his own music. He moved back to Texas and recorded an EP, 'Bull Run,' that earned him top honors in the B.W. Stevenson Songwriting Competition. A performance with John Fullbright led Cartwright to Oklahoma, where he collaborated with producer Wes Sharon on the self-titled debut that would break him onto the Texas radio charts.\n\nThroughout it all, Cartwright was a hustler to his core, playing 100+ shows per year without an agent or a manager, working harder than he ever had before in his life but moving closer towards his goals every day. The quality of the music and the exhilarating live performances were turning heads throughout the south, and that's when Cartwright caught the ear of fellow Texas songwriter Rob Baird, who offered to produce 'Don't Fade' with Brian Douglas Phillips at Phillips\u2019 Austin-based Rattle Trap Studio.\n\n\"We spent three or four days in total at Rob's house before we went into the studio because I had between 30-50 songs that I had written,\" remembers Cartwright. \"Rob and I went through each of them and pared the list down to figure out what made for a cohesive collection and what kind of sound we wanted to go after.\"\n\nThe sound that they ultimately landed on is instantly appealing, a warm, radio-friendly blend that calls to mind everything from Will Hoge to The Old 97's. Earworm opener \"Never Coming Back\" is an ideal showcase for Cartwright's gifts, with his silky-smooth vocals riding a laid-back drum groove punctuated by dynamic electric guitar riffs and classic rock organ swells.\n\n\"That was one of the first co-writes I ever did in Nashville,\" says Cartwright. \"I wrote it with Ty Graham, who had actually been my next door neighbor at Berklee during my freshman year. We always used to talk about girls and relationships in college, and when we sat down to write this song, the story was something we'd both experienced in our personal lives, so it came together really naturally.\"\n\nCartwright takes a darker turn on \"Busted,\" a driving, gritty tune inspired by the breakdown of a truck in the west Texas heat that mirrored the breakdown of his own crumbling relationship, while \"Nobody But You\" channels the pain of staying behind while a loved one leaves, and the sweetly emotional \"Don't Fade\" battles the inevitable passage of time. One of the most special moments for Cartwright, though, comes at the end of the EP, as the stripped-down acoustic meditation of \"Arkansas\" drifts off into an ethereal soundscape like the last rays of light at sunset.\n\n\"That ending was a very specific idea that came to me on a camping trip with my roommate,\" remembers Cartwright. \"We were spending the days and nights out in the middle of nowhere just listening to the crickets chirp and trying to figure out life, and I wanted to recreate that feeling.\"\n\nThe ability to capture such intimate, meaningful moments is the magic of Cartwright's songwriting. These are tunes about coming and going, uncertainty and change, finding yourself and what you're willing to sacrifice for your dreams. There are no dramatic revelations here, just the steadily deepening understanding of self that comes with maturing. Cartwright renders the sound of growing up beautifully and in vivid detail, capturing the anxiety and the ecstasy in all its messy, human glory. For a kid who grew up worshipping songwriters, to craft such exceptional music is to truly live the dream, and with another full length album on the way, it's safe to say Troy Cartwright's years are going to just keep getting bigger and bigger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Breakfast ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8833164.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Progressive, Rock, Progressive Rock, Jam, Jazz, Funk, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The band was formed in East Haven, Connecticut in 1998, during which time all the original members met: guitarist Tim Palmieri, bassist Ron Spears, drummer Adrian Tramontano and keyboardist Jordan Giangreco.

It is a reference to Pink Floyd's song \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\" from their album Atom Heart Mother. Besides playing cover songs by classic rockers such as The Doors and Floyd, they released a self-titled DIY studio album in 1999. The band's popularity began to rise after four songs from this album were featured on the MTV series Undressed.\n\nThe band won their first Jammy for being \"New Groove of the Year\" in 2004. Around the same time, the band decided to change their name due to misnomers of the seriousness of the band leading to the loss of booking for shows and festivals. Spears defended the choice, though, saying that \"the Music is what is important, not the name.\" While supporting their 2005 release, Real Radio, the band performed a national tour, at times backing up popular bands such as The Wailers, moe., North Mississippi Allstars, and Gomez. In early July of 2006, Giangreco left and the band continued on as a trio.\n\nThe band is also known for a high level of musicianship. In the current incarnation, instrument swapping between members is not uncommon. Guitar virtuoso Tim Palmieri also plays keyboards, drums and bass.

Not just because she was only one of about seven Black kids in her junior high school, but because of the compelling power of her shockingly big voice, which stopped people in their tracks from early on. Danielia\u2019s natural gift--raw, searing vocal chops combined with a deep, buttery tone--draws from the two different rich traditions that she absorbed early in her youth. On the one hand, she couldn\u2019t get enough of what her friends and neighbors were listening to: AC/DC, Zeppelin, the Stones. On the other, she was her mother\u2019s girl: daughter of a jazz singer and member of the church gospel choir, grooving to Mavis Staples, Etta James, Billie and Ella.\n\nThe happy collision of these two traditions is her new album, Rare Child, produced by Brad Jones (Jill Sobule, Over the Rhine) and co-produced by Joe Blaney (Shawn Colvin, Soul Asylum) and Danielia herself. On Rare Child, the sheer joy and pain she evokes in her songs instantly draw the listener in. She pulls, stretches and grips her lyrics with a strength that is startling considering this lovely young woman\u2019s seemingly happy-go-lucky demeanor and petite frame. Appearances aside, like male counterparts Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone or crossover icon Tina Turner, Danielia not only has embraced the notion of Black Rock--she has redefined it.\n\nVery early on, music played a major role in Danielia\u2019s life. It became not only the focus of what would become her career, but also, her saving grace and her best friend. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have music saving me every day, I wouldn\u2019t have a place to put a lot of emotions that I have that could potentially be destructive,\u201d says Danielia. \u201cIt\u2019s how I survive.\u201d Citing her mother, Danielia speaks lovingly about musical influences that aren\u2019t quite from the playbook of most Rock performers. \u201cI loved Phyllis Hyman\u2019s ..Somewhere In My Lifetime,\u2019\u201d she says, \u201cand Chaka Khan. But not just the popular stuff. It was her version of ..I Loves You, Porgy\u2019 from Gershwin\u2019s Porgy and Bess. My mom also listened to things like Bonnie Raitt and Loggins & Messina. But for me, it was listening to Donny Hathaway and Stevie Wonder\u2019s album Songs In The Key of Life: it was about that tone that I thought was the best. And Nancy Wilson singing ..Guess Who I Saw Today\u2019\u2019; the first time I heard that I was like, ..I don\u2019t even like that genre\u2019 but I couldn\u2019t get over the delivery. There was so much emotion. I like artists that were living and feeling whatever it was they were singing about.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, more than any other important influence was Danielia\u2019s fascination with musical movies of the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s. \u201cI had a thing for Bing Crosby,\u201d she bashfully admits. \u201cI was an old soul. What entertained me didn\u2019t entertain most kids. But we had a deep life. So anything that would take me out of that life was important. Anything that was singing and had a story to it I liked.\u201d A very young Danielia would stand up on a wood crate in her backyard, grab a stick, and sing Donna Summer\u2019s ..Last Dance\u2019 to the trees and a few semi-curious deer, When she realized she could really belt it out, she decided she might make singing her career. Soon, 12 year-old Danielia joined her mom and aunts in a gospel group called Brookes Ensemble Plus, where she learned harmony. Around that time, Danielia received her first guitar. While her mother couldn\u2019t afford to pay for lessons, she gave Danielia a ..How To\u2019 book that the young writer devoured, locking herself in her room until she came out a comfortable player and had penned her first song.\n\nDanielia\u2019s home life wasn\u2019t always easy. Danielia never met her father, a native of Puerto Rico. Moving around a lot and experiencing the hardships of racism, Danielia had to grow up fast. And although Danielia came from very humble beginnings, the one thing the family was not lacking was love and determination to succeed. Raising four kids on her own without a college degree, Danielia\u2019s mother nevertheless became the head of accounting for Houghton-Mifflin Publishing and was determined to make sure her children had the best education possible. To that end, books were in no short supply at home (spoils of the trade), and the children learned to read at an early age, while calculators were treated as toys. Following her mother\u2019s example, Danielia strove to make the most of her opportunities, and in her junior year of high school, she gained entry to the Mercer County School of Performing Arts. Danielia excelled and graduated at the top of her class, going on to obtain a full scholarship to the esteemed Bennington College in Vermont, from which she graduated with a degree in Theater Arts.\nBennington was a major turning point for Danielia. There, she studied with the great avant garde jazz trumpeter Bill Dixon. Noted for his vocalic playing style, Dixon, who founded the Black Music division at Bennington, gave Danielia the guidance she needed to refine her distinctive power as a singer. By her junior and senior year, she was studying tutorials. \u201cHe trained my ear. I\u2019d go to his class every day, and he\u2019d hit a note on his trumpet and ask me to match it. I thought it was the most God-awful thing. But I realize today that my pitch is the way it is because of this training. He taught me basic music theory, keyboard harmony and what music reading and writing was. During my senior year, he sent me to study singing with the classical department so I could learn breath, which is where I found my power. He would die to know I was singing rock \u2018n roll now instead of jazz, but he changed my whole perception of how you sing a song.\u201d\n\nUsing classic songs like Eden Ahbez\u2019s \u201cNature Boy\u201d and reading the lyrics as a soliloquy, Danielia learned that \u201cin any good song, there\u2019s a story; it\u2019s a moment. And it\u2019s the same when you get onstage with those same set of words and discover how you can convey that story to an audience. It helped me realize why I loved singing. It was about the story, the tone\u2014it wasn\u2019t about all the ..tricks.\u2019 It was about singing the line straight. That took more skill.\u201d She credits Dixon with teaching her how to \u201csing ..ugly\u2019.\u201d She explains, \u201cYou have to be able to sing the wrong notes if you ever want to sing beautifully. You have to be able to be ..ugly\u2019 sometimes. That\u2019s where you find your true beauty.\u201d\n\nQuietly writing her own songs under wraps while she studied, she performed several original compositions at a recital after she spent her final year at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. Drawing raves for her performance as well as her songs, she had learned well by then that her lyrics had to be pulled from her own life experiences in order to be authentic and received in such a positive light. \u201cI have to write from what I know about. It\u2019s like in acting. I can\u2019t play a character who\u2019s 70 at the age of 30. I don\u2019t know what 70 is. I could go to my grandmother and ask her and she might say, ..It\u2019s a loss of faith, it\u2019s tired\u2019 or whatever, but I don\u2019t know this because I haven\u2019t been there. I could only play a role and be true to something I felt. Because then it\u2019s true.\u201d\nAs a performer, Danielia is glad she grew up pre-American Idol. \u201cMost kids today, if you ask why they want to perform, they\u2019ll say they ..want to be a star\u2019 or ..be in the music business.\u2019 I liked music not because I saw it as a way to get out of the life I lived and have more than what I had, which wasn\u2019t that much. I did it because it was fun; it was like a drug. I\u2019ve always felt a little selfish when people say, ..I do it for the people.\u2019 I do it because it does something for me.\u201d\n\nRadio stations across the country appreciated Danielia\u2019s unique rock talent. After Danielia released her first studio album, 2005\u2019s Small White Town (Hipshake Records), WXPN/Philadelphia and home of the nationally syndicated World Caf\u00e9 named her \u201cArtist To Watch\u201d in 2005, slotted the album\u2019s soulful single, \u201cIt\u2019s Only Life\u201d into heavy rotation, and featured her on their HDNetwork broadcast of \u201cOn Stage at World Caf\u00e9 Live\u201d. WXRT in Chicago featured Danielia on New Year\u2019s Eve, where she brought down the house in a live performance broadcast by ABC.\n\nExtensive national touring followed. Danielia traveled the breadth of the country, opening for some of the greatest acts in music, from Blues legends Buddy Guy and Etta James to Pop Rock giant Bon Jovi, to the Southern Rock royalty of Gregg Allman, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Little Feat. Crossing boundaries was no problem for the versatile Danielia, who has wowed alternative rock audiences of the Flaming Lips, Staind and Collective Soul, among many others.\n\nDanielia\u2019s unique talent drew rave reviews, with notices on her \u201craw intensity\u201d (Essence magazine), her \u201csoulful voice and searing telecaster\u201d (Time Out NY) and for possessing \u201cthe sort of voice for which the phrase ..force of nature\u2019 was coined\u201d (Austin American-Statesman). Relix magazine named Danielia one of the \u201c5 Artists You Should Know\u201d in 2007 and New York\u2019s Amsterdam News proclaimed Danielia \u201ca powerful musician that cannot be ignored.\u201d\n\nThose high accolades often come from those who\u2019ve been blown away by Danielia\u2019s live act. Audiences that experience Danielia and her band live are hit hard with the sheer emotionalism of her songs, and Danielia\u2019s performance style is all about revisiting the feelings that brought those songs into being in the first place. \u201cI give you everything. I\u2019m going back, and these stories are obviously from my life. I\u2019ve picked moments that I can safely go back to time and time again without getting to a place where I can\u2019t collect myself. But, in my songs, I\u2019ll go to places that are still an issue for me. Like in the song ..Rare Child,\u2019 I say, ..On the day I was born/I hope my daddy cried.\u2019 Because I\u2019m still dealing with those issues. So you have to be careful. There\u2019s a responsibility to your audience too, because some of your fans will go there with you. And they don\u2019t know how to pull back either; they\u2019re riding on what you\u2019ve given them. You\u2019re handing them a drug too.\u201d Going back to the idea of music as an emotional release, for the artist and the audience in equal measure, Danielia not only accepts the responsibility, but rather, she is flattered and thrilled by it and sees it as an opportunity. \u201cWhen you hear some of the stories that people tell you and how the songs have helped them through tough times, that\u2019s as good as somebody telling you your album went platinum,\u201d Danielia says. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be about, and then you think, ..This might not be why I wrote this song, but this is what this person got out of it,\u2019 and I\u2019m glad.\u201d\n\nA stiff self-critic, Danielia admits to pre-show and pre-recording bouts of nervousness. \u201cEric Clapton always says, ..If I\u2019m not nervous, I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.\u2019 But then that\u2019s where you get all that energy and you end up giving it back to the audience. And it means just as much to me in the studio when I record. At no time do I take it lightly. I want it to come out well. So it\u2019s harder than live, but I like to record with the band in the studio and I can pull from that energy.\u201d\n\nBut, as much as Danielia is a performer, she is also a proud and dedicated songwriter.\nInspiration for songwriting for Danielia comes at all hours, and her mindset is to grab the moment no matter when it comes and write it down. \u201cI\u2019ve woken up from dreams with an idea, and it was my grandfather that used to say ..God woke you up, and wants you to go get a pen and piece of paper and write it down.\u2019 Otherwise, the idea you had goes away. If you\u2019re lucky enough to get the call, you gotta pick the phone up,\u201d she says. As for when this inspiration hits, contrary to popular belief, it isn\u2019t always as a result of sadness or depression in Danielia\u2019s case. \u201cIt does tend to happen on a cloudy, rainy day, and I do agree with artists that it does happen at moody moments, or when you first wake up, when you\u2019re feeling not necessarily at the peak of happiness. But you can\u2019t always be the source for everything. I collaborate a lot. Like on ..Make U Move\u2019 I collaborated with Kareem Devlin and Shelby Gaines, who I worked with on a lot of the songs on this record. The beauty of co-writing is that when you collaborate, your co-writers take you to a place you normally wouldn\u2019t go.\u201d For example, on \u2018Make U Move,\u2019 one of the most infectious, rocking tracks on Rare Child, \u201cKareem and Shelby brought the track, and I wrote the melody and the words, and there\u2019s no way I would\u2019ve come up with that myself.\u201d\nDanielia is very candid about why she would rather wear her heart on her sleeve in her songwriting than try to deliver her music through a manufactured persona. \u201cSome people create characters to make it easier for them to perform, but that\u2019s just not me. I feel that when someone pays to come see me, they\u2019re coming to see me, and so I owe them that. And that\u2019s more interesting to me. Rock \u2018n roll is real, and that\u2019s what people want.\u201d Danielia describes Rare Child as \u201ca party, in a sense. It starts out saying ..I\u2019m gonna rock your world\u2019 but then it arcs, has some soulful moments, and has some upbeat moments. Like going to a really good party, it isn\u2019t all non-stop ..woo-hoo.\u2019 You might get into a deep conversation with someone in one corner and share a joke with someone else in another. It\u2019s an experience.\u201d\nIn making Rare Child Danielia\u2019s goal was to create an album that she could really play. \u201cI think this is an album that the audience wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd because we didn\u2019t try to write singles or do anything like that, it came out being a real rock \u2018n roll album, and that\u2019s exactly the way you have to go about it. And when you\u2019re lucky, it ends up being this great effort, which I think it is.\u201d\nThe meaning behind the album title is at once personal and universal for Danielia. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there, I don\u2019t see too many Black girls slinging guitars. And I know they\u2019re out there\u2014Tracy Chapman, Toshi Reagon\u2014but in the venues I\u2019m doing and the genre I\u2019m doing, a lot of times it\u2019s just me. Music is so manufactured nowadays. I feel I go back more to the classics, and Rare Child just reminds me of more of the 70\u2019s feel, and I think this album is a throwback to a time when music was less produced and a little bit more honest, accessible and realer. It doesn\u2019t make it better or worse than anything that\u2019s out there now, it just makes it what it is. Which is a little rare for right now. But a lot of people want that.\u201d The Philadelphia Daily News concurs, saying \u201c\u201cDanielia\u2019s music has the swagger of Let It Bleed-era Rolling Stones, her singing has the raw emotional power of Janis Joplin and her songwriting places her among the top new musical storytellers.\u201d\n\nNow releasing Rare Child on Adrenaline Records/ADA, Danielia has put her remarkable voice, heart, and soul into a record that truly rocks.

MPress, distributed worldwide by Caroline/Universal via SRG-ILS Group, also releases albums by Rachael Sage, Seth Glier, and A Fragile Tomorrow.\n\nGrace Pettis is an award-winning songwriter from Austin, Texas who is a noted member of the South Austin scene. A little bit folk, a little bit country/Americana and with a whole lot of soul, Pettis has released two DIY albums and the Dallas Morning News has hailed her as \"one of the most talented young singer-songwriters in America\".\n\nPettis first came to the attention of MPress founder and President Rachael Sage at a SXSW party in Austin, where her voice and presence, even totally unplugged in a crowded room, commanded the spotlight. Sage gushes, \"Grace Pettis is one of the best singers I have ever had the pleasure to hear. And when I say 'best', I don't mean that in a showy way -\u2013 although her voice is both powerful and beautiful. I mean that she can tell a story with her voice in a way that cuts right to the heart of our collective humanity, whatever the topic may be. Her songwriting is nothing short of masterful, and to see these timeless qualities in someone so young feels like discovering something akin to the magic of Loretta Lynn, Johnny Cash or perhaps, Brandi Carlile. MPress Records is thrilled to be working with Grace!\"\n\nPettis, who is repped by Chas Management, will be touring the southeastern US and Europe in winter/spring 2020. Her first release on MPress is expected later on in the year. In the meantime, she is eager to have found such a supportive new team. \"Signing a record deal sounds pretty daunting\", Pettis admits. \"It's not a decision to take lightly. But from the first conversation with Rachael Sage and her wonderful team, I've felt like I've finally found my way home. After a decade of releasing my own music, I couldn't be more thrilled to announce that I'm partnering with MPress Records, a label that has built its unique reputation on championing and supporting artists and putting music with integrity out into the world. I'm so proud to be a part of the MPress family.\"\n\nAs a card-carrying member of the south Austin scene, Grace Pettis has amassed bragging rights to spare. She is the winner of many of the nation\u2019s most prestigious songwriting contests, including NPR's Mountain Stage NewSong Contest, and has received grants from the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation. Grace\u2019s songs have been recorded by other esteemed artists, including Sara Hickman and Ruthie Foster and she added to her songwriting accomplishments in 2019 by signing a publishing deal with BMG.

Though he remains among the most pop-friendly of today's singer-songwriters - his songs regularly appear in hit movie and TV soundtracks , fans say he has bridged the gulf between the modern folk sound and the populist traditions of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger more successfully than any of his songwriting peers.

OffBeat named him the Crescent City\u2019s Best Guitarist for the third year in a row, and the Best Songwriter for the second straight year. Osborne also won Song Of The Year for his composition, Louisiana Gold.\n\nOsborne has earned hordes of new fans. He has toured virtually non-stop, either with his own band, as a solo artist, or as a guest with his countless musical admirers, including Toots and The Maytals, Stanton Moore, Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes, Keb Mo, The Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh and Karl Denson\u2019s Tiny Universe. He\u2019s produced and played on critically acclaimed albums by Tab Benoit, Johnny Sansone and Mike Zito.\n\nSince his recording debut in 1989, Osborne has written virtually all of his own material and contributed memorable songs to a wide variety of artists. Two tunes co-written by Osborne appear on Keb Mo\u2019s Grammy-winning 1999 release Slow Down. Country superstar Tim McGraw scored a #1 hit with Anders\u2019 song Watch The Wind Blow By.

The band performed on the Warped Tour and other high profile gigs before dissolving. But heavy metal was never Jordan\u2019s passion; it was just a fun experience with his friends to grow musically. As a child, Jordan grew up with R&B artists like Sam Cooke and Earth Wind & Fire providing the soundtrack to his frequent road trips to a ski resort with his family. Artists from what his father called \u201cthe good music era.\u201d Those were the sounds and stylings that stuck in Jordan\u2019s musical memory and by the time he was old enough to realize that his own singing voice was a gift, it was those early groove-funk-soul singers that had shaped his personal aesthetic. If he was going to make records, those were the kind of influences he wanted to draw from.\n\nAfter his move from California to Nashville, Jordan was invited to participate in an unsigned artists retreat hosted by Centricity Music. It was the combination of Jordan\u2019s nuanced vocal abilities, the freshness of his retro-influenced melodies and songwriting, and his warm, enthusiastic personality that spurred label execs to take a closer look and ultimately sign him.\n\nJordan Feliz\u2019s debut project, Beloved, brings the rich influence of 70\u2019s sensibilities into a modern pop context. Intentionally constructing uncluttered tracks free of production tricks and excessive instrumentation, Jordan instead focused on arrangements that were designed to give the vocals center stage. The songs on the Beloved 10 song album are soul-influenced pop numbers, and the instruments present are articulate in their voicings and melodies, saying only as much as they need to.\n\n\u201cI was the kid growing up with the headphones on listening to every lick and reading the lyrics,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cMy dad had a collection of cassettes. My mom had some vinyl. I discovered artists like the Commodores, Bill Withers, and Nat King Cole through them. When I was in the studio making Beloved, I told my producers I didn\u2019t want thirty guitars stacked on one track. I didn\u2019t want five different guitar tones. I want to put one guitar sound on a song and find a way to make that one lick sound massive, the way those 70\u2019s artists were able to do. If you stack too many sounds on one track you can lose the song in all that clutter. Building \u2018clean\u2019 tracks on Beloved was very intentional.\u201d\n\nTag-team produced by Colby Wedgeworth (Lincoln Brewster, The Main, Lydia) and Josh Silverberg (Newsboys, Jon Foreman, Plumb), Beloved has plenty of radio-friendly pop melodies that manages to hit those marks without compromising Jordan\u2019s unique musical personality. The best example of his singular vision is the record\u2019s powerhouse first single, \u201cThe River.\u201d While it sounds like a pulse-quickening mega-hit from the first listen\u2014instantly singable and repeatedly listenable\u2014 the song actually rides on a deep current of soul-driven funk influence that serves to set it apart from other contemporary radio fare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big melody guy,\u201d Jordan admits, \u201cand musically \u2018The River\u2019 is my own personal happy place. It\u2019s a great driving groove that just feels good to sing. The song itself is an invitation to anyone who hears it\u2014whether they\u2019re stuck in pride and legalism or wallowing down in the mess they\u2019ve made of their lives\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to take whatever we have and to run to Jesus. It\u2019s an invitation to go down in amazing grace and to rise up being made new.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s title track, while every bit as soulful and catchy as the first single, was penned from a more personal and autobiographical posture. Jordan\u2019s wife was about to give birth to their first child, and Jordan began to consider what he, as a new father, would most want to communicate to the daughter he was about to meet.\n\n\u201cI wrote \u2018Beloved\u2019 before she was born,\u201d he says, \u201cand I wrote it with two guys who both had little girls. The thing I really wanted my daughter to grow up knowing was that no matter what the world tells her, she\u2019s beloved. She\u2019s loved beyond compare. Regardless of what any of the people around her think, she doesn\u2019t have to be concerned with measuring up because I\u2019m gonna love her unconditionally as long as she lives. She\u2019s beloved and that\u2019s a love she was born into without having to earn it. I wrote it for her, but of course the parallel of God\u2019s unconditional love for His children is obvious. Anything I feel for my daughter is just a small echo of what God feels for her and for all of us.\u201d\n\nWith its slow build and towering vocal hooks, \u201cBeloved\u201d will doubtless provide one of the cornerstones of Jordan\u2019s energetic live shows, along with \u201cThe River,\u201d a festive cut that reveals some of the artist\u2019s roots as a worship leader, and the laid back grooving track, \u201cSimple.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my record has a theme, it\u2019s probably summed up in the \u2018Simple lyric,\u2019\u201d Jordan explains. \u201cI really just wanted this to be a project that people would smile when they listened to it. I wanted to write songs that would make people feel loved. I want them to feel good. Whatever the complications of life that we might be going through at any given moment, our relationships with Jesus don\u2019t have to be difficult. We have a tendency to make it so much harder on ourselves than it really is. We think God can\u2019t love us because we\u2019re struggling with something or we messed up somewhere. But it\u2019s not that complicated. God loves us. Our ransom has been paid. The emotional baggage we carry around doesn\u2019t change the truth. We belong to God and He loves us. It really is that simple. We just have to be constantly reminded of that. The work has already been done on the cross. We just have to remind ourselves and each other to believe it.\u201d\n\nHaving just navigated a long and rocky transition after leaving the security of his local music connections, a church staff position, and moving from California to Tennessee, Jordan Feliz and his wife experienced firsthand what it means to learn to rest in the simplicity of faith in a Father who daily provides for the needs of His children. In fact, they set out from California without even enough money to make it past Phoenix. But along each leg of the journey some music gig opened up that provided enough funds to drive the next leg. By the time they reached their new home, Jordan had actually made several hundred dollars from the move.\n\n\u201cWe believed God had made it clear from the beginning we should move to Nashville,\u201d Jordan says, \u201cbut that didn\u2019t mean it was easy. After we got here I couldn\u2019t find a job. My wife and I were sharing one car. I was posting handyman ads on Craigslist and working as a valet downtown. I could hardly get any people to write songs with me. Then we found out we were pregnant and there was so much that seemed up in the air and kind of scary. In the last few months though, it\u2019s just been like this whirlwind of good things falling into place. I signed the record deal with Centricity Music in February of this year and I finished the Beloved record July 5th. Then, I actually won a brand new car, completely out of the blue, right before my daughter was born July 20th. My first single went to radio July 31st. After so much difficulty and uncertainty, God answered our prayers. He is there for all of us and all we have to do is remain faithful.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join an exclusive VIP video call with Jordan Feliz and experience a rare opportunity to ask questions and hear directly from one of your favorite artists!

On this recording, Valdes is again featured with his Afro-Cuban Messengers, and the compositions include nods to flamenco, the Gnawa music of Morocco and the ritual rhythms of the Orishas, the deities of the Afro-Cuban Santer\u00eda religion. There are mentions of hard-bop and danz\u00f3n but also echoes of Bach, Rachmaninoff and Miles Davis -- and yet the sum total is a deeply personal and open-ended sound. And it\u2019s all Chucho Vald\u00e9s.\n\n\u201cSince I was a student I had this idea of taking disparate elements, mixing them and seeing what happened. And little by little, over time, I\u2019ve found my ways,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cAnd I love it because it\u2019s a search that forces you to investigate and study. It\u2019s not all about Afro-Cuban music. I\u2019m always looking for new things.\u201d\n\nThe concept in Border-Free \u201cwas to do many different things but all in my own style. Now, that is something very difficult to achieve.\u201d\n\nDionisio Jes\u00fas \"Chucho\" Vald\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, was born in a family of musicians in Quivic\u00e1n, Havana province, Cuba, October 9, 1941. His first teachers were his father, the pianist, composer and bandleader Ram\u00f3n \u201cBebo\u201d Vald\u00e9s, and his mother Pilar Rodr\u00edguez, who sang and played the piano.\n\nAt the age of three, Chucho already played at the piano, using both hands, in any key, melodies he heard on the radio. In fact, there is a famous anecdote that tells the story of Bebo tricking his friend, the late Israel \u201cCachao\u201d Lopez, about checking out, with his back to the player, \u201ca young North American pianist.\u201d Chucho was then four years old.\n\nAt the age of five, Chucho began to take lessons on piano, theory and solfege with maestro Oscar Mu\u00f1oz Boufartique. He continued his studies at the Conservatorio Municipal de M\u00fasica de la Habana, from which he graduated at 14. Chucho also took private lessons from Zenaida Romeu, Rosario Franco, Federico Smith and Leo Brouwer.\n\n\u201cAt home he played jazz: the music of Ellington, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller\u2019s band. I\u2019ve been privileged. Because Bebo was the piano player at the Tropicana I could see true legend of jazz in person. He took me to see Nat King Cole, Errol Garner and Sarah Vaughan when I was child studying music. You can\u2019t imagine the effect that had on my life! It was enormous! Magical!\nAt 15 Chucho formed his first jazz trio end in December 1958 he worked as a pianist at the Deauville and St. John hotels in Havana. In 1959, he debuted with the orchestra Sabor de Cuba, directed by his father, Bebo. That band accompanied the top singers of that era such as Rolando Laserie, Fernando \u00c1lvarez and P\u00edo Leyva.\n\n\u201cMy father taught me everything about Cuban music, South American music, jazz, and how to work with an orchestra,\u201d reminisces Chucho. \u201c He gave me the piano chair, and stayed on as director, so I could learn how to work under a conductor. We did our shows and a million other things with that orchestra, including accompanying shows at the Havana Hilton. I learned a lot there. He is my idol, \u201che pauses, then continues. \u201cI don\u00b4t say was, my idol. He is my idol. He was my teacher. He still is.\u201d\n\nChucho\u2019s family and professional life took a dramatic turn in 1960 when his father left to work in Mexico and from there he moved to Europe, where he eventually settled. Bebo Vald\u00e9s never returned to Cuba. (Father and son saw each other again 18 years later at Carnegie Hall, where Chucho was debuting in the United States with his group Irakere. The relationship was fully restored in 2000, when they met again to play a duet on Calle 54, a film about Latin jazz by Oscar winning Spanish director Fernando Trueba. The father and son reunion culminated, musically, in Juntos Para Siempre, a 2007 duet recording that won both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy. Bebo Vald\u00e9s died on March 22, 2013. He was 94.)\n\nIn the early \u201860s, Chucho worked as a pianist at the Teatro Mart\u00ed (1961), the Sal\u00f3n Internacional del Hotel Habana Riviera (1963) and the orchestra of the Teatro Musical de la Habana (1964-67). In 1967, and after a suggestion of his old teacher, the great guitarist, composer and director Leo Brouwer, Chucho organized his own combo.\n\nStill, that same year he joins the important Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, then directed by maestros Armando Romeu and Rafael Somavilla. While a member of the orchestra, Chucho revisited the idea of a small group and, in 1970, he appeared at the Jazz Jamboree in Poland leading his own quintet.\n\nIn 1972, after recording Jazz Bat\u00e1, an album featuring an unusual jazz trio comprising bassist Carlos del Puerto and singer and percussionist Oscar Vald\u00e9s on bat\u00e1 (the traditional hourglass shaped drums used in the ritual music of the Orishas), Chucho decided to enlarge the group adding brass and trap drums. That\u00b4s the genesis, in 1973, of Irakere, a small, Cuban-style big band that played an explosive mix of jazz, rock, classical music and traditional Cuban music, including Afro-Cuban religious music and instruments.\n\n\u201cThe ideas for the brass have to do with the work we did with the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, which was a great big band,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cI tried to imitate that with four horns -- two trumpets, a alto and a tenor sax -- and with just that try to have the sound of a big band. Of course when you have monster players like Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, [trumpeter] Jorge Varona and [saxophonist] Carlos Averhoff you can write anything you want and it will work.\u201d\nIrakere first made its mark internationally in Finland in 1976. But the following year, the band was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie in a visit to Havana on a jazz cruise that also included pianist Earl \u201cFatha\u201d Hines and saxophonist Stan Getz. In 1978 the producer Bruce Lundvall, then president of CBS, signed the band for the label. Irakere debuted, unannounced, as \u201csurprise guests,\u201d at Carnegie Hall as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. As fate would have it, the program that night also featured pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, two of Chucho\u2019s main influences.\n\nSelections from Irakere\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival comprised the repertory of Irakere (CBS) their debut recording in the United States. The album won a Grammy as Best Latin Recording in 1979.\n\nThe group went on to create an extraordinary body of work that includes great dance recordings such as Homenaje a Beny Mor\u00e9 (Pimienta, 1989) and Indestructible (Sony, 1997); explorations of Afro-Cuban religious music such as Babal\u00fa Ay\u00e9 (Bemb\u00e9, 1999) featuring the great Orisha music singer L\u00e1zaro Ros; as well as ambitious projects such as Tierra En Trance (Are\u00edto, 1983) and Misa Negra (Messidor, 1987)\n\nIrakere\u2019s lineup went through many changes over the years. Throughout, Chucho remained as the one, great constant. But success had its costs. Except for the remarkable solo outing Lucama (Mission, 1986), his talent as a pianist was largely out of sight, obscured by his other obligations with the band.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1997, Chucho won his second Grammy for his work on Habana (Verve) as a member of trumpeter Roy Hargrove\u2019s Crisol. The following year, while not completely leaving Irakere behind, Chucho started a parallel career as a solo player and quartet leader, looking for greater opportunities to explore and showcase his playing.\n\n\u201cTwenty five years with the same band is a long time,\u201d said Chucho at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to play solo and with a quartet for some time now.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011.

Inspired by the gothic humor of Edward Gorey and Tim Burton, the noir storytelling of Raymond Chandler, the murder ballads of the Americana tradition, and the dramatic flair of the cabaret, they write songs that tell stories, exploring themes like love, death, crime, ancient mythology, and the paranormal\u2014exploring the various kinds of trouble a couple of people can get into with a ukulele and a guitar.\n\nTheir song \u201cGhost Story\u201d was featured on the hit podcast Welcome To Night Vale, and appears on Charming Disaster\u2019s debut album, Love, Crime & Other Trouble (2015), described by New York Music Daily as \u201ctwistedly delicious\u2026if you aren\u2019t hooked on this by now, there\u2019s no hope for you.\u201d\n\nCharming Disaster\u2019s new album, Cautionary Tales, expands on the duo\u2019s spooky, offbeat universe of paranormal romance, circus and carnival characters, con artists, and Egyptian mythology with new songs about espionage, occult practices, supernatural creatures, and the end of the world as we know it, with references to cult fantasy novels as well as ancient lore from Greek and Norse mythology.\n\n\u201cCharming Disaster sound like the music that Pugsley and Wednesday Addams might have made after listening to the Decemberists, Squeeze and some Chopin.\u201d -Yes!

Added to that thick and intriguing sound are a series of dark and ironic lyrics, combining the mood and tone of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds with the narrative force of The Decemberists or a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Adam Turla fills out these sometimes frightening, sometimes beautiful lyrics by conjuring up a cast of character voices, allowing the songs to speak with the force of the characters themselves, and providing the listener with a sense of ensemble unique in rock music.\n\nBut this ensemble feel is not only the result of Turla's vocal playfulness, but of the cohesive playing of the band itself. Sarah Balliet channels her Kentucky bluegrass roots through the skilled hands of a concert cellist, playing point and counterpoint to the lyrics and guitars with magnificent grace and style. [bandmember from=2000]Matt Armstrong's bass guitar provides the rhythmic framework of the band, but also takes the lead with surprising frequency, guiding Murder by Death into driving highs and brooding lows. And Alex Schrodt's drumsticks almost dance across the skins, giving the band what the Chicago Reader called \"a rhythm section Nick Cave or The Faint would die for.\" The result is a fascinating slice of American Gothic, replete with trail rides, whiskey shots and Old Scratch himself.\n\nMurder By Death were discovered in 2000 by Thursday vocalist, Geoff Rickly, when the two bands played on the same bill at a gig in their hometown of Bloomington, Indiana. Rickly introduced the band, known at the time as Little Joe Gould, to his friend Alex Saavedra (owner of Eyeball Records), who signed the group immediately. Rickly performs discreet background vocals in the song Killbot 2000. The Little Joe Gould EP was issued in 2001, the group later deciding on changing the name to Murder By Death, which they felt better represented the \"Americana noir and dramatic post-punk\" of their sound.\n\nMurder by Death's unique sound has developed over several years of touring and recording. Constantly evolving their sound, the style changes from their first release Like The Exorcist, But More Breakdancing to their sophomore release, Who Will Survive, and What Will Be Left of Them?. \"Who Will Survive...\" grew from a small, limited pressing album into a sleeper hit as they constantly toured the country, sharing the stage with bands as diverse as The Weakerthans, Rasputina, Lucero, Against Me!, and William Elliott Whitmore. \"Who Will Survive...\"'s rich narrative structure, which recounted the travails of a small western town besieged by the devil, not only garnered popular and critical attention, but inspired a number of artistic reactions and responses, including ballet and stage productions, paintings, and even a PhD thesis.\n\nThe band's third album, entitled \"In Bocca al Lupo\", forgoes the integrated narrative structure of \"Who will Survive..., \" presenting the listener with an album built on thematic connections. \"In Bocca al Lupo,\" which translates roughly to \"In the Mouth of the Wolf\" (a phrase said before students take exams in Italian classrooms, and to which the students respond \"Kill the Wolf\"), examines themes of sin, transgression, punishment, and redemption, touching on different lives and different stories in each individual song. The resulting album resembles the 1979 murder mystery from which the band takes its name-a pastiche of bad deeds and good intentions, of last minute heroism and, in some cases, nearly impossible forgiveness.\n\nMusically, \"In Bocca al Lupo\" is as diverse as the various stories that the album recounts. The songs themselves reflect the stories they tell-gritty rock and roll beats drive \"Brother\" and \"Sometimes the Line Walks You,\" complex tango rhythms twine themselves through \"One More Notch,\" and lonely western guitars accompany the simple elegance of \"Shiola\" and \"Raw Deal.\" Each of the album's ballads and waltzes, chants and hard hitting rock songs, meld content and form, creating meaning in the music itself. Murder by Death's unique musical aesthetic ties these seemingly disparate tracks together. With the help of producer J. Robbins (Jets to Brazil, Jawbox, Against Me!) the lush melodies and harmonies so unique to the band transform these varied sounds into a coherent and cohesive album, an album whose overall sound and sensibility melds the darkest moments of Modest Mouse's \"Good News for People Who Love Bad News\" with the maudlin country roots of Western folk-rock. The band's thick, fretted, knotty sound provides a through line, tying together an album as musically diverse as the backcountry roads and basement rooms that inspired it.\n\n\"In Bocca al Lupo,\" on Tent Show Records, the band's own label, shows off Murder by Death's maturity, both as songwriters and musicians. The album is alternately rough and gentle, elegant and complex, intelligent and playful; it moves from one to the other without breaking stride, without interrupting the album as whole. Murder by Death is known for their talent as performers, for their live presence, the ambiance and energy present in their music. \"In Bocca al Lupo\" harnesses this energy and distills it, adding to it the maturity of a band constantly on the road.\n\nRed Of Tooth And Claw\n\nMurder By Death's fourth album, and first with Vagrant Records was released in March 2008, entitled Red Of Tooth And Claw. Produced by Trina Shoemaker at Dark Horse Studios in Tennessee, the record features former keyboardist Vincent Edwards on the song \"Ball & Chain\" and is also the first album to feature new drummer Dagan Thogerson, who replaced founding member Alex Schrodt. It continues with the band's trademark themes: \"lust, betrayal, and classical archetypes of good and evil.\" In Turla's words, the record is an \"Homer\u2019s Odyssey of revenge, only without the honorable character at the center.\" The vocals are again sung in the same low, baritone range as In Bocca Al Lupo causing many critics to speculate that Red Of Tooth And Claw breaks less new ground than previous efforts, although in general the album has been well received. As described by allmusic.com the album \"carries over some of the Old West outlaw feel of its predecessor, but it's more aggressive and freewheeling here. [...] [The album] isn't a departure for Murder By Death, but their ability to keep their sound fresh and vibrant speaks well of their musical abilities.\" To celebrate the album's release, Murder By Death played two shows on the same night in their hometown of Bloomington.\n\nMembers\nAdam Turla - vocals, guitars\nSarah Balliet - cello, keys\nDagan Thogerson - percussion\nMatt Armstrong - bass\n\nPrevious members\nVincent Edwards - keys (left the band in 2004 to pursue an art degree)\nBrandon Cooper - keys mid-2004\nAlex Schrodt - percussion through mid-2007", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Consider the Source LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9328095.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Prog-rock, Jam Bands, Psychedelic Rock, Metal, Rock, Instrumental, Stoner Metal, World Fusion", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sci-fi fusion trio Consider the Source defy easy categorization.

With their blend of progressive rock and improvisatory jazz, soaked in Indian and Middle Eastern styles, CTS blends disparate elements into an utterly original whole. A relentless touring schedule has earned them a fervent following around the world, with fans ranging from jam-band hippies to corpse-painted headbangers.\n\nTheir latest album, You Are Literally a Metaphor, is the culmination of a fifteen-year musical journey. Packed with the same fury and dazzling virtuosity of their previous work, Metaphor is also a portrait of three musicians reaching new levels of maturity.\n\nFrom the bluesy swing of \u201cWhen You\u2019ve Loved and Lost Like Frankie Has\u201d to the ethereal electro-synths of \u201cSketches From a Blind Man\u201d, CTS\u2019s minimalist pop instincts stand shoulder-to-shoulder with progressive metal and freewheeling improvisation in a true expression of their omnivorous musicality. Three of Metaphor\u2019s nine songs are Eastern European traditionals, but could easily be mistaken for the band\u2019s original tunes, so singular has their sound become. CTS retain their signature fiery maximalism while pushing the hooky, anthemic songwriting to the forefront. Bassist John Ferrara\u2019s new Taurus bass pedals and guitarist Gabriel Marin\u2019s new custom Vigier double-neck guitar add new dimensions to the band\u2019s already diverse sound.\n\nThis is an album born of comfort and growth. In the five years since World War Trio, the band has toured extensively, Marin and Ferrara have released side projects, and drummer/percussionist Jeff Mann has gone from a relative newcomer to a road-hardened veteran. After all this time, CTS knows how to create space for each other, how to finish each other\u2019s musical thoughts and sentences, how to think as three individuals but speak with one voice. You Are Literally a Metaphor is a statement of confidence, an assertion of identity from a band with no reservations and nothing to prove.\n\nCTS have performed in a half-dozen countries across three continents. They have shared the stage with a wide variety of artists, including: Victor Wooten, King Crimson Projekt, Wyclef Jean, Ozric Tentacles, Soulive, The Disco Biscuits, Papadosio, Turkuaz, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, Wayne Krantz and many others.

Hannah always knew she wanted to be an entertainer, but it wasn't until she was ten years old that she made her debut solo performance at her fourth grade Christmas Recital. She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music. The results were evident when her fan base exploded and has continued to grow ever since. Hannah returned to Nashville to continue performing and writing. Her hard work paid off when she secured four song cuts on the debut album of country artist, Rachele Lynae, on Momentum Label Group. Hannah's newest project, \"The Freedom EP\", was released on Thanksgiving Day 2012. Her current single from the project, \"No Where Left to Roam\" has been sent to Country, Americana, College and Internet radio around the world and is receiving an enthusiastic response. \"The Freedom EP\" includes five original tracks and is available now on all major online stores including iTunes and Amazon, as well as her website.

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories. Park spins a different perspective .., going even deeper and more introspective .. in Me,\u201d a song about a man who hits rock bottom and realizes his need to adjust his course. \"Daniel Park has distilled what it is to be a singer songwriter in the late oughts, and in doing this, has created a blueprint that every individual with an acoustic guitar and a microphone should follow for the next decade.\" - James @ NeuFutur.com www.danielparkmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "KDJabove HQ LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8705875.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Dub, House, Hip Hop, Jazz Soul & Funk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "KDJ Above is a groundbreaking music performer straight out of Denver.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee. Bandmembers from both Umphrey's and Bisco have further more found each other in The Brain Damaged Eggmen, a Pink Floyd and The Beatles coverband\n\n\nDiscography\n\n* Encephalous Crime (self-released, 1996)\n* Uncivilized Area (1998)\n* Bisco Lives (2000)\n* They Missed the Perfume (2001)\n* Se\u00f1or Boombox (2002)\n* TranceFusion Radio Broadcast Vol. 1-4 (2003)\n* Wind at Four to Fly (2006)\n* Rocket 3 (2007)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Katy Marquardt LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9188128.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Country, Rap, Rock, Cover Band, R&b", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Katy Marquardt is a piano entertainer based in Chicago, Illinois, but she has played all over the world and even at sea.

But the South Korea born, New Mexico raised performer hardly realized just how dynamically his skills on the instrument would mesh with his ultimate development as a rocker in the popular regional bands Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and now, his emergence as a powerful and emotional singer/songwriter in his own right. On his debut album These Illusions, Park plays violin and acoustic guitar in addition to reaching out to acoustic rock fans everywhere with his inimitable vocals. Because of the mostly personal nature of the songs, the compelling 11-track collection rolls like a fascinating chronology of the 27-year-old singer\u2019s life, beginning with tunes he wrote when he was an engineering student at New Mexico State in his now adopted hometown of Las Cruces. He was also building his catalog of songs as he played violin and contributed backing vocals for several years in two well known regional bands: the mostly cover band Live Bait and the \u201cscreamo\u201d metalcore/hardcore group Kiss To Betray. Playing in Live Bait, his violin came in very handy for those Dave Matthews songs and it helped him take songs like Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d to a transcendent level. Live Bait won the local college radio station KRUXFEST for \u201cBest New Alternative Band\u201d in 2005 and Kiss To Betray won the Las Cruces 2006 Battle of the Bands and later played at well known venues around the country like Headhunters in Austin, The Viper Room in L.A. and hotspots in Phoenix. As a solo artist, Park has since headlined regularly at local clubs like El Patio Bar and Hurricane Alley, the Albuquerque haunts the Launch Pad and Rally\u2019s Pub on 4th Street, and in Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix and even Colorado Springs. He recently posted two live performance videos on his myspace (myspace.com/danielparkmusic), one of which features his unique looping technique which allows him to play violin and guitar \u201csimultaneously\u201d on the same song. While Park enjoyed his time in Live Bait and Kiss To Betray and the notoriety he received as a featured performer, in some ways he felt he was always gearing up for his eventual breakthrough to the forefront as his own artist. In the months leading up to the breakup of Kiss To Betray, Park gathered his best material, entered what kiddingly refers to as \u201ca local ghetto studio\u201d and started to come to grips with These Illusions. While many of the tracks on the album have their roots in romantic relationships, the hypnotic and percussive, acoustic guitar driven title cut cuts to the core of his desire to find his own creative path in life\u2014even if it means going against the mainstream expectations of our society. Other songs tap slightly into his lifelong search for identity as an Asian born man adopted (along with two of his siblings) by a white American family. Other key tracks on These Illusions include the jangling, high energy \u201cTimes Have Changed,\u201d which laments the shift in life as his significant other chooses to move on. The graceful, easy strumming ballad \u201cWhat We Should Be\u201d is another heartbreaker about learning to accept the changes in a relationship when one person leaves to pursue his or her dreams\u2014while still celebrating the memories. Park spins a different perspective .., going even deeper and more introspective .. in Me,\u201d a song about a man who hits rock bottom and realizes his need to adjust his course. \"Daniel Park has distilled what it is to be a singer songwriter in the late oughts, and in doing this, has created a blueprint that every individual with an acoustic guitar and a microphone should follow for the next decade.\" - James @ NeuFutur.com www.danielparkmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Quadrini LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/2371095.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "undefined, Brazil", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Brazilian DJ/Producer", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Patrick Fleming Music LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10284446.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Rock Americana", "Time": "12:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Welcome to Patrick Fleming Music, a place for all things PF MUSIC: PF Solo, PF Band, PF Originals...

She is also the founder of SBS Records.\n\nMalone was born and raised in Atlanta, GA by a musician mom with whom she toured in the summers. She grew up listening to her mother and grandmother sing in the church choir every Sunday when they werent on the road. She dropped out of high school at 16 to begin work on her rock and roll degree. After a few brushes with the law and some unsavory characters, Michelle decided to go back to high school and became the valedictorian for a small class. She attended Agnes Scott College with dreams of becoming a doctor, but was offered a record deal with Clive Davis at Arista Records, which looked alot more interesting to her than more school.\n\nWhen it came time to craft her own sound, she took those religious and secular roots, blended in enough folk, blues and rock to satisfy, and came up with a rootsy high-spirited sound that brings acoustic and electric slide and passionate vocals together harkening back to the lost recordings of Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, and Lucinda Williams.\n\nAfter several major label releases, Malone is now an independent artist with 15 studio records to date and an impressive resume which includes hi profile performances with everyone from Gregg Allman to John Mayer, the Atlanta Symphony to Ellen Degeneres, various awards including best albums, 4x best singer, 3x best acoustic guitarist, and 2 Grammy ballot nominations. Her songs have appeared in such films as Bam Bam and Celeste, All Over Me, Shotgun Jesus and television programs True Blood, Dawson's Creek, Felicity, Brooklyn South. They have been recorded by Indigo Girls (for which she received both gold and platinum records), Antigone Rising, and Vistoso Bosses.\n\nMalone has always made time for philanthropic endeavors such as running the Paris marathon for Team In Training/The Leukemia Society, and cycling with Team Earth Challenge from Atlanta to Yucca Mountain, NV in protest of the nuclear waste dumping. In 2012 she started a college scholarship fund for girls in need. She currently contributes to various women's and children's non-profit organizations, and donates time to local Georgia music organizations and schools.\n\nMalone has performed for TedX Peachtree, sang the National Anthem for The Atlanta Braves and The Houston Comets, been honored with a Signature guitar slide modeled and named after her by Rocky Mountain Slides, was the keynote speaker at a SoCal high school graduation, has been the rhythm guitarist and mandolin player for Kristian Bush (Sugarland), a satellite member of the Indigo Girls, is endorsed by Supro USA Guitars and amps Reunion Blues, and Breedlove guitars and mandolins.

But not every artist gets asked by their heroes to join\nthem, as artists, on their stage. It's a compliment that Jacob Moon keeps getting from the\nmusicians who have inspired him since he started as a singer-songwriter out in Hamilton,\nOntario. Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brandon Stansell LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9869255.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Country Pop, Contemporary Country, Country", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "With Jimmie Allen\u2019s recent #1 song, Kane Brown\u2019s #1 album and recent Grammy wins for artists like Kacey Musgraves and Brandi Carlile, Country music seems to be swinging open its doors to some of the more unlikely of country artists - enter Brandon Stansell.\n\nWhen CMT premiered the video for Brandon\u2019s last single HOMETOWN in November 2018, he instantly became what they called,\u201cliving history.\u201d The premiere of this video, addressing LGBTQ themes, is a first for the home of Country Music videos.\n\nThe video then went on to be named one of Rolling Stone\u2019s Top 10 Country Music Videos of 2018.\u201d\n\n\"Country music may not be known for being inclusive to LGBTQ artists, but rising musician Brandon Stansell is redefining the genre one soulful song at a time, \u201c says Billboard\n\nHis is a bold new voice in the genre, as comfortable making you tap your foot as shed a tear - a singer songwriter with something to say, and a voice to remember.", "otherInfo": "Join Brandon Stansell in Partnership with The GRAMMY\u00ae Museum to celebrate the release of his brand new single \u201cHurt People,\u201d which includes a can\u2019t miss collaboration with fellow country artist Cam!

A fan on Jim\u2019s CDBaby page summed it up this way:\n\u201cJim plays because he loves music. He plays with the same passion whether he is playing for thousands or a few fans. It is clear in every track that Jim is playing for his love of music and not just for all the hoopla. It is for this reason that this CD is a must have.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Jim Pellinger's Quarantine Cafe streams live every Friday night at 8pm CDT, on Facebook and simul-streamed on jimpellinger.com."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "s\u00e4je LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388019.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Vocal Jazz, Jazz, Contemporary Vocal Jazz, Vocal Group", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The critically acclaimed vocal supergroup, s\u00e4je, is comprised of Sara Gazarek, Amanda Taylor, Johnaye Kendrick, and Erin Bentlage.

He has sold millions of albums, charted 35 singles, 16 of which are Top 40 hits and continues to receive critical acclaim as an actor, writer, and executive producer in film and television.\n\nCyrus was born in Flatwoods, Kentucky on August 25, 1961. His father, Ron Cyrus, was a steelworker who felt a calling to serve his fellow man and became a state legislator and the head of the Kentucky AFL-CIO. He spent 21 years in the Kentucky House of Representatives before retiring from office in 1996. Ron Cyrus was also an accomplished singer in the gospel southern quartet, The Crownsmen, where Cyrus first felt the power of harmonies. (Cyrus yearned to learn how to harmonize with himself and successfully did as he was recently given the title of \u201cThe country Freddy Mercury,\u201d by fellow musician, Shooter Jennings in Rolling Stone magazine.) Additionally, his mother, Ruthie, played piano, his maternal grandfather, Papaw Casto, played the fiddle and his paternal grandfather, Papaw Cyrus, was a Pentecostal preacher. Regular family jam sessions were common in the Cyrus household and often dominated by country, gospel, and old standards.\nBefore music was a priority, Cyrus proved a talent for baseball, and attended Georgetown College on an athletic scholarship. Soon academics and baseball took a backseat to music after he first plucked a six-string. Inspiration called upon Cyrus and his brother to form a country-rock band called Sly Dog. In 1982 they landed a standing gig at an Ironton, Ohio roadhouse which convinced Cyrus to quit school and pursue music professionally. After a fire burned down their home club as well as their gear in 1984, Cyrus dismembered Sly Dog and relocated to Los Angeles in hopes of kick-starting his career. Cyrus\u2019 patience wore thin in California and he was led to pursue new opportunities. He landed at the Ragtime Lounge in Huntington, WV where he would play five nights a week, and on his days off, he would make the drive to Nashville to try and score a \u2018break\u2019.\n\nIn time, Cyrus pulled the attention of legendary music manager, Jack McFadden. Shortly after, Cyrus was invited to open before Reba McEntire in Louisville in 1990, where A&R men from Mercury Records were encouraged to attend and give him consideration. After seeing the crowd\u2019s reaction to Cyrus\u2019 set, they quickly offered him a recording contract. At that very time, Cyrus was quoted in a local newspaper article saying, \u201cThis is my Super Bowl,\u201d referring to the fact that he was either going to win it or lose it.\n\nCyrus went on to make history with the debut of his studio album, Some Gave All. The album hit No. 1 on the Billboard album charts, where it held the position for 17 consecutive weeks; a record he still holds as a solo male artist.\n\nThroughout the early 90s, Cyrus had a string of releases off the album that bulleted up the charts, including \u201cAchy Breaky Heart,\u201d \u201cCould\u2019ve Been Me,\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019m Gonna Live When I Get Home,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s Not Cryin\u2019 Anymore\u201d and the title track, \u201cSome Gave All,\u201d which earned Cyrus the Bob Hope Award for Excellence in Entertainment.\nFollowing encouragement from his dad, Cyrus began acting. He landed a role in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive in 2001. Simultaneously, Cyrus continued to create music, but casting calls were plentiful. Not too long after, he accepted the lead role in a cable television series, Doc, in which he played Dr. Clint Cassidy, a physician from the Deep South who relocates to the bright and flashy New York City.\nIn 2006, Cyrus' daughter Miley was cast in the title role of the Disney situation comedy Hannah Montana as an ordinary teenager who beams as a pop star. Cyrus co-starred as her father and manager, Robby Ray Stewart.\n\nAlthough he had become a sought after actor, he stayed committed as an always consummate singer-songwriter. As Cyrus put it, \u201cI became an actor, but I was born a singer-songwriter from Flatwoods, KY. That\u2019s who I am. I lived the music and I couldn\u2019t help but write about it.\u201d Behind the scenes, Cyrus continued to write. While watching Miley leave for California, he wrote \u201cReady, Set, Don\u2019t Go,\u201d which ultimately became a worldwide smash.\n\nIn between roles, Cyrus released Wanna Be Your Joe in 2006 and he also enjoyed chart success with the Hannah Montana album, which featured the father-daughter anthem \"Butterfly Fly Away\u201d as a duet with Miley.\nA feature film, Hannah Montana: The Movie, spawned from the popular network show. Cyrus was a producer and was integral in bringing the movie to be shot on location in Tennessee.\n\nIn January 2011, Hannah Montana concluded after 101 episodes. The conclusion of his time with Disney lead Cyrus to reflect on his career and conduct his autobiography, Hillbilly Heart, which was released in April of 2013. The autobiography unveiled his tenacious struggle to claim peace with faith, family, and the power of music.\n\nCombining much of his expertise, Cyrus appeared as the sharp lawyer, Billy Flynn, in the Broadway production of Chicago throughout the Hurricane Sandy devastation that hit much of New York City in late 2012. His next studio release, Change My Mind, was inspired by much of the disaster he witnessed during his time in the Big Apple.\n\nCurrently, Cyrus has numerous new projects in the works including the premiere of a new television series on CMT, \u201cStill The King,\u201d in which he shares writing and executive-production credits. Cyrus stars as the center role of \u201cBurnin\u2019\u201d Vernon Brown, a one-hit wonder who becomes an Elvis impersonator after a wreck into an old country church outside of Nashville during a drunken bender, he is sentenced to return and perform community service. Along the way he pretends to be the congregation\u2019s new minister and re-connects with a former one-night-stand (Joey Lauren Adams), only to discover he has a 15-year-old daughter he\u2019s never met.\n\nHis expansive career highlights his talent to the utmost. An anticipated forthcoming studio album titled Thin Line is set to release this fall. Included on the album is \u201cHey Elvis,\u201d a collaboration Cyrus re-invented with Bryan Adams and the legendary \u201cVoice of Rock,\u201d Glenn Hughes.\n\nAround the world, it is without a doubt that Billy Ray Cyrus is a household name and will continue to be recognized through generations.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "KOAH LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10353311.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Rock, Indie, Electronic, Alternative, Southern Rock", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "KOAH is an accomplished singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist active in both the United States East Coast and West Coast.

Born and raised in the Golden State, as the singer/guitarist and primary songwriter of rock band The Mother Hips, Bluhm has spent the last two decades performing, writing, collaborating on, and producing music.\n\nCalifornia is a constant source of inspiration for Bluhm, and like the wildly diverse state, his influences are sprawling, beautiful and multifarious. Bluhm\u2019s music, as an acclaimed solo artist as well as with the Hips, his duo project Skinny Singers with Jackie Greene, fronting The Rhythm Devils (featuring The Grateful Dead\u2019s Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann), Ball-Point Birds (duo with Hips co-founder Greg Loiacono), and in his wife\u2019s band Nicki Bluhm & The Gramblers, is a timeless mix of classic rock, Americana, California country, folk, psychedelic blues, and power-pop. Though varied and ambitious, Bluhm never sounds disjointed, his work always tied together by impeccable songwriting.\n\nBluhm grew up listening to eight-track tapes of Leon Russell, Jim Croce, Anne Murray, and The Beach Boys. He got his first taste of singing in the church choir and it was Neil Young\u2019s Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere that inspired him to pick up a guitar. Captivated at an early age, Bluhm has always been connected to music\u2019s spiritual capacity. \u201cThe transformative power of music is really the best part\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s why so many of us are obsessed with music.\u201d\n\nAlthough The Mother Hips were courted by major labels and signed to Rick Rubin\u2019s American Recordings while still in college, they\u2019ve yet to receive the riches of rock stardom. Instead Tim Bluhm settled into a prolific, slow-burning career adored by many yet virtually unknown in the mainstream. Along the way Bluhm has shared the stage with such luminaries as Johnny Cash, Wilco, The Black Crowes, Widespread Panic, Lucinda Williams, M. Ward, Cracker, John Hiatt, and Phil Lesh to name a few.\n\nWhile The Mother Hips were constantly touring up and down California\u2019s coast, Bluhm became infatuated with surfing. In 1997 he purchased a Toyota pick-up with a camper shell and began drifting from town to town, spending his days in the water and crashing in the truck. Standing at 6 feet 5 inches the Toyota wasn\u2019t the most comfortable accommodations and was soon replaced by a legendary van that Bluhm called home until 2003.\n\n2006 offered Bluhm, Bay Area musician Jackie Greene, and engineer Dave Simon-Baker the opportunity to open Mission Bells Studio where Bluhm has produced albums for the Hips, Jackie Greene, Hot Buttered Rum, Dave Brogan, Little Wings, and the studio has hosted Phil Lesh, Los Lobos, Rogue Wave, Jonathan Richman, Josh Ritter, and ALO.\n\nIn 2005 Bluhm teamed up with San Diego-based singer/songwriter/guitarist Steve Poltz and combined his love of the outdoors with his passion for music with The High Sierra Singer/Songwriter Workshop. The unique four day backcountry experience offers attendees the opportunity to write songs and learn from two of California\u2019s most renowned songwriters in one of the country\u2019s most amazing locations.\n\nBluhm and his bandmates further blurred the lines between Mother Nature and music by launching The Mother Hips Family Hipnic in 2009. A two day festival set in gorgeous Big Sur, CA hosted by the Hips, \u201cit\u2019s everything I like about music festivals\u201d says Bluhm; \u201cgreat acts, pristine surroundings and no crowds.\u201d 2010 was an even greater success and all signs point to an annual outing where fans will continue to flock.\n\nWhen not touring the world in a rock band, producing albums, surfing, skiing, camping and hiking, Tim Bluhm lives with his wife Nicki in their San Francisco home.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lo Marie LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8901001.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Jazz, Neo-soul, R&b", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Lo Marie is a multi-award winning Jazz/Neo-Soul artist from Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nLo Marie earned a Bachelor of Music in Voice & Economics from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

Pepper/psychedelic era, and the Abbey Road period and beyond, with many shows also including a Shea Stadium set.\n\nThe band typically changes costumes twice, for a total of three period-perfect looks: the identical black chesterfield suits worn by the original lads during their Ed Sullivan Show debut, the colorful satin Sgt. Pepper uniforms and regalia worn by the Beatles during their psychedelic era, and the totally divergent clothing styles that marked the later Beatles and post-Beatles years. Select shows also feature the beige safari-style jackets and black trousers that have come to be known as the Beatles' Shea Stadium suits.\n\nThe band also periodically plays specialty shows for various Beatles-related anniversaries, such as shows that feature an entire Beatles album, played from start to finish, along with additional selections from the rest of the Beatles' extensive catalog. True to the material and era they cover, each of these shows brings in additional, highly authentic costumes from the period.\n\nThe Fab Four truly are The Ultimate Tribute to The Beatles -- the most accurate representation of the originals you'll find this side of the 1960s!", "otherInfo": "Emmy\u00ae Award-winning Beatles tribute band The Fab Four celebrates the 50th Anniversary of LET IT BE with a LIVE recreation of the music from the Beatles' swan song.\n\nDig It!

His voice is weathered by life\u2019s detours and disappointments and strengthened by his dreams and determination. His music is infused with relentless intensity, both of passion and frustration. The boy who grew up daydreaming about life outside of the small town of Tifton, Ga., became a man who has been continually inspired by Bruce Springsteen and Kris Kristofferson to paint vivid portraits with his lyrics. \u201cI am not drawn to the fairytale kind of love,\u201d says Kip, who had a hand in writing every song on his debut album. \u201cI am drawn to the real-life experiences between a woman and a man. I try to sing about the way it is, but yet at the same time, what you can hope for between a couple. I don\u2019t intend to paint of picture of what it\u2019s really not.\u201d His music powerfully captures some of the contradictions that he grapples with personally. Although he\u2019s from a large family and enjoys musical collaborations and performing onstage, he\u2019s an introvert who is often more comfortable being alone. \u201cThere\u2019s a combativeness to the music too, a fight within,\u201d he says. \u201cWith \u2018Faith When I Fall,\u2019 I know how bad I need that spiritual realm, but yet I find myself on this other end a lot of times.\u201d Despite its edge, his music remains desperately optimistic. \u201cI am hoping for what I have yet to become,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s hopeful for what I\u2019ve yet reached, how I look forward to feeling, but I haven\u2019t gotten there yet. \u201cI have truly lived my music to a sense, even the milestones I haven\u2019t reached yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been in those moments. I\u2019ve been at those crossroads with a girl: \u2018Are we going to take that next step?\u2019 I look forward to taking that next step, but I haven\u2019t wanted to yet. I look forward to being ready for that.\u201d He was born in Tifton, near the Florida line, and was one of six children, the youngest boy who had three younger sisters. \u201cYou had to make your own fun, for sure,\u201d he says of Tifton. \u201cI had a lot of time for daydreaming. It was a great town, but I dreamed about getting out. I do enjoy going back now.\u201d His father was a golf pro and his mother was a painter who used anything handy for a canvas, whether it was cake plates or baby crates. She also taught piano and played the church organ. \u201cI can remember sleeping in the pews,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe would bring us blankets and give us a coloring book and we\u2019d sit there while she played.\u201d Weekends were often spent driving to the beach with his father for fishing expeditions. \u201cHe would play a lot of Jackson Browne, Willie Nelson, Bob Seger, Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen,\u201d he says. \u201cAs early as I can remember, I always gravitated toward lyrics. Even when I hadn\u2019t lived enough to understand then, they still shaped me. \u201c During high school, he secretly began playing his brother\u2019s guitar because he was intimidated by the talent of his mother and older brother. \u201cI would play when nobody was around, just figuring out stuff, watching his hands and trying to do the same thing.\u201d He played point guard for Wallace State\u2019s basketball team and also played on its golf team in Hanceville, Ala., for two years and then transferred to Valdolsta State University on a golf scholarship. He wrote songs daily and joined a band that performed throughout the South, providing him with all of his income. \u201cI was one of those kinds who didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do with my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know music was an option. Maybe it was one of those things where I didn\u2019t quite believe in myself enough.\u201d Although he devoted every free moment to music during college, his parents still didn\u2019t know about his musical activities. \u201cThey were all shocked when they found out about it because they didn\u2019t know I could sing or play,\u201d he says. After graduation and a short stint as a bartender on St. Simon\u2019s Island, he moved to Hawaii on a whim with just a backpack, a surfboard and a friend. They slept on an airport bench the first night and then lucked into a hut that was $50 a month. They would walk or hitchhike the mile to the beach daily. After six months of this tropical paradise, Kip thought he had found his permanent home until his friend encouraged him to pursue songwriting as a living. \u201cI didn\u2019t know a whole lot about the world of songwriting,\u201d he says. \u201cI just did it for my own enjoyment. We talked about Nashville and I ended up saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to give it a shot.\u2019 I flew back home and told my folks. They thought I was crazy. Now they\u2019ll say different, that they knew all along.\u201d He drove to Nashville on Jan. 1, 2004 in an old black Nissan truck that contained one bag and his guitar. He immersed himself in the songwriting community, observing songwriters\u2019 rounds for two years and honing his craft before gaining the confidence to join in. After four years of performing locally, he caught the attention of Creative Artist Agency\u2019s Mark Dennis, who called Universal Music Group Nashville\u2019s Joe Fisher. Not only did Joe\u2019s encounter lead to his record deal with MCA Nashville, but it also brought about his introduction to songwriter Brett James, who produced Kip\u2019s debut album. \u201cBrett gave me the freedom to find who I was as an artist, the freedom for writing a different kind of thing, a different kind of melody and lyric,\u201d he says. \u201cHe gave me room to grow.\u201d He also found important relationships with songwriters Dan Couch, Scott Steppakoff, Westin Davis and Kiefer Thompson, two of whom didn\u2019t have publishing deals when he began writing with them. \u201cThere was definitely a special thing when we got in the room together,\u201d Kip says. \u201cI got offers to write with a lot of the bigger guns in town, but I enjoyed what I was doing with them. They were open to my ideas of being different.\u201d And different his debut project is, as evidenced by the album\u2019s first single, \u201cMary Was the Marrying Kind,\u201d the story of the one who got away. The dreamy and spell-binding song is the true story of one of Kip\u2019s friends, who returned to his hometown after about six years and saw the once tall, lanky girl who had since come into her own and become a model. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of what every man in this world goes through at some point,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of the one that got away that you should have paid attention to. Every town, every city, everybody knows one. Every girl believes they are Mary.\u201d The anthemic \u201cDrive Me Crazy\u201d is the story of two troubled teens who find a safe harbor in each other, if only for a few fleeting moments. \u201cThey are the getaway car for each other from everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen they\u2019re together, what they live in is in the rear-view mirror and it\u2019s just one big infatuation love story that lasts for a very short time. With its irresistible bass line and drums, \u201cUp All Night\u201d is about continuing to live life to its fullest. \u201c\u2019Up All Night\u2019 is the story of not wanting to give into your age and how life is supposed to be lived once you reach a certain age,\u201d he says. When Kip plays shows, he\u2019s often asked for advice by aspiring songwriters. \u201cEverybody\u2019s experience is different, but I do believe it has to be the only thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can be a gray line. Either you want it and there\u2019s nothing else or it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d For instance, Kip was offered a sales position with an enticing salary, but it required working six days a week, leaving no time for creating music. \u201cYou come to the crossroads: do you really want this? Are you willing to sacrifice everything, including relationships? I can\u2019t tell you how many relationships have been doomed from the get-go because of this. \u201cIt only took me a few minutes to decline it. It\u2019s such a risk and it\u2019s an alone feeling \u2013 you feel like you\u2019re on an island by yourself \u2013 but it\u2019s worth every single minute.

Lamar Blvd., Austin, TX. The band recently headlined The Beaumont Blues and Jazz Festival , and backed the legendary Barbara Lynn on her hits such as 'You'll Loose a Good Thing' and 'I'm A Good Woman'. A true honor for Lisa with her deep love and passion for the women of early Soul/R&B and Blues.\n\nThe band's live performance is an ever evolving sound of folk/funk, garage R&B jam, and improv, taking the songs and the audience on a unique journey every performance.\n\u201cThe cocktail that is her music (a funky, soulful blues) can\u2019t really be called fusion, but more a stirred Motown mixer. Lisa Marshall is on the fast track of positioning herself as one Austin\u2019s staple female artists.\u201d -Steven Blythe, Austin Post\n\nLisa moved to Austin in Spring of 2009 and begin playing such rooms as Continental Club, Saxon Pub, and Antone\u2019s, having the opportunity to share stages with Lavelle White, Barbara Lynn, Doyle Bramhall, W.C. Clark, Patrice Pike and Sister 7, Carolyn Wonderland, Malford Milligan, Bill Carter and more.\n\nShe hails most recently from Seattle. There she performed solo with, \u201cThe Blonde\u201d, her semi-hollow body electric guitar, and was often joined by the raucous, three part call-and-answer trio, The Dirty Girls! She released her first solo CD titled \u2018Simple\u2019 in May of 2008. The group was invited to the famous Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, TN. as the feature for The Sunday \u2018Songwriter\u2019s Spotlight\u2019. \u2018Simple\u2018 can be heard in regular rotation on KOOP, KAZI ;Austin, TX., WWOZ; New Orleans, LA. and various radio in Europe as well as making it on to 2 Top 5 Euro-Americana Charts.\n\".. her (LisaMarshall) voice belts and soars through the building lyrics then dips to a restrained contralto for climatic lines. Hints of reverb in the production space add a subtle, creepy effect to the gospel tunes. It could almost be too crafted, but with Marshall's spellbinding voice pulling at the tempo, the album feels so organic that you can't imagine it any other way.\"- Rachel Dovey, Seattle Sound Magazine\nMarshall's debut solo album 'Simple' was a one woman project with Lisa recording, mixing and playing every instrument on the album except Track 1 & 3; Scotty X on Bass, Track 6; E. Pruitt on Bass, Track 3 & 4; Eric Manegold on Drums, Track 2 & 5; Kevin Fallon on Lead Guitar, Track 5; Nick Salzetti on Drums. The title track Simple drums were recorded with a single sennheiser dynamic microphone placed in the middle of the drum set above the kick drum.\n\nBorn and raised in Virginia Beach, VA, she spent her early years on the Chesapeake Bay. Her young parents possessed a large vinyl collection; Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, Motown, Funk to Disco, was a constant in the house. Lisa remembers hours of sitting on the sand filled carpet with the album insert of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young 4 Way Street, reading the lyrics and singing along to 'Cowgirl In The Sand' with her younger sister. \"I have always loved harmonies. I loved that album for their harmonies. Looking back it's so fitting that I would sing that song. Living literally across the street from the beach our carpet sounded like a giant bean bag when you walked on it. I guess I thought I was the cowgirl.\" (laughs)...more like a gypsy\"\n\nAt the age of 21, Marshall moved to California. It was in L.A. where she co-founded and fronted Peculiar Boogie with Rebekah Coltman (guitar) & Susan Joyner (keys) for a decade. Their band was a unique blend of female fronted \u201cBrit\u201d Rock featuring R&B style vocals and harmonies. The band played and showcased at some of L.A\u2019s hot spots such as Troubadour, and the Roxy. Robben Ford, Koko Taylor, and Big Brother and the Holding Company are some of the acts that Peculiar Boogie supported. The band received air play in California and Europe regularly. Lisa also had the honor of singing with Big Brother and the Holding Company.\n\nCurrently Lisa had been debuting new songs with her band live around Austin. She continues to create new music for an upcoming EP to be released in 2016. Lisa has been selected from over 900 musicians in Austin to the list of Black Fret/Patrons of Live Music.

The vocal performance by band co-founder Serena Pryne was so gut-wrenching and so emotionally draining, mining the very depths of her soul that she practically collapsed into the arms of superstar producer GGGarth Richardson when it was over. That vocal take and the similarly powerhouse performances from her bandmates, came to be the template and benchmark for the rest of the album. \u201cI knew it was a powerful song with a lot of emotion behind it and I was a little intimidated to record it\u201d said Pryne. \u201cHe let me do my thing and just pour everything I had into the microphone. He said I would know when I was done.\u201d From that moment on, that song set the tone for the rest of the record. \u201cI don\u2019t know if GGGarth knew it ahead of time and planned it with that song, because he would always reference Don\u2019t Ask if we were struggling at any other moment. He set the entire tone based on that track,\u201d said guitarist and band co-founder Nick Lesyk. The entirety of Windows and Stones is just as creatively, spiritually and emotionally intense and takes the listener on an aural and experiential journey that they won\u2019t soon forget. This too is emblematic of The Mandevilles\u2019 \u2018leave it all on the floor\u2019 approach to writing, recording and especially performing the music live. And it\u2019s music that couldn\u2019t be more straightforward and unpretentious in its approach and delivery. No studio trickery, experimental flights of fancy or self-indulgence - just rock and roll. \u201cBeing a Canadian, I think it\u2019s funny that I describe it as American rock and roll. I say that because it\u2019s reminiscent of Tom Petty, John Mellencamp, Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen - all rolled into one. Our music comes from the same place.\u201d said Lesyk. Pryne and Lesyk are the creative nucleus of The Mandevilles and have been musical partners for nearly 15 years, although both bring significantly different musical influences to the table. \u201cSerena\u2019s influences are steeped more in the roots of rock and roll whereas mine are a little more contemporary. But there are a lot of commonalities: we love Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. And then there are newer songwriters like Ryan Adams and Jason Isbell,\u201d said Lesyk. As the frontwoman for the band, Pryne is the focal point and centre of attention for the band for both her force-of-nature stage presence and her amazingly dynamic and unmistakably authentic whisky-soaked voice. \u201cI played in a blues band when I was a kid. That definitely shaped the sound of my voice. Even though I don\u2019t listen to blues records all the time there is just something about it that I gravitate to \u2013 it was natural for me,\u201d Pryne said. \u201cAnd oddly enough I didn\u2019t really dig into a lot of female artists until I was in my mid-20s. Until then, Robert Plant was more of an influence on me. When I started to discover women in music it was Tina Turner initially. And Bonnie Raitt is huge. I just love the tenderness in her voice, which she can also turn into a real raspy growl.\u201d The Mandevilles is the latest incarnation of Pryne and Lesyk\u2019s musical merger, which began around the turn of the millennium in the Niagara Region of southern Ontario. After playing in cover bands separately and then together, the duo started penning their own material and formed the hard rock outfit Oliver Black. Soon thereafter they were courted by an American record label that soon went bankrupt, leaving the band at loose ends, and living in the United States. After moving to Europe for a short time, the band released an album under the name Serena Pryne and The Mandevilles which saw them begin an ongoing songwriting collaboration with Nashville-based Niagara Falls transplant Dave \u201cDwave\u201d Thomson. But with a revolving door of musicians and a yearning for something fresh, Lesyk and Pryne decided to return to Canada and reboot the band. Only guitarist Taylor Laslo was kept, and long-time friend Brett Bendo was brought in to play drums a couple of month before the band was set to fly to Vancouver to work at Richardson\u2019s The Farm Studios. After auditioning a number of prospective bassists, Waylon Glintz blew his future bandmates away and got the gig \u2013 three weeks before recording was to begin. Alongside Don\u2019t Ask, Windows and Stones features infectious, melodic rock tunes like the lead-off track, Hangovers, which as evidenced by the name, encapsulates the unpleasant result of an evening of overindulging. \u201cWe visit our friend Dave (Thomson) a couple of times a year in Nashville. During one visit he had a massive blow up with his then fianc\u00e9. But then they reconciled and we decided to have a party to celebrate. We bought several litres of rum and drank it all in one night. I think we almost killed him! The next day he didn\u2019t wake up until well into the evening and he looked like death. When he woke up we wrote the song in about 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d said Lesyk with a hearty laugh. A more blues-rock fueled version of the traditional country break-up song is I Stole Your Band. \u201cI was working as a seamstress and I was bored one day and kept singing this line \u2018I stole your band when you broke my heart. It was just one of those funny little anecdotes where I\u2019m saying to a fictional boyfriend \u2018if you do something stupid, I\u2019m going to steal your f***ing band,\u201d said Pryne. While The One was another defining moment for the Mandevilles as it was a song that truly brought all five members into the creative process. \u201cWhen we were in pre-production we had a magical moment which I never would have expected. It was in a completely different style when we first brought it to GGGarth, just a happy little folk song. He said it was good but didn\u2019t really go anywhere,\u201d Pryne explained. \u201cWe said let\u2019s take five minutes and work on it a bit. All of a sudden we just started playing and all five of us together created this whole new song. It was one of those inexplicable crazy moments. It\u2019s kind of a heavy song about death, but ambiguous as to what has died \u2013 a person, an idea, a dream a relationship \u2013 it means different things to different people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all us on this record. There are very few tricks, no Auto-tuning of the vocals, and we\u2019re all playing real instruments on every track,\u201d said Pryne. With this remarkable, well-crafted album that manages to be tight in its musicianship but loose in its vibe, The Mandevilles have taken one giant, definitive leap for rock and roll.

This too is emblematic of The Mandevilles\u2019 \u2018leave it all on the floor\u2019 approach to writing, recording and especially performing the music live. And it\u2019s music that couldn\u2019t be more straightforward and unpretentious in its approach and delivery. No studio trickery, experimental flights of fancy or self-indulgence - just rock and roll. \u201cBeing a Canadian, I think it\u2019s funny that I describe it as American rock and roll. I say that because it\u2019s reminiscent of Tom Petty, John Mellencamp, Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen - all rolled into one. Our music comes from the same place.\u201d said Lesyk. Pryne and Lesyk are the creative nucleus of The Mandevilles and have been musical partners for nearly 15 years, although both bring significantly different musical influences to the table. \u201cSerena\u2019s influences are steeped more in the roots of rock and roll whereas mine are a little more contemporary. But there are a lot of commonalities: we love Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. And then there are newer songwriters like Ryan Adams and Jason Isbell,\u201d said Lesyk. As the frontwoman for the band, Pryne is the focal point and centre of attention for the band for both her force-of-nature stage presence and her amazingly dynamic and unmistakably authentic whisky-soaked voice. \u201cI played in a blues band when I was a kid. That definitely shaped the sound of my voice. Even though I don\u2019t listen to blues records all the time there is just something about it that I gravitate to \u2013 it was natural for me,\u201d Pryne said. \u201cAnd oddly enough I didn\u2019t really dig into a lot of female artists until I was in my mid-20s. Until then, Robert Plant was more of an influence on me. When I started to discover women in music it was Tina Turner initially. And Bonnie Raitt is huge. I just love the tenderness in her voice, which she can also turn into a real raspy growl.\u201d The Mandevilles is the latest incarnation of Pryne and Lesyk\u2019s musical merger, which began around the turn of the millennium in the Niagara Region of southern Ontario. After playing in cover bands separately and then together, the duo started penning their own material and formed the hard rock outfit Oliver Black. Soon thereafter they were courted by an American record label that soon went bankrupt, leaving the band at loose ends, and living in the United States. After moving to Europe for a short time, the band released an album under the name Serena Pryne and The Mandevilles which saw them begin an ongoing songwriting collaboration with Nashville-based Niagara Falls transplant Dave \u201cDwave\u201d Thomson. But with a revolving door of musicians and a yearning for something fresh, Lesyk and Pryne decided to return to Canada and reboot the band. Only guitarist Taylor Laslo was kept, and long-time friend Brett Bendo was brought in to play drums a couple of month before the band was set to fly to Vancouver to work at Richardson\u2019s The Farm Studios. After auditioning a number of prospective bassists, Waylon Glintz blew his future bandmates away and got the gig \u2013 three weeks before recording was to begin. Alongside Don\u2019t Ask, Windows and Stones features infectious, melodic rock tunes like the lead-off track, Hangovers, which as evidenced by the name, encapsulates the unpleasant result of an evening of overindulging. \u201cWe visit our friend Dave (Thomson) a couple of times a year in Nashville. During one visit he had a massive blow up with his then fianc\u00e9. But then they reconciled and we decided to have a party to celebrate. We bought several litres of rum and drank it all in one night. I think we almost killed him! The next day he didn\u2019t wake up until well into the evening and he looked like death. When he woke up we wrote the song in about 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d said Lesyk with a hearty laugh. A more blues-rock fueled version of the traditional country break-up song is I Stole Your Band. \u201cI was working as a seamstress and I was bored one day and kept singing this line \u2018I stole your band when you broke my heart. It was just one of those funny little anecdotes where I\u2019m saying to a fictional boyfriend \u2018if you do something stupid, I\u2019m going to steal your f***ing band,\u201d said Pryne. While The One was another defining moment for the Mandevilles as it was a song that truly brought all five members into the creative process. \u201cWhen we were in pre-production we had a magical moment which I never would have expected. It was in a completely different style when we first brought it to GGGarth, just a happy little folk song. He said it was good but didn\u2019t really go anywhere,\u201d Pryne explained. \u201cWe said let\u2019s take five minutes and work on it a bit. All of a sudden we just started playing and all five of us together created this whole new song. It was one of those inexplicable crazy moments. It\u2019s kind of a heavy song about death, but ambiguous as to what has died \u2013 a person, an idea, a dream a relationship \u2013 it means different things to different people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all us on this record. There are very few tricks, no Auto-tuning of the vocals, and we\u2019re all playing real instruments on every track,\u201d said Pryne. With this remarkable, well-crafted album that manages to be tight in its musicianship but loose in its vibe, The Mandevilles have taken one giant, definitive leap for rock and roll.

Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture.

Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau.

Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cFRIDAY NIGHT HYPE\u201d EVERY FRIDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney.

The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown!

The dynamic pair are recording/performing artists, songwriters, musicians, audio engineers and producers.\n\nTheir first single, (an out-and-proud Trip Hop style song titled \"#Queen\") has achieved over 50k streams on Spotify and over 25k views on the official music video via YouTube since it's release on October 5th, 2018. Their follow up single (a soft, House track titled \"Can Be Beautiful\") was released on December 21st, 2018, and has since been featured on Billboard Sound and AXS.\n\nStarting a YouTube channel in August of 2013 and making their debut as Elvis Presley's daughter (Lisa Marie Presley)'s supporting act that same year, together they have since begun to take the music world by storm.\n\nThe duo boast a long list of live touring accomplishments and come equipped with a catalog of over 200 original songs. Their outstanding, solid fan base is made up of an array of live audiences, the YouTube community, and social media; where their popularity is ever increasing. Posting covers of both popular and original songs, live performances, v-logs, and behind-the-scenes videos weekly, their YouTube channel has recently reached an impressive tally of over 3 quarter million views overall.\n\nThe sibling duo regularly perform and tour nationally and have frequented venues such as LA's El Rey Theatre, San Juan Capistrano's The Coach House, and (just recently) have played the House of Blues in Anaheim (twice just in 2018), Bar 20 at the Grafton Hotel in Beverly Hills, the Simi Valley fireworks celebration (with over 20,000 people in attendance), at the Gibson theater in Beverly Hills, at Pickwick's Pub in Woodland Hills, a headlining show at Monterey Court in Tucson, AZ, and much more. Nicole & Scotty are currently booking for 2019, and inquiries can be emailed to ulomag28@sbcglobal.net.\n\nThey continuously entertain radio and television appearances; a few of which have included Los Angeles' Hot 103.9 Move to the Music, KHTS 98.1 FM, New York station Gold Star Radio, Las Vegas' 702 ROX, and the TV Entertainment segment Michelle's Corner. Their music is played regularly on a rapidly growing list of stations world wide, proving that the duo are not only rapidly garnering global recognition, but are also vastly appreciated and loved by their fans from all over the world.\n\nThe siblings also dabble in acting; with Scotty having co-starred in an episode of HBO's popular comedy series \"Vice Principals\", which aired October 8th, 2017.\n\nNicole & Scotty have also been featured in several major entertainment publications; including the international music trade magazine, \"Music Connection\" and the entertainment review, \"What's REALLY Going ON\", (where Nicole occasionally writes her own column and where the sister/brother duo were featured front cover in April of 2015).\n\nFrom playing shows with touring musicians who've accompanied major bands and artists (such as The Four Seasons, Barry Manilow,or John Mayer), to garnering attention from well respected industry folks, (such as producer Teddy Riley), making connections and long lasting relationships in the industry are extremely important to Nicole & Scotty.\n\nPerforming for charities and worthy causes they strongly stand for is also a passion of theirs; the siblings having played shows to raise breast cancer awareness, raise funds for youth programs, and entertain schools in the past.\n\nWhen asked, the siblings cite their brand of Pop music as \"current, energetic and brutally honest\". Their sound is indeed uniquely sincere in a genre where it is crucial to uphold the integrity of new and innovative music. The duo delivers just that by stringing raw, personal lyrics through hypnotic hooks and synth layered foundations, accompanied by thrumming bass lines and drum patterns emulating the heartbeat of their own sound. Combining an assortment of authentic Pop arrangements and Trap influence with Electronic Dance beats and rhythms, the duo offer up a wide variety of innovative and well crafted songs that translate deep rooted emotions of every nature to their listeners. As if their artistic thumbprints aren't already present enough in their recordings, a melodic acoustic and the duo's signature ambient electric guitar can be heard flitting in and out of the tunes the pair proudly create and stand by.\n\nNicole, (21), and Scotty, (17), are two young and immensely talented musicians intent on continuing a journey full of song, and wish to share the melodies in their hearts with the world.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mr.Lambo LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8889162.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Edm, Bass", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born in Chicago, Minnesota raised, and California taught.

With his vocal range of seven plus octaves, ability to swing from a deep guttural baritone to soaring soprano riffs, knack for capturing life through lyrics, and commanding stage presence, he has carved a niche for himself in today\u2019s music world. A prolific songwriter, he has a large and varied catalog of songs ranging from heart-wrenching acoustic ballads to heart-pounding heavier rock. His music is published by EMI Music Publishing Canada (2004-present). Lukas first ventured onto the music scene with two Canadian bands, Cleavage (1995-2005) and Rise Electric (2005-2006), which helped prepare him for what was to come. He entered and won the competition television show Rock Star: Supernova (2006) which earned him front man status with Tommy Lee (Motley Crue), Jason Newsted (Metallica), and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). Their band Rock Star Supernova completed an album and a world tour of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Following the tour, Lukas returned to Los Angeles and began writing and recording new music. The Love and Lust EP (June 2007) was released and he completed the solo acoustic Love and Lust Tour, making over two dozen stops throughout the United States and Canada. The new material was well-received by fans, and the band Stars Down was born (2008-present). After touring with his new band, Lukas began playing local gigs at such southern California hot spots as The Roxy, The Key Club, The Mint, and Viper Room. The year 2010 kicked off with a mini East Coast tour and Lukas working on his first full length album. Hollywood was released (July 2010) and debuted live at West Hollywood\u2019s famous Viper Room. The all acoustic Hollywood Stripped followed (August 2010). After moving to Nashville, in addition to local and out-of-town gigs, he wrote, recorded, produced, and released six additional recordings. The first three were Seed EP (December 2010), Story Teller (January 2011), and Super, Sex, Magic (February 2011). He also co-wrote, provided vocals, and recorded several music videos for a side-project, Switchblade Glory (April 2011). Lukas released Prophecy (November 2011) and Christmas Collection (December 2011) to complete a very busy year. But he wasn\u2019t finished, releasing the album 8 Days (April 2012) soon after. Lukas has appeared on many media outlets, including performing live at the 2006 Gemini awards, the CBS television series Rock Star: Supernova (18 million viewers worldwide), Ellen, Regis & Kelly, The Jimmy Kimmel Show, Entertainment Tonight, The Howard Stern Show, and ET Canada. In addition to his vocal talent, Lukas plays multiple instruments, is a songwriter, producer, actor, and vocal instructor. He currently resides with his wife Kendra in Nashville, Tennessee.

The blistering guitarist, soulful vocalist, singular songwriter and city bus driver fuses his muscular, rock-inspired blues guitar playing with his original, keenly detailed slice-of-life songs, blazing his own blues trail. With the 2016 release of his Alligator Records debut, The Chicago Way, Cannon burst onto the international stage as one the most electrifying bluesmen to emerge from Chicago in decades. His live performances unfailingly earn him heaps of critical praise and hordes of wildly enthusiastic fans. Cannon has played major cities all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe. He recently performed for the first time in Japan, delighting and surprising audiences with one unforgettable gig after another. Now, with the release of The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Cannon builds upon the foundation he\u2019s laid, creating and defining his vision of contemporary blues.\n\nThe Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp features twelve Cannon originals, ranging from the burning social commentary of the title track to the wryly told, up-to-the-minute truths of Insurance to the trademark Cannon humor of Stop Me When I\u2019m Lying and Ordinary Woman. He gets serious on the haunting The First 24, the Martin Luther King-inspired The Silence Of My Friends and on the moving final track, I\u2019m Not Scared. Cannon\u2019s blazing guitar and soul-baring vocals are front and center. His songwriting is inspired by his deep Chicago roots, the wisdom of his grandparents and his years of observing the public while driving a bus. His songs tell timeless stories of common experiences in uncommon ways.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the solos,\u201d Cannon says, \u201cIt\u2019s about the songs. People get used to everyday life, so it\u2019s easy to miss the things around them. I write about those things. I know the problems of Chicago, the hardship, 'cause we\u2019re always a scapegoat. But I choose to love and respect the city because of the Chicago blues giants that came here from down south. I\u2019m proud to be standing on the shoulders of every great Chicago blues musician who came before me.\u201d\n\nToronzo Cannon was born in the Windy City on February 14, 1968, and grew up in the shadows of the notoriously tough Robert Taylor Homes. Theresa\u2019s Lounge, one of the city\u2019s most famous South Side blues clubs, was nearby. As a child, Cannon would stand on the sidewalk outside the door, soaking up the live blues pouring out while trying to sneak a glance inside at larger-than-life bluesmen like Junior Wells and Buddy Guy. He also heard plenty of blues growing up in his grandfather\u2019s home, and listened to soul, R&B and contemporary rock on the radio.\n\nCannon bought his first guitar at age 22, and his natural talent enabled him to quickly master the instrument. Although his initial focus was reggae, he found himself increasingly drawn to the blues. \u201cIt was dormant in me. But when I started playing the blues, I found my voice and the blues came pouring out.\u201d He absorbed sounds, styles and licks from Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Hound Dog Taylor, B.B. King, Albert King, Freddie King, Jimi Hendrix, J.B. Hutto, Lil\u2019 Ed and others. Although influenced by many, Cannon\u2019s biting, stinging guitar sound is all his own.\n\nCannon began his rise in the intensely competitive proving ground of the local club scene, where only the best musicians reach the top. Iconic blues artists from Muddy Waters to Howlin\u2019 Wolf to Koko Taylor to Hound Dog Taylor to Luther Allison all paid their dues in the Chicago blues bars before making their mark on the world. The same holds true today, as newcomers look to living legends like Buddy Guy, Jimmy Johnson and Lil\u2019 Ed Williams for inspiration in taking their music from Chicago to fans across the globe.\n\nFrom 1996 through 2002, Cannon played as a sideman for Tommy McCracken, Wayne Baker Brooks, L.V. Banks and Joanna Connor. But he was determined to prove himself. In 2001, while continuing to work as a hired-gun guitarist, he formed his own band, The Cannonball Express. By 2003, he was working exclusively as a band leader. Cannon\u2019s first three albums\u20142007\u2019s My Woman (self-released), 2011\u2019s Leaving Mood (Delmark) and 2013\u2019s Blues Music Award-nominated John The Conqueror Root (Delmark)\u2014document his rise from promising up-and-comer to star-in-the-making.\n\nAlmost immediately upon the release of The Chicago Way, Chicago media helped launch Cannon toward blues stardom. He was the subject of multiple newspaper and magazine feature stories and appeared on every local television station. National and international media soon took notice. CNN filmed Cannon leading a tour of Chicago blues clubs and then broadcast the piece around the world. England\u2019s MOJO magazine declared The Chicago Way the #1 Blues Album Of 2016, as did the readers of Living Blues magazine in their annual poll. The album and Cannon were also nominated for four Blues Music Awards (the Grammy of the blues) in 2017. And the world champion Chicago Cubs invited Cannon to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the September 13, 2017 game. All the attention only makes Cannon more focused. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become an ambassador for Chicago blues. People expect a lot from me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s good, because I\u2019m forced to keep upping my game.\u201d\n\nCannon has played the Chicago Blues Festival on ten separate occasions, initially as a sideman, then as a special guest, a sidestage band leader and finally as a main stage headliner. When he\u2019s home, he drives a Chicago Transit Authority bus by day and performs by night. Using every vacation day and day off and working four ten-hour shifts a week, Cannon arranges his schedule to gig out of town as much as possible. It isn\u2019t easy, but, like all of the Chicago greats who have come before him, blues is his calling. Blues Music Magazine declares, \u201cHis guitar playing has all the fire and spontaneity of the Chicago legends he carries; his songwriting is a timely and original look at the world he sees by day on a bus and in blues clubs by night, and his assertive voice is the perfect vehicle to deliver the message.\u201d\n\nNow, with The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Toronzo Cannon delivers his messages loud and clear. Between his searing chops, soul-satisfying vocals and vibrant and distinctive original songs, Cannon has grown from being a local attraction to become a world-renowned torch bearer for the blues. PBS Television\u2019s Chicago Tonight sums it up like this: \u201cCannon is just your typical CTA bus driver who moonlights as a sought-after Chicago blues musician. As a guitarist, singer and songwriter, he drives the sound of Chicago blues from the city to blues clubs and festivals around the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CantStopTheBlues"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Roots Of Creation ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8970575.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Contact: rootsofcreation@Gmail.com", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Billboard and radio chart topping, award-winning, international reggae-rock sensation Roots of Creation, are a touring powerhouse.\n\nWhether on the festival circuit, performing at jam and reggae-rock favorites like Camp Bisco, Gathering of The Vibes, California Roots, Jungle Jam and Closer to the Sun, or sharing the stage at sold out shows with some of their diverse influences including Slightly Stoopid, The Wailers, and Michael Franti, reggae/rock/dubtronica band Roots of Creation (RoC) offers up a high-energy, infectious live music experience.

Following releases on Clone and Ultramajic, Dance System took a five-year hiatus and is excited to return with the Wind 'Em Up EP, released on April 12th on Modeselektor\u2019s lauded Monkeytown Records.\n\nIn today\u2019s serious techno world, and against the current political landscape, Dance System is the playful breath of fresh air we all want and need. With influence from Dance Mania and Relief Records, Dance System takes a nod from Chicago, but makes a new sound distinctly his own.\n\nIndeed, on title track Wind Em Up, Dance System is playfully calling out for other DJs to do exactly that; wind up the crowd with the unexpected UK garage breaks that bring colour to the driving beat and guitar lick. Heeez Baaad takes a single hypnotic loop and pushes it to its absolute limit, the only break coming when the track slows down to a halt, before slamming straight back into the action. Bringing in the horns on That That Sh**, the off\u2013kilter horn loop is unsettling, but driven along by the low end tom groove.

With the prolific duo\u2019s meteoric rise a true testament to their hard work in the studio and infectious energy in the club, a slew of early releases via imprints such as Viva, and elrow helped rocket the pair to their first Beatport Number #1 with their breakthrough record on Hot Creations, \u2018Tribesmen\u2019.\n\nHaving later released EPs on Toolroom Records, Lee Foss\u2019 Repopulate Mars and Green Velvet\u2019s Relief Records, Solardo soon branched out into their now iconic Sola imprint - which soon became a home for a flurry of the most predominant tech-house tracks on the circuit. With over 50 releases on the label with tracks from the likes of Max Chapman, Mason Maynard, and Grammy nominated duo CamelPhat - who Mark & James worked with on collaborative club track \u2018Accelerator\u2019, the label has gone from strength to strength hosting parties at the BPM Festival, The Warehouse Project and its own club showcase at The Source in Maidstone.\n\nAfter being assigned remixes for the likes of MK, David Guetta, Black Coffee, Nicole Moudaber & Carl Cox, Solardo\u2019s success hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed and they signed to Ultra Music. Since then, the pair have gone onto release hits \u2018Be Somebody\u2019, \u2018Tango Wango\u2019 and their latest release \u2018XTC\u2019. Arguably the duo\u2019s most successful release to date, the track has been an anthem for them and many DJ\u2019s alike with it being hailed as one of the tracks of the summer in Ibiza. So much so, BBC Radio 1 used it to promote all of their big weekend in Ibiza adverts - where Mark & James also played - whilst it was championed by Annie Mac (Hottest Record In The World), Pete Tong, Danny Howard (Friday Fire) & MistaJam (#1 Radio 1 dance charts) across the station. The tracks' success didn\u2019t end there, with it being voted thewinner of \u2018best track of the year\u2019 at the DJ Mag Best of British awards.\n\nThe love didn\u2019t stop there for the lads, towards the end of 2019 they hooked up with legendary producer Marshall Jefferson to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of one of the most iconic house tunes \u2018Move Your Body\u2019. With the lads touch, the track has been reborn into a modern day anthem only proven by it dominating the Beatport charts (the release was No.1 for 46 days which is an all time record!), being added to BBC Radio 1\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 list for three weeks straight and Scott Mills & BBC Radio 1 themselves selecting it for \u2018Tune Of The Weekend\u2019. With support coming from all corners of the globe, the release peaked at #1 in Sweden, #5 in the UK and #27 worldwide in the Spotify viral charts, and was in the top 100 Shazam\u2019s in 5 countries, peaking at #7 in the UK.\n\nMusic aside, the duo\u2019s presence on the road is ever growing. After selling out The Warehouse Project and London\u2019s Studio 338 with their brand new event series HIGHER, the pair took HIGHER on the road with successful stage takeovers at the likes of Higher Vision in Ireland and Mysteryland in Holland, where Eric Morillo, Skream & Groove Armada came and played. Mark & James also found the time to fit in over 30 major festivals throughout the course of 2019 including sets at Glastonbury, Creamfields, Parklife, Holyship, Babylon Festival, Tomorrowland (x2), EDC Las Vegas, We Are FSTVL, Beyond Wonderland, Snowbombing and their first Ultra Music Festival in Miami where they launched collaborative project SoPhat alongside Camelphat.\n\nFollowing on from their Club Solardo residency in the club room at Hi Ibiza last year, the duo launched their brand new record breaking 12 week residency BODYWORKS (again at Hi Ibiza) with themselves and Camelphat hosting the theatre, and FISHER in the club room. During the course of the summer, BODYWORKS broke numerous club records with over 7000+ people through the doors on multiple occasions and an estimated 90,000 passing through over the 12 weeks. With guests including Enzo Siragusa, Heidi, Danny Howard, Mason Maynard and many more, it just goes to show what a force theyhave now become on the island.\n\nThe duo\u2019s own radio show named \u2018The Spot\u2019 continues to go from strength to strength. Fast approaching it\u2019s 100th episode, they have so far had guests such as Claude VonStroke, Nicole Moudaber, Andrea Oliva, Gorgon City, MK, Skream and Kenny Dope all contributing guest mixes for the pair.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade.

After leaving school, he bought a Transit van and set up his own sound system.\n\nIn 1979, Pete became a journalist for monthly magazine Blues & Soul. By the following year, he was features editor, a position he would hold until '83. At the same time, he was appearing on local radio stations such as BBC Radio Medway and London. Then he got his first break with Radio 1, presenting a regular 15 minute 'magazine' feature on dance music on Peter Powell's show. \"That was a strange experience, but also very exciting,\" says Pete. \"Radio 1 was at the peak of its popularity. I had to say what was happening on the streets. I was the first person to play Malcolm McLaren's Buffalo Gals on the radio.\"\n\nPete's knowledge of the dance underground, coupled with his ear for a crossover hit, saw him appointed A&R manager at newly-founded independent label London Records in '83. While looking after the careers of pop acts like '80s girl group Bananarama, he continued to pursue his budding radio career. Put off daytime shows by the discovery that the DJs didn't pick their own playlists, Pete accepted his own programme on Kent's newly-launched Invicta station in '84. Influenced by radio DJ heroes such as Robbie Vincent, Greg Edwards and Emperor Rosko, he hosted a soul show there for three years, before briefly returning to Radio London. Almost immediately, however, he was poached by Capital Radio, where his weekly dance programme became cult listening with London clubbers.\n\nIn '88, in the wake of Acid House, Pete launched his own record label, FFRR, through London Records. His aim was to both embrace the new wave of electronic music flooding into the country from cities such as Detroit and Chicago, and continue to promote his first love, black dance artists. \"The first record I put out was a very cool, quite sexually-explicit single from Chicago called Baby Wants To Ride,\" he recalls. \"I had a rule which was to sign one relatively-indulgent record to every potential big hit. I was aware from the start that you can be hip, but you also have to balance the books.\"\n\nInevitably, Pete managed to do both, simultaneously. FFRR's next releases were cut'n'paste production 'Bass (How Low Can You Go?)' by Simon Harris and Salt'n'Pepa's 'Push It', both cool club tracks which went on to storm the charts. They were followed by a stream of influential hits from signings such as Steve 'Silk' Hurley, D Mob, Smith & Mighty, Cookie Crew, L'il Louis The Brand New Heavies, Orbital and, of course, Goldie.\n\nIn '91, with an indigenous club culture now thriving in cities across the UK, Pete quit Capital Radio to go national. His Essential Selection show every Friday evening instantly established itself as a welcome to the weekend for a new generation of young clubbers. Heavy on house, but with room for the best breaking techno, jungle, hip hop, funk and soul sounds from both Britain and around the world, it appealed to all tastes in contemporary dance music. Moreover, it merged the cutting-edge with the mainstream. Pete became the country's best-known dance DJ, while keeping his credibility intact. \"I'm not too concerned with credibility,\" he claims. \"When I started out, I was obsessed by jazz-funk and soul. I couldn't see life beyond the end of a Donald Byrd album. I was prepared to punch anyone who tried to talk to me about other types of music. But I grew up and discovered that I love hearing new sounds and having my perceptions changed. I didn't want to be pigeon-holed. I also realised that I could achieve much more by staying on the edge of several scenes, rather than being immersed in just the one.\"\n\nPerhaps Pete's biggest contribution to British pop to date was his involvement in the reshaping of BBC Radio 1. When the nation's biggest radio station decided to re-invent itself in the mid-'90s, controller Matthew Bannister knew precisely who to ask for help. After Pete's ideas were taken on board, the likes of Tim Westwood, Danny Rampling, Judge Jules, Carl Cox and, more recently, Fabio and Grooverider, started to appear on Radio 1's DJ roster. In addition, the station's daytime playlist began to reflect the extent of the impact of modern electronic music on British kids. In January '99, Pete enters his eighth year as the presenter of Essential Selection. With over a million and a half listeners each week, it remains the UK's most popular dance music radio show, thanks to its host's consistent ability to change with the times. Its success has also spawned a series of compilation albums, released by FFRR, which to date have sold over 750,000 copies. The latest - which boasts a tangerine-themed cover and the mixing talents of Tong, Paul Oakenfold and, if you're lucky enough to bag a limited edition copy with a bonus CD, Carl Cox - comes complete with Madonna's seal of approval. It is the first time ever that the singer has sanctioned the appearance of one of her songs (Drowned World) on a dance mix compilation.\n\nDuring '98, Pete made his first forays into television, an area he is keen to explore. In November, he donned different guises to present Clublife, a 90-minute, BBC-broadcast documentary based on Mixmag magazine's annual dance awards. However, when he does appear with his own TV programme, it won't be for want of publicity. In the past, he has turned down offers to present Radio 1's high-profile breakfast and Top 40 shows, not to mention Top Of The Pops.\n\nIn the meantime, Pete has plenty on his plate. He is a director of Wise Buddah, the production company which makes radio programmes presented by Danny Rampling, Seb Fontiane and Judge Jules and continues to work in A&R for London Records. His pop star credentials include A&R-ing Shakespeare Sister's hit Stay, which topped the charts for six weeks in '92, and played a big role in signing All Saints, whose career he continues to oversee. He was recently musical director on films, Human Traffic and The Beach.\n\nThe year 2000 proved to be a milestone for Pete - he toured the US for the first time which saw queues around the block, he played on the terrace at Space in Ibiza for the first time, he played in Cape Town and Johannesburg and hosted his own float at Radio 1's 'Love Parade' - \"standing on my float with Jon Carter and Darren Emerson in front of 250,000 Radio 1 listeners was just the best feeling ever - a real moment in history\".\n\n2001 is proving to be an equally exciting year for Pete with another tour of the States starting in March and his first tour of South America scheduled for later in the year.\n\nKeeping his feet on the ground in the UK, Pete continues to be a valuable part of the British club scene with regular gigs scheduled at Tribal Sessions at Sankey Soap in Manchester, Code in Birmingham and many other credible commitments. He still remains a key figure at the UK summer festivals including for the first time a performance at T-In The Park as well as his yearly appointment at Creamfields and Homelands (Foot and mouth permitting).\n\nPete's Radio 1 show \"The Essential Selection\" is now the most listened to radio show on the internet attracting a global audience of over 12 million.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Leftwing & Kody ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8472328.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "House, Deep House, Techno, Electronic", "Time": "12:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Given the impact they have had, it\u2019s hard to believe Leftwing & Kody only launched in 2012.

First TV performance at age 6 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Alceo Bocchino with a Haydn concerto, and another two times the same concerto conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho and Isaac Karabtchevsky with the Orquestra Sinfonica Brasileira. At age 7 she performed Mozart KV488 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Edouard van Remoortel (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nIn the USA she received the \"special prize\" of the jury at the Van Cliburn competition, and she made an indelible impression with Beethoven\u00b4s piano concerto n.4 at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.\n\nAfter the \"wonderkind\" and \"competitions\" happenings, she received invitations to perform in more than 25 countries. Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos.

Peddling a kind of jangly guitar pop not dissimilar to their Scottish contemporaries Aztec Camera and Orange Juice, they had three hit singles in the UK, all written by guitarist and founder member Bobby Bluebell (aka Robert Hodgens) - \"I'm Falling\" with Ken McCluskey , \"Cath\", and their biggest success \"Young At Heart\". The latter was co-written with Siobhan Fahey (with whom Hodgens was romantically linked for a while) and made it to No.8 in the UK singles chart on its original release in 1984. The band also released two albums, \"The Bluebells\" and \"Sisters\".\n\nThe band split up in the mid-1980s, but enjoyed an unexpected - albeit brief - revival in 1993 when \"Young At Heart\" was used in a Volkswagen TV commercial. Re-issued as a single, it was No.1 for four weeks and led to the band reforming temporarily to perform the song on Top of the Pops. A singles collection followed.\n\nAt the time of the 1990s revival, band member Lawrence Donegan - who trained as a journalist after the band's demise and is now golfing correspondent for The Guardian - wrote a newspaper article reminiscing about his days as a Bluebell which caused some friction between himself and the rest of the band. Amongst other anecdotes, he claimed that the group took part in a talent contest in Los Angeles in 1984, where a fellow contestant - an up-and-coming singer called Madonna - blew cigarette smoke into the band's faces and declared them to be \"losers\". The other ex-Bluebells are adamant that no such incident took place. Donegan has also published 'California Dreaming', a book based on his experiences selling used cars in Los Angeles.\n\nThe other members of the band stayed in the music business after the split. David McCluskey and his brother, Ken, formed a folk duo (www.myspace.com/mccluskeybrothers) . Robert Hodgens formed Up.

They were formed in Clydebank, Scotland in 1982. They took their name from the Scritti Politti song, \"Gettin, havin' and holdin'\".\n\nIn 1994 Wet Wet Wet had their biggest hit, with a cover version of the The Troggs single \"Love Is All Around\", which was a huge international success and spent 15 weeks at Number 1 in the British charts. Only Marti Pellow's insistence on deletion (he was bored of its chart domination, and overheard people complaining about it) prevented the song from possibly equalling and breaking, the record for the longest-standing Number 1 single, held by Bryan Adams.\nThe song was used on the soundtrack to the film Four Weddings and a Funeral. In the official UK best-selling singles list issued in 2002, it was placed 11th.\n\nDuring the rest of the 1990s the band maintained a strong UK following, although success in the singles charts became more sporadic. Pellow quit the band and went into rehab to battle a debilitating heroin addiction, while Tommy Cunningham resigned acrimoniously.\nPellow succeeded in kicking his habit, and returned to the public eye in 2001, with a solo album. In 2003, the Pellow and Cunnigham cautiously reformed with Graeme Clark and Neil Mitchell in order to work on a new record, and a single called \"All I Want\" which was released in October 2004.\n\nWet Wet Wet reunited in 2004 for a successful tour in the UK, and released a Greatest Hits album.\n\nIn 2005 Wet Wet Wet played at the Summer Weekender in England, and were one of the headline acts at Live 8 Edinburgh.\n\nWet Wet Wet's latest album Timeless was released in 2007.\n\nFor photographs and additional information visit Wet Wet Wet's official website, www.WetWetWet.co.uk .", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Harri ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cairn String Quartet ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7382358.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Contempory, Classical", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Cairn String Quartet is an experience like no other \u2013 four of the UK's elite string players coming together to create a unique and inspirational orchestral show with a twist.

Y es a ra\u00edz de ello cuando, en noviembre de 2005, estos tres m\u00fasicos fueron invitados, junto a un cuarto cuatrista, Rafael Mart\u00ednez, a participar en un concierto organizado por la Fundaci\u00f3n Multifon\u00eda. All\u00ed, cada uno har\u00eda una muestra de su trabajo como solista, pero espont\u00e1neamente estos m\u00fasicos decidieron hacer d\u00faos, tr\u00edos y un cierre final a cuarteto. Este momento marc\u00f3 la g\u00e9nesis de este ensamble que tiene como figura predominante el cuatro venezolano. De diferentes ciudades de Venezuela, Jorge Glem de Cuman\u00e1, H\u00e9ctor Molina de M\u00e9rida y Edward Ram\u00edrez de Caracas, convergieron en la capital venezolana para dar forma a una de las propuestas musicales m\u00e1s importantes de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. En el a\u00f1o 2006, la agrupaci\u00f3n asume definitivamente el nombre de C4 Tr\u00edo, gracias a la grabaci\u00f3n de su primera producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica que estuvo bajo la producci\u00f3n musical de Aquiles B\u00e1ez y que cont\u00f3 con la participaci\u00f3n de un nutrido grupo de m\u00fasicos venezolanos, como Serenata Guayanesa, Rafael \"el Pollo\" Brito, Marina Bravo, Zeneida Rodr\u00edguez, Adolfo Herrera, Roberto Koch, Edwin Arellano y el propio Aquiles B\u00e1ez. R\u00e1pidamente, el disco compacto se convirti\u00f3 en una referencia de la m\u00fasica en Venezuela y en poco tiempo pas\u00f3 a ser doble Disco de Oro por el n\u00famero de copias vendidas. Esta producci\u00f3n dispar\u00f3 la popularidad de C4 Tr\u00edo, permiti\u00e9ndoles tener una intensa actividad en las m\u00e1s prestigiosas salas de Venezuela y una fuerte agenda internacional que los ha llevado, en dos ediciones \u20132005 y 2006\u2013, al Festival Venezuelan Sounds, organizado por la Embajada de Venezuela en Estados Unidos, que incluy\u00f3 conciertos en el Bol\u00edvar Hall de Washington, Smithsonian Institution Building, The Castle y Kennedy Center; en 2007, a Inglaterra al Salisbury Intertantional Art Festival 2007 y Bol\u00edvar Hall de Londres; en 2008, al Sal\u00f3n Azul de la Intendencia de Montevideo-Uruguay y al Mercado Cultural de Bah\u00eda 2008, en Brasil. As\u00ed mismo, ha compartido escena con un nutrido n\u00famero de artistas nacionales e internacionales, entre los que cabe destacar a Jorge Drexler, Soledad Bravo, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Rafael \u201cel Pollo\u201d Brito, El Cuarteto, Edmar Casta\u00f1eda, Eddy Marcano, Juan Tom\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez, Aquiles B\u00e1ez, Alexis C\u00e1rdenas, Cheo Hurtado, Gonzalo Teppa, entre otros. En 2009, C4 lanza al mercado su segunda producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica, Entre manos, que viene acompa\u00f1ada, adem\u00e1s, de un DVD donde el grupo muestra su desempe\u00f1o en un concierto en vivo. Entre manos muestra una faceta mucho m\u00e1s madura de la agrupaci\u00f3n, incluye composiciones de sus integrantes y las participaciones como invitados de Alexis C\u00e1rdenas, Yonathan Gavidia, Jorge Torres, Jos\u00e9 Alejandro Delgado y Rodner Padilla quien, desde este mismo a\u00f1o, comienza a formar parte definitiva de C4 como bajista, lo que ha enriquecido a\u00fan m\u00e1s la propuesta musical de la agrupaci\u00f3n, caracterizada por abordar un repertorio no tan com\u00fan para el cuatro, con el que se explota un sinf\u00edn de recursos sonoros, agregando a sus interpretaciones un porcentaje importante de improvisaci\u00f3n. C4 es miembro fundador del colectivo de ensambles de m\u00fasica popular venezolana Movida Ac\u00fastica Urbana con quienes grabaron, en 2009, un CD en vivo que recoge el trabajo de las seis agrupaciones que lo conforman. Asimismo, est\u00e1 previsto para el 2010 el lanzamiento de el DVD MAU en vivo, grabado en septiembre de 2009 en el Aula Magna de la Universidad Central de Venezuela. En el 2013, unen talentos con el ic\u00f3nico cantante venezolano Gualberto Ibarreto en un disco titulado \"Gualberto + C4\", que fue nominado al Latin Grammy 2013 y los hizo acreedores de 3 premios Pepsi Music. Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s tarde, grabaron el CD \"De Repente\" junto a Rafael \"Pollo\" Brito, con el que realizaron una exitosa gira nacional y ganaron un Latin Grammy y siete premios Pepsi Music. En el a\u00f1o 2015, iniciaron la grabaci\u00f3n de un DVD como celebraci\u00f3n de una d\u00e9cada de trabajo art\u00edstico junto a grandes figuras de la m\u00fasica como Aquiles B\u00e1ez, Rafael Pollo Brito, Guaco, Desorden P\u00fablico, Servando Primera, Oscar D' Le\u00f3n, Francisco Pacheco, Jos\u00e9 Alejandro Delgado, Betsayda Machado. Ese mismo a\u00f1o celebraron su primera d\u00e9cada con un concierto a sala llena en el Teatro Teresa Carre\u00f1o. Actualmente trabajan en la producci\u00f3n de un dicos junto a la banda de ska Desorden P\u00fablico y planean llevar su sonido a varias ciudades de Europa. The origins of C4 Tr\u00edo is directly connected with the international competition \u201cLa Siembra del Cuatro\u201d, created by Professor Cheo Hurtado, in which Jorge Glem, H\u00e9ctor Molina and Edward Ram\u00edrez had excellent performances as cuatristas in 2004 and 2005. For this reason, in November 2005, these three musicians were invited, along with a fourth cuatrista, Rafael Mart\u00ednez, to participate in a concert coordinated by Multifon\u00eda Foundation. During this concert, each one of them would show their skills performing solos in cuatro, but then, these musicians decided spontaneously to perform making duos, then trios, and finally a quartet for the closure of the concert. That specific moment caused a strong effect on the genesis of this ensemble having the Venezuelan cuatro as the main instrument. Coming from different Venezuelan cities, Jorge Glem from Cuman\u00e1, H\u00e9ctor Molina from M\u00e9rida and Edward Ram\u00edrez from Caracas, they converged in the Venezuelan capital to shape up one of the most important music proposal of the last years. In 2006, the group assumed definitely the name C4 Tr\u00edo after the recording of their first self-titled album under the music production of Aquiles B\u00e1ez, having also the participation of many national important groups and musicians such as Serenata Guayanesa, Rafael \"el Pollo\" Brito, Marina Bravo, Zeneida Rodr\u00edguez, Adolfo Herrera, Roberto Koch, Edwin Arellano and Aquiles B\u00e1ez him-self. In just a few weeks, the album became a music reference in Venezuela, reaching a double Golden Record because of the number of sold out copies. This discography production trigged C4 Tr\u00edo\u2019s popularity, making possible to have an intense artistic activity on the most prestigious Venezuelan stages and a great international agenda, taking them twice to the Venezuelan Sounds Festival (2006, 2007) coordinated by the Embassy of Venezuela in the United States, including concerts in the Bol\u00edvar Hall of Washington, Smithsonian Institution Building, The Castle and in the Kennedy Center. In England, the trio participated at the Salisbury International Art Festival 2007 and performed at the Bolivar Hall in London. In 2008, they performed at the Salon Azul de la Independencia (Blue Hall of Independence) in Montevideo, Uruguay and in the Mercado Cultural de Bahia (Cultural Market of Bahia) in Brazil. They had also shared stage with a significant number of national and international important artists like Jorge Drexler, Soledad Bravo, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Rafael \u201cel Pollo\u201d Brito, El Cuarteto, Edmar Casta\u00f1eda, Eddy Marcano, Juan Tom\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez, Aquiles B\u00e1ez, Alexis C\u00e1rdenas, Cheo Hurtado, Gonzalo Teppa, among others. In 2009, C4 Tr\u00edo released a second album Entre Manos (Among Hands), including a CD plus a live DVD, exposing the skills of these three talented musicians onstage. Entre manos illustrates a new feature much more mature of the group with compositions of all the integrants and also having participations of some important guests like Alexis C\u00e1rdenas, Yonathan Gavidia, Jorge Torres, Jos\u00e9 Alejandro Delgado and Rodner Padilla, who since 2009 joined definitively C4 Tr\u00edo as a bassist, enriching even more the music proposal of the group characterized by tackling a uncommon repertoire for cuatro, exploding a countless number of sound resources and adding also to the performances a large improvisation percentage. C4 Tr\u00edo is a founder member of the collective project Movida Ac\u00fastica Urbana, MAU (Urban Acoustic Gathering) with whom they recorded in 2009 a live album along with the work of other five Venezuelan groups. The MAU will release the DVD version in 2010 recorded in September 2009 at the Aula Magna of the Central University of Venezuela. In 2013 , they joined forces with the iconic Venezuelan singer Gualberto Ibarreto on a CD entitled \" Gualberto + C4 \" which was nominated for a Latin Grammy 2013 and won 3 Pepsi Music Awards . A year later , they recorded the CD \" De Repente \" with Rafael \"Pollo\" Brito , with which they held a successful national tour and won a Latin Grammy Award and seven Pepsi Music Awards. In 2015 , they began recording a DVD as a celebration of a decade of artistic work with great musical figures as Aquiles B\u00e1ez , Rafael Pollo Brito, Guaco , Desorden P\u00fablico, Servando Primera, Oscar D'Leon , Francisco Pacheco, Jose Alejandro Delgado, Betsayda Machado. That same year they celebrated their first decade with a concert to a full house at the Teresa Carreno Theater. Currently they are working in the production of a CD with the band of ska Desorden P\u00fablico and plan to take their sound to several cities in Europe. @c4trio / www.c4trio.com / c4trio@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "Desde hace tiempo hemos estado trabajando en una serie de Masterclasses para ustedes, en ese espacio nos adentramos en la m\u00fasica de C4 Tr\u00edo.\n\nNo solo invitamos a los cuatristas y bajistas sino a todo aquel (m\u00fasico y no m\u00fasico) que est\u00e9 curioso e interesado en nuestra manera de abordar la m\u00fasica.\n\nTodos estan bienvenidos y los esperamos!\n\nLa primera masterclass de la serie ser\u00e1 :\n\nLa Percusi\u00f3n Desde el Cuatro en C4 Tri\u00f3 con Jorge Glem, que tomara lugar el s\u00e1bado 30 de mayo de 11am - 12pm (hora de NYC)\n\n* Se solicita un m\u00ednimo $10.00 USD para poder tener acceso a est\u00e1 masterclass.\n\nEstamos manejando estos precios simb\u00f3licos porque queremos que \u00a1todos todos nos puedan acompa\u00f1ar y disfrutar de estas Masterclasses!\n\nComo saben, debido a la pandemia mundial la industria de la m\u00fasica se ha visto fuertemente afectada.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa.

Peddling a kind of jangly guitar pop not dissimilar to their Scottish contemporaries Aztec Camera and Orange Juice, they had three hit singles in the UK, all written by guitarist and founder member Bobby Bluebell (aka Robert Hodgens) - \"I'm Falling\" with Ken McCluskey , \"Cath\", and their biggest success \"Young At Heart\". The latter was co-written with Siobhan Fahey (with whom Hodgens was romantically linked for a while) and made it to No.8 in the UK singles chart on its original release in 1984. The band also released two albums, \"The Bluebells\" and \"Sisters\".\n\nThe band split up in the mid-1980s, but enjoyed an unexpected - albeit brief - revival in 1993 when \"Young At Heart\" was used in a Volkswagen TV commercial. Re-issued as a single, it was No.1 for four weeks and led to the band reforming temporarily to perform the song on Top of the Pops. A singles collection followed.\n\nAt the time of the 1990s revival, band member Lawrence Donegan - who trained as a journalist after the band's demise and is now golfing correspondent for The Guardian - wrote a newspaper article reminiscing about his days as a Bluebell which caused some friction between himself and the rest of the band. Amongst other anecdotes, he claimed that the group took part in a talent contest in Los Angeles in 1984, where a fellow contestant - an up-and-coming singer called Madonna - blew cigarette smoke into the band's faces and declared them to be \"losers\". The other ex-Bluebells are adamant that no such incident took place. Donegan has also published 'California Dreaming', a book based on his experiences selling used cars in Los Angeles.\n\nThe other members of the band stayed in the music business after the split. David McCluskey and his brother, Ken, formed a folk duo (www.myspace.com/mccluskeybrothers) . Robert Hodgens formed Up. Craig Gannon briefly filled in for bassist Andy Rourke in The Smiths on tour, then stayed as a second live guitarist; he joined The Adult Net after being fired from the Smiths in 1986.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Graeme Park ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wuh Oh ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Declan Welsh ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8314119.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Often At The Same Time, Words And Tunes", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "P U N C H N A Z I S", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Van T's ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9618284.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Alternative, Folk", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Aaron Smith ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8555240.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Singer, Songwriter", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer/Songwriter based out of Sumner, IA.

They took their name from the Scritti Politti song, \"Gettin, havin' and holdin'\".\n\nIn 1994 Wet Wet Wet had their biggest hit, with a cover version of the The Troggs single \"Love Is All Around\", which was a huge international success and spent 15 weeks at Number 1 in the British charts. Only Marti Pellow's insistence on deletion (he was bored of its chart domination, and overheard people complaining about it) prevented the song from possibly equalling and breaking, the record for the longest-standing Number 1 single, held by Bryan Adams.\nThe song was used on the soundtrack to the film Four Weddings and a Funeral. In the official UK best-selling singles list issued in 2002, it was placed 11th.\n\nDuring the rest of the 1990s the band maintained a strong UK following, although success in the singles charts became more sporadic. Pellow quit the band and went into rehab to battle a debilitating heroin addiction, while Tommy Cunningham resigned acrimoniously.\nPellow succeeded in kicking his habit, and returned to the public eye in 2001, with a solo album. In 2003, the Pellow and Cunnigham cautiously reformed with Graeme Clark and Neil Mitchell in order to work on a new record, and a single called \"All I Want\" which was released in October 2004.\n\nWet Wet Wet reunited in 2004 for a successful tour in the UK, and released a Greatest Hits album.\n\nIn 2005 Wet Wet Wet played at the Summer Weekender in England, and were one of the headline acts at Live 8 Edinburgh.\n\nWet Wet Wet's latest album Timeless was released in 2007.\n\nFor photographs and additional information visit Wet Wet Wet's official website, www.WetWetWet.co.uk .", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Roly Mo ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Luke La Volpe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9149203.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Blues, Rock", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The band formed in July 2017, each of the members have had their own separate music careers however started playing together for fun and then formed the band after realising their potential.

Y es a ra\u00edz de ello cuando, en noviembre de 2005, estos tres m\u00fasicos fueron invitados, junto a un cuarto cuatrista, Rafael Mart\u00ednez, a participar en un concierto organizado por la Fundaci\u00f3n Multifon\u00eda. All\u00ed, cada uno har\u00eda una muestra de su trabajo como solista, pero espont\u00e1neamente estos m\u00fasicos decidieron hacer d\u00faos, tr\u00edos y un cierre final a cuarteto. Este momento marc\u00f3 la g\u00e9nesis de este ensamble que tiene como figura predominante el cuatro venezolano. De diferentes ciudades de Venezuela, Jorge Glem de Cuman\u00e1, H\u00e9ctor Molina de M\u00e9rida y Edward Ram\u00edrez de Caracas, convergieron en la capital venezolana para dar forma a una de las propuestas musicales m\u00e1s importantes de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. En el a\u00f1o 2006, la agrupaci\u00f3n asume definitivamente el nombre de C4 Tr\u00edo, gracias a la grabaci\u00f3n de su primera producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica que estuvo bajo la producci\u00f3n musical de Aquiles B\u00e1ez y que cont\u00f3 con la participaci\u00f3n de un nutrido grupo de m\u00fasicos venezolanos, como Serenata Guayanesa, Rafael \"el Pollo\" Brito, Marina Bravo, Zeneida Rodr\u00edguez, Adolfo Herrera, Roberto Koch, Edwin Arellano y el propio Aquiles B\u00e1ez. R\u00e1pidamente, el disco compacto se convirti\u00f3 en una referencia de la m\u00fasica en Venezuela y en poco tiempo pas\u00f3 a ser doble Disco de Oro por el n\u00famero de copias vendidas. Esta producci\u00f3n dispar\u00f3 la popularidad de C4 Tr\u00edo, permiti\u00e9ndoles tener una intensa actividad en las m\u00e1s prestigiosas salas de Venezuela y una fuerte agenda internacional que los ha llevado, en dos ediciones \u20132005 y 2006\u2013, al Festival Venezuelan Sounds, organizado por la Embajada de Venezuela en Estados Unidos, que incluy\u00f3 conciertos en el Bol\u00edvar Hall de Washington, Smithsonian Institution Building, The Castle y Kennedy Center; en 2007, a Inglaterra al Salisbury Intertantional Art Festival 2007 y Bol\u00edvar Hall de Londres; en 2008, al Sal\u00f3n Azul de la Intendencia de Montevideo-Uruguay y al Mercado Cultural de Bah\u00eda 2008, en Brasil. As\u00ed mismo, ha compartido escena con un nutrido n\u00famero de artistas nacionales e internacionales, entre los que cabe destacar a Jorge Drexler, Soledad Bravo, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Rafael \u201cel Pollo\u201d Brito, El Cuarteto, Edmar Casta\u00f1eda, Eddy Marcano, Juan Tom\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez, Aquiles B\u00e1ez, Alexis C\u00e1rdenas, Cheo Hurtado, Gonzalo Teppa, entre otros. En 2009, C4 lanza al mercado su segunda producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica, Entre manos, que viene acompa\u00f1ada, adem\u00e1s, de un DVD donde el grupo muestra su desempe\u00f1o en un concierto en vivo. Entre manos muestra una faceta mucho m\u00e1s madura de la agrupaci\u00f3n, incluye composiciones de sus integrantes y las participaciones como invitados de Alexis C\u00e1rdenas, Yonathan Gavidia, Jorge Torres, Jos\u00e9 Alejandro Delgado y Rodner Padilla quien, desde este mismo a\u00f1o, comienza a formar parte definitiva de C4 como bajista, lo que ha enriquecido a\u00fan m\u00e1s la propuesta musical de la agrupaci\u00f3n, caracterizada por abordar un repertorio no tan com\u00fan para el cuatro, con el que se explota un sinf\u00edn de recursos sonoros, agregando a sus interpretaciones un porcentaje importante de improvisaci\u00f3n. C4 es miembro fundador del colectivo de ensambles de m\u00fasica popular venezolana Movida Ac\u00fastica Urbana con quienes grabaron, en 2009, un CD en vivo que recoge el trabajo de las seis agrupaciones que lo conforman. Asimismo, est\u00e1 previsto para el 2010 el lanzamiento de el DVD MAU en vivo, grabado en septiembre de 2009 en el Aula Magna de la Universidad Central de Venezuela. En el 2013, unen talentos con el ic\u00f3nico cantante venezolano Gualberto Ibarreto en un disco titulado \"Gualberto + C4\", que fue nominado al Latin Grammy 2013 y los hizo acreedores de 3 premios Pepsi Music. Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s tarde, grabaron el CD \"De Repente\" junto a Rafael \"Pollo\" Brito, con el que realizaron una exitosa gira nacional y ganaron un Latin Grammy y siete premios Pepsi Music. En el a\u00f1o 2015, iniciaron la grabaci\u00f3n de un DVD como celebraci\u00f3n de una d\u00e9cada de trabajo art\u00edstico junto a grandes figuras de la m\u00fasica como Aquiles B\u00e1ez, Rafael Pollo Brito, Guaco, Desorden P\u00fablico, Servando Primera, Oscar D' Le\u00f3n, Francisco Pacheco, Jos\u00e9 Alejandro Delgado, Betsayda Machado. Ese mismo a\u00f1o celebraron su primera d\u00e9cada con un concierto a sala llena en el Teatro Teresa Carre\u00f1o. Actualmente trabajan en la producci\u00f3n de un dicos junto a la banda de ska Desorden P\u00fablico y planean llevar su sonido a varias ciudades de Europa. The origins of C4 Tr\u00edo is directly connected with the international competition \u201cLa Siembra del Cuatro\u201d, created by Professor Cheo Hurtado, in which Jorge Glem, H\u00e9ctor Molina and Edward Ram\u00edrez had excellent performances as cuatristas in 2004 and 2005. For this reason, in November 2005, these three musicians were invited, along with a fourth cuatrista, Rafael Mart\u00ednez, to participate in a concert coordinated by Multifon\u00eda Foundation. During this concert, each one of them would show their skills performing solos in cuatro, but then, these musicians decided spontaneously to perform making duos, then trios, and finally a quartet for the closure of the concert. That specific moment caused a strong effect on the genesis of this ensemble having the Venezuelan cuatro as the main instrument. Coming from different Venezuelan cities, Jorge Glem from Cuman\u00e1, H\u00e9ctor Molina from M\u00e9rida and Edward Ram\u00edrez from Caracas, they converged in the Venezuelan capital to shape up one of the most important music proposal of the last years. In 2006, the group assumed definitely the name C4 Tr\u00edo after the recording of their first self-titled album under the music production of Aquiles B\u00e1ez, having also the participation of many national important groups and musicians such as Serenata Guayanesa, Rafael \"el Pollo\" Brito, Marina Bravo, Zeneida Rodr\u00edguez, Adolfo Herrera, Roberto Koch, Edwin Arellano and Aquiles B\u00e1ez him-self. In just a few weeks, the album became a music reference in Venezuela, reaching a double Golden Record because of the number of sold out copies. This discography production trigged C4 Tr\u00edo\u2019s popularity, making possible to have an intense artistic activity on the most prestigious Venezuelan stages and a great international agenda, taking them twice to the Venezuelan Sounds Festival (2006, 2007) coordinated by the Embassy of Venezuela in the United States, including concerts in the Bol\u00edvar Hall of Washington, Smithsonian Institution Building, The Castle and in the Kennedy Center. In England, the trio participated at the Salisbury International Art Festival 2007 and performed at the Bolivar Hall in London. In 2008, they performed at the Salon Azul de la Independencia (Blue Hall of Independence) in Montevideo, Uruguay and in the Mercado Cultural de Bahia (Cultural Market of Bahia) in Brazil. They had also shared stage with a significant number of national and international important artists like Jorge Drexler, Soledad Bravo, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Rafael \u201cel Pollo\u201d Brito, El Cuarteto, Edmar Casta\u00f1eda, Eddy Marcano, Juan Tom\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez, Aquiles B\u00e1ez, Alexis C\u00e1rdenas, Cheo Hurtado, Gonzalo Teppa, among others. In 2009, C4 Tr\u00edo released a second album Entre Manos (Among Hands), including a CD plus a live DVD, exposing the skills of these three talented musicians onstage. Entre manos illustrates a new feature much more mature of the group with compositions of all the integrants and also having participations of some important guests like Alexis C\u00e1rdenas, Yonathan Gavidia, Jorge Torres, Jos\u00e9 Alejandro Delgado and Rodner Padilla, who since 2009 joined definitively C4 Tr\u00edo as a bassist, enriching even more the music proposal of the group characterized by tackling a uncommon repertoire for cuatro, exploding a countless number of sound resources and adding also to the performances a large improvisation percentage. C4 Tr\u00edo is a founder member of the collective project Movida Ac\u00fastica Urbana, MAU (Urban Acoustic Gathering) with whom they recorded in 2009 a live album along with the work of other five Venezuelan groups. The MAU will release the DVD version in 2010 recorded in September 2009 at the Aula Magna of the Central University of Venezuela. In 2013 , they joined forces with the iconic Venezuelan singer Gualberto Ibarreto on a CD entitled \" Gualberto + C4 \" which was nominated for a Latin Grammy 2013 and won 3 Pepsi Music Awards . A year later , they recorded the CD \" De Repente \" with Rafael \"Pollo\" Brito , with which they held a successful national tour and won a Latin Grammy Award and seven Pepsi Music Awards. In 2015 , they began recording a DVD as a celebration of a decade of artistic work with great musical figures as Aquiles B\u00e1ez , Rafael Pollo Brito, Guaco , Desorden P\u00fablico, Servando Primera, Oscar D'Leon , Francisco Pacheco, Jose Alejandro Delgado, Betsayda Machado. That same year they celebrated their first decade with a concert to a full house at the Teresa Carreno Theater.

Stamped with her affinity for finely crafted melodies and intricate storytelling, the project encompasses a blend of American music melding Rock, Soul, Rhythm and Blues, Country and Gospel. Maggie's recent album Change The Whole Thing was named by Rolling Stone as one of the \"Best Albums of 2018.\"\n\nThe resilient powerhouse recorded this album at the famed Starstruck Studios in Nashville, TN implementing an impressively demanding method highlighting an artist in complete command of her ever-evolving creative process: live with her 13-piece \u201cfamily band\u201d in one take, no overdubs, no bullshit and a sound that is best described by the following quote from Rolling Stone:\n\n\u201cMaggie Rose has come into her own with this current earth-conscious, trippy country-soul stage of her ever-evolving musical persona...Rose\u2019s performances [during CMA Fest and Bonnaroo] showed her embracing her inner soul diva, belting with fire on \u2018It's You\u2019 and the pulverizing \u2018Pull You Through.\u2019 Just to drive the point home, Rose and her band even stretched out on a swinging cover of \u2018The Letter,\u2019 doing a more-than-respectable impression of the funky Mad Dogs & Englishmen arrangement originally sung by Joe Cocker.\u201d\n\nLeading to the Fall album launch, Rose incrementally released four Digital 45s from her forthcoming project beginning in October 2017 to both satisfy and build the anticipation of her growing fanbase. The initial 45 earned her a spot in the Top 10 on Sirius XM with the \u201csmoldering\u201d A-side, \u201cPull You Through.\u201d The \u201cpulverizing\u201d single was hailed by Rolling Stone as a \u201csoulful ballad that rejoices in the healing powers of love...a bare-bones track [that is] really a showcase for the Dusty Springfield-worthy vocals of Rose\u2026\u201d.\n\nIn Spring of 2018, Maggie released \"It's You\" and \"Smooth.\" Rolling Stone once again praised Maggie Rose with \"It's You\" as \u201ca giant, throwback Soul ballad that shows off her dynamic vocals [containing] shades of Aretha Franklin,\u201d and also praised \"Smooth\" as \"a supremely funky rocker with hints of Grace Potter [and] Janis Joplin\".\n\nThe enthusiasm surrounding each Digital 45 release has continually increased the appetite of her fans while relentlessly expanding her following via radio, streaming platforms and through her captivating live performances. The full-length album will feature 12 songs, 12 live in-studio videos, with a full-access behind-the-scenes one-hour musical documentary which peels back the layers and allows the viewer an intimate look into the making of the album.\n\nRose has been named to YouTube\u2019s Emerging Artist and Artist in Residence 2018 programs, and Pandora named her an Artist to Watch 2018. In June, Maggie\u2019s creative breadth and versatility sparked the first-ever partnership between Prescription Songs and Sea Gayle Music, with the two companies signing a joint-venture publishing agreement with Rose. In July, she was tapped for an as-named synchronization deal that lends her voice to a national ad campaign focusing on Women\u2019s Empowerment.\n\nIn 2018, Maggie Rose has played over 150 dates across the world including\nBonnaroo Music and Arts Festival and The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, while sharing the stage with artists such as Kelly Clarkson, Julia Michaels, Brandy Clark, and Bob Weir of Grateful Dead.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Suu ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9134691.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Barcelona,Spain", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Aquesta \u00e9s la meva p\u00e0gina oficial on anir\u00e9 penjant els meus temes i compartint els meus esdeveniments per mantenir-vos informats en tot moment.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kraft ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Metal, Black Metal", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "ATF ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/240841.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Col\u00e9 van dais ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10352089.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Rock, World Music, Alternative Rock, Adult Contemporary, African, Pop, Indie, Jazz", "Time": "4:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Cole van dais is an independent singer/ songwriter from South Africa performing original music, covers and tribute shows.\nFor more info and updates go to www.colevandais.com\n\nCol\u00e9 sings at festivals, theatres, country clubs, and corporate functions.

It\u2019s a musical relationship that has endured for over two decades, with band members playing in numerous projects together and apart. Following the 2012 release of their freewheeling Sounds Like This, the band took time off to work on various side projects. Zach Gill (keys/vocals) toured the world with the band\u2019s college pal Jack Johnson; Dan \u201cLebo\u201d Lebowitz (guitar/vocals) played shows with the Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh; Steve Adams (bass/vocals) toured and recorded with Nicki Bluhm & the Gramblers; Dave Brogan (drums/vocals) joined up with Utah band, Mokie. These and other endeavors have influenced the band\u2019s new album Tangle Of Time.\n\nMore than previous releases, Tangle Of Time really taps into what makes ALO unique. It\u2019s that special blend of classic songwriting and the ability to stretch out jams and distill dance floor grooves. It's heartfelt lyrics that make you smile, reflect and just want to sing along either way. It's four great musicians who all write and sing. And four friends who've been through a lot together and still support, challenge and inspire one another.\n\nEntering Allegiant Records in San Anselmo, California this past January with co-producer Dave Simon-Baker, the four members decided they\u2019d take a different recording approach. Instead of spending pre-production days jamming and co-writing, each member brought in their own demos, roughly three dozen in total, for the group to listen to, pick apart and eventually whittle down to the 11 songs that make up Tangle Of Time. Once they narrowed their focus, they turned their attention to arrangements and production techniques. Songs were tightened up, layers made more experimental and the end results validated their new approach.\n\nLebo described the shared respect and admiration the band felt during the recording process this way: \"There are four strong opinions in the room, but playing together for so long we've all become pretty good at the empathy thing at this point; we can be very Zen about it. We truly value being together at this point in our careers, and whatever we get from our solo and side gigs, no matter how much fun we have, it's not this.\"\n\nThat sort of maturity, the ability to take stock of your friends, loved ones, and collaborators, and truly appreciate them is certainly one of the cornerstones of Tangle Of Time. Lebo, Adams and Gill first started playing music together in middle school, and then with Brogan right after college. Somehow, these relationships have lasted, evolved and been made stronger every year. One can almost hear the group releasing a satisfied existential sigh throughout the album, finding acceptance, love and contentment with the world they've built.\n\n\"I really appreciate the guys right now, more so than ever,\" Gill shared, excitedly adding, \"Years ago the feeling was, 'I wanna get to my songs and see how they sound while we're all here', whereas now I'm rooting for everyone else's songs. It's great.\"\n\nThat approach of supporting each other\u2019s songs worked like a charm, capturing each member\u2019s distinct songwriting voice, while simultaneously expanding the notion of what an ALO song or album can be. Take for instance the one-two-punch of the synth-filled, spacey jam vehicle \"The Ticket\" and the pedal steel-driven easy-going happiness of \"Simple Times\". Although two ends of the sonic spectrum, both are classic Gill songs at their core but stretched wide and far by the band\u2019s collective effort.\n\nNot to be outdone, Lebo's guitar epic \"Undertow\" is a song that practically begs to be stretched out live, with its swirling double guitar outro intoxicating the listener to such a degree that you might find yourself on the band's website, dreamily purchasing tickets for an entire run of shows just to see where the song ventures live. Lebo pairs this with \"Push\", a jaunty yet thoughtful number with a playful guitar riff that's basically the musical equivalent of joy.\n\n\"Not Old Yet\" and \"Keep On\", Adams\u2019 contributions to the album, are also touchstones to the spirit of Tangle Of Time. The first is a light-hearted romp about keeping a positive perspective on life\u2019s long road of hurdles and surprises, while the second is an upbeat, forward-thinking sing-along with lines that could be the album's mantra: \"Wherever this takes us, I know/That we've got each other, we've still got a long way to go.\"\n\nBrogan's \"Coast To Coast\" is among the most intriguing songs on the record. He, along with co-writer buddy Ben Malan, came up with a layer-upon-layer soundscape consisting of beautifully esoteric textures. The funky but ominous track tells the surreal tale of a band on the run, with more ideas and energy than know-how. Brogan shared that the theme of \u201ctangled time\u201d materialized unexpectedly over the course of the sessions, elaborating: \"There's a point where there is more behind you than ahead of you, and you realize that time becomes a limiting factor.\"\n\nPut the record on your turntable, and you can clearly hear the band\u2019s excitement to get back on the road and explore these songs with their audience. Improvisation is a staple of what the band does, and as Adams stated: \"Being in that unknown is such a great life lesson beyond just the music. For all the careful planning and preparing we do, being in the moment is really when it all matters.\"\n\nThe band is also planning new ways to expand the theatrical shenanigans that have become a fantastic complement to the live show. From confetti canons to 12-foot beach balls, pre-show skits to elaborate theme nights, bubble suits to a laser-shooting ukulele (yes, really)... ALO is always on the hunt for new and exciting ways to interact with fans to make their shows truly special. Gill, the band's head prankster, put it this way: \"I want people to come to a show expecting to be engaged in a fun and creative way. When I see someone dancing or singing along or reaching out to hit a giant beach ball, I start playing to the dancer and at that point, it's really a circle of energy traveling back and forth from the stage. The larger theatrical concepts are ways of interacting with the audience on another level.\"\n\nOn Tangle Of Time the band has reached that other level, and are ready to bring everyone along.", "otherInfo": "60+ artists, one day!

Born on the Jazz & Heritage Festival stage, and descended from Neville family bloodlines, these soldiers of funk ignite a deep, gritty groove that dares listeners not to move. Their performances combine ingenious musicianship and complex funk and jazz arrangements with soulful melodies that are simple enough for anyone to enjoy. In Big Easy tradition, dueling baselines from Tony Hall and Nick Daniels III set off one of the dirtiest rhythm sections on the planet, while Ivan Neville lights up the Hammond B3 keys and cousin Ian Neville\u2019s funky guitar riffs send the groove into overdrive. The band recently welcomed their newest member, Alvin Ford Jr. to the quintet, a New Orleans born and raised powerhouse drummer. Dumpstaphunk tosses around lead vocals and four-part harmonies the way Sly & the Family Stone did, but with three studio albums under their belt, Dumpstaphunk stands on the merit of their own material. Songs like \u201cDancin\u2019 To The Truth\u201d off their latest record, Dirty Word (July 30, 2013, Louisiana Red Hot Records), offer an escape into the funky sublime, sharing the true spirit of New Orleans with every note.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kuroi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8265268.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Rapcore, Nu Metal, Techno Music Producer And Dj, Punk, Metal", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "In 2003 Kuroi had her first contact with turntables. It was then when she realized she was made for being a successful and professional artist. Since that moment, it became a priority in her life. In 2014 she released \"Lmnts\", her first work. This was along with a label Aconito Records, an international label which its main headquarters in London. It is well-known for discovering several artists such as Deepbass, Ness, Claudio PRC and Giorgio Gigli. In 2015 she released her second reference named \"Environments\", which also occurred in this competent and famous label. In 2016 she made her debut in a triumphant sub-label of Dynamic Reflection called \" The Nursery\"( Sub-Label of Dynamic Reflection)and Sonntag Morgen. Kuroi's vision of techno is quite unique and different from those of other artists. She uses her own vision and applies it to her sounds, which include a wide variety of modulated and analog synths. Her first performances took place at several raves, later on she made her own path through some of the most important and mythical techno clubs in Madrid. These include Stardust, Cassette, Specka, Audium and One. Kuroi's sets are goodly welcomed by the audience as her performances are based on live and direct sounds which you can easily dance to. Another important factor that distinguishes Kuroi from the rest is that she has good adaptability skills, this means that she knows how to adapt her sounds to the audience and to the club. She is currently one of the most competent and successful deejays in her hometown, Madrid. Furthermore, Kuroi has had the pleasure to perform in remarkable clubs where techno emerged such as Tresor and About Blank in Berlin. In few words, a live session of Dj Kuroi will allow you to enjoy a wide variety of rhythms full of energy and strong feelings.

Young and Holt left in 1966 to form the Young-Holt Trio and were replaced by Cleveland Eaton and Maurice White. White was replaced by Maurice Jennings in 1970. In the late 1970s an additional keyboard player was frequently added to the lineup. A contemporary version of \"The In Crowd\" was recorded for Lewis' 2004 album, Time Flies.\n\nRamsey Lewis has received seven gold records and three Grammy Awards so far in his career.\n\nHis recent \"With One Voice\" release pays homage to his gospel roots all while maintaining his classic style. With the help of gospel favorites Smokie Norful, Darius Brooks, and Donald Lawrence, Lewis delivers an emotion-packed, soul-stirring, album. Lewis also enlisted the help of his church's choir, pastored by his older sister, to sing on several of the album's tracks. The J.W. James Memorial A.M.E. Church Combined Choir is breath-taking, adding so much life, freedom, and hope to \"With One Voice\".

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "The Allaire Show w/ Guest DB Cohen Streaming Live!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Venerus ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tim Burgess ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8263503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tim Burgess (born Timothy Allan Burgess on May 30, 1967, in Salford, Lancashire, England) is the lead singer of British rock/indie act The Charlatans.

I\u2019m Ruth\u2026welcome to my little world! I\u2019m just an ordinary girl-next-door with an extraordinary dream. (Dreams are good. I hope you have lots of them:)\nI grew up in rural western NY on a vineyard that\u2019s been in my family for over a hundred years. My grandma was the farmer\u2019s daughter and my grandpa worked on the grapes with her dad. That\u2019s how they met\u2026 Cute huh?\nMusic has been a part of my life since forever. I started playing piano and fiddle when I was three. I sang my first solo at church that year \u2013 and I also wrote my first song titled \u201cMr. Bluebird\u201d \u2013 my mom swears it was the same every time I sang it! Three was clearly a big year for me! But it was middle school when I fell in love with country music. This was 90s country at it\u2019s best \u2013 artists like Garth Brooks, Jo Dee Messina and Faith Hill were killing it on country radio and I couldn\u2019t get enough. I loved the stories they were telling through their songs. In high school it all came together when I started writing and playing the guitar. I was hooked.\nI get asked all the time how a girl from NY could possibly sing country music. Well I have a couple things to say about that: A) They play George Straight in the Wal-Mart where I\u2019m from too and B) My high school mascot was the Fredonia Hillbillies\u2026doesn\u2019t get much more country than that, does it?\nAfter graduating high school I attended Berklee College of Music where I majored in songwriting and made some lifelong friends. I fell in love with Boston (go Red Sox!) but I struggled to find my artistic voice during those years. So with hope in my heart I decided to make the move to Music City.\nWhen I moved to Nashville I started to write with everyone I could. I wrote all the time, sometimes several songs in one day and I was blessed by the support and feedback of so many talented co-writers. Within months, I finally felt like I was writing songs that were me, and through these songs, I found my voice.\nDuring this time I formed the duo Wild Honey, with another local songwriter, Victoria Gibson and we were featured on Season 1 of CMT\u2019s Can You Duet. Being on Can You Duet was the wildest experience. One week I\u2019m waiting tables and the next I\u2019m moving into the Opryland Hotel for a month of filming. Suddenly there were cameras and lights shoved in our faces almost 24 hours a day. The stakes were raised in a big way. The best way I can put it is this\u2026 where I\u2019m from, a tiny little town in NY, I never dared to dream that big\u2026 It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want to sing for stadiums of millions of people\u2026 It\u2019s just that I never believed that it could happen to a small town girl like me. But all of a sudden, there I was competing on national television for a major label record deal. Can You Duet gave me the push I needed to realize that dreams do come true\u2026even for normal little people like me.\nAfter Can You Duet, it was on. I worked as hard as I could, writing everyday and back to waiting tables, sometimes till 4 in the morning to make ends meet. All that changed when I signed with Curb Records and Curb Publishing in the summer of 2011. That was a quite the summer! Within 3 months I got married, bought a house and signed a record deal! Whew\u2026 let me tell you, that was a much needed honeymoon:)\nI still live in Nashville, TN, now with my sweet husband and our two tiny dogs (Emmylou and Hazel). And I am so blessed to get to do music everyday. Sometimes when I\u2019m driving down to Music Row in the morning, (that\u2019s where the magic happens here in Nashvegas) I\u2019ll stop for a second and think \u201cI get to hang out my friends today and write a song\u201d???!!!! \u201cLike for my job\u201d???!!! Crazy!\nIt is a crazy life, but it\u2019s mine and I love it! I\u2019m currently recording my first album for Curb Records and it\u2019s SO exciting!!!\nThis record is the result of years of writing songs about the hurts and heartbreaks, joys and blessings, wild rides and sunny days that we all experience. This album represents everything I\u2019ve gone through while chasing down and exploring this wonderful adventure called music. In these songs, I tried to express the emotion we all go through while searching through the storm to find the light, love and home. I hope you love it!:)\nSo that\u2019s my story\u2026 That\u2019s me\u2026 I\u2019m just an ordinary girl-next-door with an extraordinary dream. As I\u2019m out there chasing mine, I hope you\u2019re somewhere out there chasing yours!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Snow Patrol ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10336343.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Alternative Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Twenty-five years of Snow Patrol: where did it all go right?\n\nGary Lightbody has had plenty opportunity to ponder that over the last couple of years. The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear.

Leyla, a multi-instrumentalist, cellist and singer whose distinctive sound is impossible to replicate.\n\nLeyla\u2019s music reflects her eclectic and diverse life experiences, projecting a respect for eloquent simplicity that is rarely achieved. Born in New York City to Haitian emigrant parents, Leyla was raised in suburban New Jersey. As a teenager, she relocated to Accra, Ghana for two years. Upon her return, she attended Smith College for a year before transferring to New York University where she studied cello performance and chamber music. Armed with Bach\u2019s Cello Suites, Leyla moved to New Orleans to play cello on the streets of the French Quarter.\n\n\nIt is the move to New Orleans that signaled a journey of musical and cultural discovery for Leyla. \u201cNew Orleans always felt like home to me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe more I learned about the history of Louisiana, its ties to Haiti and French speaking culture, the more sense of belonging I felt and continue to feel.\u201d Most recently, Leyla has fallen in love with the late Louisiana Creole fiddlers Canray Fontenot and B\u00e9b\u00e9 Carri\u00e8re and has explored their fiddling styles on the cello.\n\n\nLeyla\u2019s move to New Orleans also signaled a new stage in her career. It was while playing on the street that she caught the attention of Tim Duffy, the founder and director of the Music Maker Relief Foundation. He invited Leyla to join the Music Maker Relief Foundation family and introduced her to the Carolina Chocolate Drops, a renowned African-American string band. After appearing on the band\u2019s GRAMMY-nominated album Leaving Eden and touring extensively with the group, she now focuses on her solo career.\n\n\nVari-Colored Songs: A Tribute to Langston Hughes, Leyla\u2019s debut album, is set for a February 2014 release. The album, which has been years in the making for Leyla, was given a push after a successful Kickstarter campaign in which she surpassed her $5,000 goal by four times to ultimately raise over $20,000. Vari-Colored Songs consists of compositions she has written to Langston Hughes poetry, Haitian folk songs and original pieces. The album features musicians including Rhiannon Giddens and Hubby Jenkins of the Carolina Chocolate Drops as well as New Orleans\u2019 own Don Vappie on tenor banjo and Luke Winslow King on guitar.", "otherInfo": "Equal parts festivity, community coalescence and fundraiser for the work of EqualHealth, the concert will be an hour of connection and joy through music and friendship.

Her powerful, heartfelt music defies genres, melding together electronica, Tunisian textures and a cinematic universe. Combining the political and the personal, Emel expresses not just her feelings but those of so many people. \"It is important to me to try to give voice to the silenced. I also believe, though, that art is its own message, that especially when you come from a repressive place, or an ignored place, the simple act of saying, 'Hey, I'm here,' is important - the art of presence and insistence.\"\n\nOn her sophomore album, Ensen, Emel distills her blend of acoustic and electronic sounds into a style that's even more uniquely her own, citing Ben Frost, Samaris and James Blake as influences. With several producers, including Valgeir Sigur\u00f0sson (Sigur Ros, Feist) and her main collaborator French/Tunisian producer Amine Metani, Emel recorded the new album across seven countries and two continents. \"We recorded acoustic takes of the songs, using a lot of North African drumming. Then we started creating our own library of organic beats running the percussions through our homemade effects and setups. They sounded like nothing we'd ever heard.\" \"Ensen Dhaif (Helpless Human),\" the title track, is propelled by sparkling gumbri (a Tunisian three stringed big bass lute, used in Gnawa music), feverish zukra (Tunisian flute), trance inducing bendirs (North African frame drums) and heavy kick drum.\n\nEmel's music has motivated many to express themselves, and she fights particularly hard to be a pillar of strength for women worldwide. \"Everyone assumes there is a man directing or 'pulling the strings' behind a female artist\" she says. \"It is unbelievable the macho attitudes I've had to overcome to make this album. I hope people see Ensen as a reminder that women create every day and a testament to the strength it can take to do so.\"\n\nBlessed with an exceptionally wide vocal range and expressive voice, Emel's impassioned live performances go far beyond the sounds on the album. \"I never perform the same way twice. I am more of a show person than a studio artist; the songs have a second life once the recording is done. I'm very free with my vocals.

Du\u00e9 le quartz disbanded in September of 2002, with Miyabi following up shortly afterwards with the announcement of his solo career.\n\nSolo Career: Miyabi appeared on TV to promote his debut album, Gagaku, also stressing the name change from \"Miyabi\" to \"\u96c5-miyavi.\" He continued to stress this change on into the first year of his solo career. It wasn't long before he had amassed a very large fanbase, despite having lost some of his old fanbase from his Du\u00e9 le quartz days, going on to release multiple singles and another album. About two years later, in late 2004, he was signed (or \"married\" as Universal and he had jokingly put it) to Universal Records Japan, making the transition from Indies to major. It was then that he made a second name change to MYV. As previously stated, however, it appears to be a shortened version of \"\u96c5-miyavi,\" as he still appears in magazines (and is listed on his website) as \"\u96c5-miyavi.\" His release, Rock no Gyakushuu -Super Star no Jouken-, marked his major debut.\n\nNew Band: S.K.I.N - After a four month long stay in America, \u96c5-miyavi accomplished something new, which might have come as a surprise for a few. Upon return to Japan, \u96c5-miyavi announced in a video comment (link posted on his official website) that he would like to \"try screaming in the background again\" and thus found an amazing guy (older than him) and will start their band in 2007. Although he did not say more, he also assured that he would also like to continue producing as a solo artist.\n\nIt has been confirmed that \u96c5-miyavi is part of the new super-band, S.K.I.N along with YOSHIKI, Gackt and Sugizo. They debuted on June 29th at Anime Expo, playing their first gig, during which it was announced that Ju-Ken (Gackt) would be their support member playing the bass.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Maliibu Miitch ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8747690.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hyolyn ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jay Park ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10072482.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Rap, R&b, Hip Hop", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mei ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8206061.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "London,United Kingdom", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "'Steppin' is OUT NOW!

The group's nucleus of composer/trackmaker/producer Taku and rapper Verbal first became friends while the two were attending St. Mary's International School, a Tokyo based international high school. Later Taku moved to California, where he worked as a DJ and began composing. At this juncture the ethnically Korean Verbal went to school in Boston, where he also got deeper into rap music. Verbal also got into Christianity, so much that he majored in theology, but his friend Taku convinced him to return to Tokyo to pursue music.\n\nIn 1998 they hooked up again in Tokyo, and brought into their musical circle the Japanese-Colombian female singer Lisa, who attended Seisen International School, St. Mary's sister school. Lisa had already begun working in music, including serving as vocalist for the group ram jam world. The group released their first song been so long as a 12-inch single on an indie label, and were soon picked up by the Avex-affiliated Rhythm Zone label. From Avex they released a string of hit singles, and then their debut album Planet Shining, which went to #6 on the Oricon album chart. The group followed this success up with the re-mix album THE REPLACEMENT PERCUSSIONISTS and a sold-out tour. The group also toured in Korea, where they were well received.\n\nTheir wide ranging popularity led to a number of side projects and collaborations, including Taku working on music by major stars like Hikaru Utada, Crystal Kay, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Yumi Matsutoya, and Verbal working with the Korean superstar female idol group S.E.S. One S.E.S. member, Shoo, was actually born in Yokohama and speaks Japanese, which helped allow the group to attain some level of popularity in Japan in addition to their mega-success in Korea. Verbal has also worked with the pop duos Heartsdales and Halicali, and up and coming foreign idol Christina Milian. In 2001 the group released EXPO EXPO, and again released a remix album and toured.\n\nIn 2002 Lisa released the self-produced single move on. The song it seems was an announcement of sorts, as soon after she announced that she was leaving m-flo to concentrate on a solo career. After Lisa's departure m-flo have continued on as a duo, often recording with other artists. They developed a concept of sorts, the \u201cm-flo loves **** \u201d series, with a guest artist\u2019s name filling in the blank, such as \u201cm-flo loves Akiko Wada\u201d. In May 2004 they released the CD Astromantic and followed it with a related DVD. Astromantic was an album full of collaborations, including cuts with such major artists as BoA, Chemistry, Double, Kenji Furuya (of Dragon Ash), Ken Yokoyama (of Crazy Ken Band), and Maki Nomiya (of Pizzicato Five), and eventually released a remix album, Astromantic Charm School, where other composers and mixers would remix the songs from Astromantic. Two years later, m-flo released the album Beat Space Nine, which featured such artists as Yoshika, Emyli, Diggy Mo of SOUL'd OUT, Akiko Wada, and even a song with Lisa. A remix album, Dope Space nine was released much like Charm School.\nRecently, an m-flo Inside WORKS BEST II has been released, bringing together some of their best tracks, and remixing them. As one can see, the group has done much, but will be going even further.\n\nSince going solo Lisa has released Juicy Music in April 2003, Gratitude in June 2004, and an album of cover versions, mostly American 1980\u2019s hits like Prince, Madonna and Cyndi Lauper, called Melody Circus in April 2005.\n\nMarch 30th 2007, M-Flo releases their new album Cosmicolor which all the songs are collaborations(except the interludes). A remix album featuring the songs from Cosmicolor was released(as expected) on September 26, 2007. With the end of the \"loves\" series m-flo's fans eagerly await their next move.\n\nVerbal from m-flo has his own blog here: http://ameblo.jp/m-flo-verbal/page-1.html He usually writes almost every day.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "FuntCase ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9229443.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Dubstep", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "OFFICIAL FUNTCASE FANPAGE PRESS LIKE FOR ALL INFO FUNTCASE BASED, INCLUDING: [[[Gigs, Releases, Up and Coming Tracks and many more...]]] Subscribe to my Channel: http://bit.ly/1apQMTd", "otherInfo": "Couch Lands is back with a brand new Virtual Stage featuring DJ sets by Doctor P, Funtcase, Ghastly, Riot Ten, Boogie T, ATLiens, PhaseOne and more!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "MoZella ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/252874.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "MoZella is a solo soul/pop solo artist from Detroit, United States.

It was during these formative years that Fokis developed a love for music and a work ethic that placed him amongst hip hop\u2019s hardest working entrepreneurs. Fokis began rhyming at an early age and later began to produce his own music. Seeking to enhance his career, Fokis pursued formal training as a recording engineer, later opening his own recording studio Krystal Clear Recordings. There, Fokis recorded and mixed for many artists including Big Daddy Kane, Fat Joe, Skyzoo, Torae, Dres, N.O.R.E, Kool G Rap, Brand Nubian, Chi-Ali, Ras Kass, Mic Geranimo, Bubba Sparxx and Rahsaan Patterson. His passion and commitment to succeed literally placed him on the \u201cRoad to the Riches\u201d. Early in his career, Fokis developed an online reality show based on his own experience as an independent hip hop artist seeking to secure a record deal within a year\u2019s time. Consistent with reality, the \u201cRoad to the Riches\u201d did not result in Fokis signing a record deal. Not deterred, Fokis went on to release several albums collaborating with various artists such as Joe Budden, Olu Dara (Nas\u2019 father), Deemi, Joell Ortiz and various producers such as Ty Fyffe, Focus\u2026(Aftermath Ent.) Fantom Of The Beat and Jake One. Fokis released various projects including the \u201c20/20\u201d EP exclusively produced by Focus of Aftermath \u201cRecognize Your Power\u201d EP with Edo. G & Shabaam Sahdeeq which was produced entirely by Fokis, \"This Thing Called Life\" which was produced by Oh No. all of which were well received by his fans.\n\nFokis has toured the United States and abroad, performed as an opening act for artists such as Common, Busta Rhymes, M.O.P., The Beatnuts, Onyx, Das Efx, Masta Ace and more. Through his experiences, Fokis developed a relevant broad appealing style and sound that remains true to the core foundational elements of Hip Hop with a commercial appeal. Though achieving success releasing his own music, Fokis realized in this era it would take more than pursuing a career as a recording artist to rise to the level of success he sought to achieve. As his experience with the business side of the industry grew, Fokis established his own independent record label, Loyalty Digital Corp. Through his label, Fokis has worked with and Executive produced projects like \u201cAn Ode To Reasonable Doubt\u201d by Skyzoo & Antman Wonder, \u201cBarrel Brothers\u201d by Skyzoo & Torae, \u201cNever Left\u201d by Sadat X and various others. Most recently, Fokis has created a membership based artist and producer collective called Local-Mu12. The members span from all over the world and are wrapping up their third LP for release this year. Fokis & Loyalty Digital\u2019s many achievements have been recognized by various blogs such as Complex, HipHopDX, NahRight, 2DopeBoyz, RapRadar, XXL and The Source to name a few.

Sandwiched between gatefold LPs, 12-inch singles, dub versions and white-labels was a reservoir of inspiration that he would draw on for the following decades. That was then. This is now. Since his college days, Bay Area-native Lyrics Born\u2019s raw, authentic talent has been polished to a gleaming beacon of originality in a time when it\u2019s needed most, and it\u2019s release marks a new era of label relations. \u201cThe old model is dead, you cant just put it out and expect people to get it\u201d, explains LB, and the statement could easily be applied to his sound or his approach to marketing the finished product.\n\nLyrics Born has gone about the creation of his latest effort, As U Were, in a less-than-conventional manner. One defining characteristic of his sound thus far has been that it can be described as unequivocally fun, and this remains true of As U Were. However, LB does routinely peel back the gregarious exterior to reveal a contemplative everyman, and it\u2019s times like this that his true artistry is apparent. \u201cIt\u2019s at the point in my career where I\u2019ve been through a lot, fun and not so fun. I think I\u2019m dealing with a lot issues that are more mature than the last few albums, from abandonment to betrayal to incredible joy\u201d. He voices these sentiments prominently on the lead single \u201cLies x 3\u201d, a driving, heartfelt plead for truth.\n\nWhile touching on newer subjects, he also reached out to artists that he felt removed himself from his comfort zone. \u201cThe new record is more synth-oriented. I made an effort to work with younger artists: Trackademicks, Francis and The Lights, and Sam Sparro, namely\u201d. The bay-swagger is in full effect on \u201cFunky Hit Records\u201d, and while the new guests add a new dimension to the sound, Tom Shimura isn\u2019t one to lose sight of his roots. Gift of Gab drops a requisite, thought-provoking verse on the critical \u201cPills\u201d and the classic Latyrx tag-team makes it look way too easy on \u201cPushed Aside, Pulled Apart\u201d, one of the album\u2019s standout cuts. As U Were may well be LB\u2019s greatest achievement, but it\u2019s been a long time coming.\n\nLyrics Born had been a music obsessive since his youth, and in 1993 freestyles among a group of UC Davis classmates that occupied the same cramped radio quarters began to find their way onto paper, and suddenly LB had written \u201cSend Them\u201d. It became the first single on the newly minted Solesides Records, a collaborative venture between himself and his accomplices who would later go on to be known internationally as Blackalicious (comprised of MC Gift of Gab and producer Chief Xcel), DJ Shadow and Lateef The Truthspeaker, an East Oakland rapper with whom he found a shared affinity for the rapid-fire lyrical volleys that would define the next step. As Latyrx (a combination of their working names) the two MCs released The Album, in 1997. The LP would go on to become a certified classic, selling 100,000 copies, yet would prove to be the tip of an even larger iceberg.\n\nSolesides was re-imagined as Quannum Projects in 1999. As co-owner, LB used Quannum as a conduit through which he delivered his most realized project to date, 2003\u2019s Later That Day. The album yielded his biggest commercial success to date, \u201cCallin\u2019 Out\u201d, which charted nationally and was featured in several major motion pictures, EA Sports games as well as a Diet Coke spot featuring Adrian Brody. The remix LP, Same !@#$ Different Day was released shortly after, showcasing the talents of his closest associates and as well as new material. Meanwhile, Lyrics Born began to explore different means of engaging listeners. He kept fans abreast of his work by peppering the internet with The Lyrics Born Variety Show mixtape series which he released himself through his website. The mixtapes, as well as ceaseless touring and the creation of his own internet media outlets Lyrics Born TV and LBFM, were elements of a new formula.\n\nSince the release of Later That Day, Lyrics Born has averaged over 150 shows a year, and his explosive live energy was captured on the disc Overnite Encore, a compilation of live performances with live musicians from the Australian leg of his 2006 world tour. He followed up in 2008 with Everywhere At Once, a varied studio disk that signaled a departure from the sample-based pieces he had become known for, supplementing the sound with a full band and a healthy dose of synthesizers. Hence, he has arrived at well-rounded sound that is classic and yet futuristic. Tom Shimura hasn\u2019t forgotten how he got here, but he\u2019s never been afraid to look to the future, either.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sik-K ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617767.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joe Flizzow ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Raiden ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6646721.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Drum, Bass, Metalcore, Electronic, Metal", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Our first self titled EP AVAILIABLE ON BANDCAMP FREE for Download! raidenofficial.bandcamp.com Booking: raidenbooking@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Vanness Wu ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "MILCK ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8473669.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Pop Cinematic Soul", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "I sing for the relentless, the vulnerable, and the brave.

Thile had set himself a formidable musical challenge and, as befits this enthusiastically risk-embracing artist, he was more than up to the task. In addition to traveling, planning, rehearsing, and performing on the fifteen episodes of APHC\u2019s 2016\u201317 season, Thile managed each week to create a funny, topical, and at times quite poignant new song he would play with a rotating cast of APHC band-mates and guest stars. These were not throwaway radio bits, but smart, fully realized compositions. They served the needs of the show but were just as timely and engaging on their own.\n\nIn July 2017, Thile went into New York City\u2019s Reservoir Studios with producer and longtime friend Thomas Bartlett and that\u2019s when these songs gained an even deeper resonance. As they listened through the APHC versions, Thile and Bartlett realized that, taken together, these songs could form an album-length narrative. Part of the story Thile found was autobiographical. Thanks for Listening represents perhaps the most direct and personal material Thile has ever recorded. It reflects the changes to his own peripatetic life as he assumes a new role as APHC host and, behind the scenes, as a new dad\u2014while continuing to play with his band Punch Brothers and collaborate with such artists as Brad Mehldau, Edgar Meyer, and Yo-Yo Ma. We learn what delights him (like the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series,) and what alarms him (the polarized state of our nation post-election). But Thile also tells a broader tale\u2014satirically, wistfully, frankly\u2014 about the divisions and disconnects plaguing America today, whether it\u2019s on social media or at the Thanksgiving table. The overarching theme, Thile realized, was about the art of listening\u2014the joys of it, the current difficulties of it, and the necessity of hearing what others have to say, not just the overwhelming desire to be heard.\n\nListening, or the lack thereof, figures prominently on several tracks: \u201cFeedback Loop\u201d lampoons the way social media filters out all but those one agrees with, while \u201cModern Friendship\u201d rues the way old pals can drift apart\u2014and suggests that maybe sharing a well-made night cap could help solve that. \u201cStanley Ann\u201d is a graceful imagining of what Barack Obama might have said to his late mom as he departed the White House in January. The deceptively cheerful \u201cFalsetto,\u201d on the other hand, is an all-too-kind speculation on how the current occupant of the White House might gracelessly scold an activist entertainer\u2014managing to insult the singer\u2019s \u201cgirly falsetto\u201d in the process.\n\n\u201cMy initial working title was Get It out on the Radio\u201d (the name of the song he performs at the end of each APHC episode). But the album pivoted away from the show and toward the listeners\u2014and not just to the listeners of Prairie Home but to anyone who listens to things. They are my heroes\u2014people who listen. I find myself all too often on the other side of the conversation, talking about what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s hard to maintain focus or give something enough attention to appreciate it. We\u2019re in a place where listening is a precious commodity. That\u2019s the theme that I noticed rising up, greater than \u2018here is what was happening last week\u2019 or \u2018here is the place we were.\u2019 It\u2019s a celebration of people who haven\u2019t switched off, despite being given every reason to do so.\u201d\n\nThe arrangements have an intimate, dream-like quality to them; the songs feel like reveries, not statements. Thile\u2019s voice is at times double- or triple-tracked, cossetted by subtle echo. He delivers vocal takes that are by turns wry and soulful, frequently deploying a lovely falsetto in an especially evocative way, more Beach Boys than bluegrass. The chorus of \u201cThank You, New York,\u201d performed with singer Gaby Moreno, is a vocal stand-out, a nose-thumbing good riddance to the turbulent year that was 2016 (and a nod to the resilience of New York City and its occupants). Thile\u2019s mandolin playing remains front and center\u2014and it the sole instrument on \u201cBalboa\u201d \u2014but it is often bolstered by Bartlett\u2019s subtle, slightly mysterious, layering of keyboards and electronics.\n\n\u201cI was deeply desirous of a record that sounded like it was coming from your own head. That\u2019s where we veered away from a more archival studio approach\u2014where you go in, perform the songs, and record exactly how those performances sounded,\u201d Thile says. \u201cThe recordings on Thank You for Listening are more fanciful in construction.\n\n\u201cOftentimes I would be at the big room of Reservoir Studios making maps of these songs with whatever stringed instruments seemed appropriate and singing scratch vocals. Then Thomas would take them into his little room and start experimenting on them. And I would start the next map,\u201d he continues. \u201cI would get my pass by having written the song and having created a keep-able demo of the song and then Thomas would get his pass without me looking over his shoulder, telling him \u2018that\u2019s not how it goes.\u2019 Which I\u2019m unable to not do if I\u2019m in the room. It was like an editor editing a novel.\u201d\n\nLike Thile, multi-instrumentalist Bartlett is a musical polymath, comfortable in diverse collaborative situations. He often sits in with the National; he plays piano in the Irish Music group The Gloaming; and he occasionally performs on his own under the Doveman moniker. Rather than enlisting a full APHC-style band in the studio, the pair conceived the project largely as a musical dialogue between them\u2014a listening session of their own, if you will.\n\nThile manned all the stringed instruments, save for bass (from Alan Hampton) and viola (from Nadia Sirota, on the title track). Ted Poor\u2014like Hampton, a member of Andrew Bird\u2019s touring band\u2014played drums on five tracks. Bartlett provided, in Thile\u2019s words, \u201cwhatever sounds weren\u2019t accounted for.\u201d Thile also invited three guest singers to the sessions, all of whom had performed multiple times on APHC: Sarah Jarosz, Gaby Mereno, and Aoife O\u2019 Donovan. He says, \u201cAll three had made really meaningful contributions to how the songs ended up expressing themselves. That goes for all the musicians who played on this last APHC season. They all made such meaningful contributions to these songs. I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d\n\nThe original \u201cSong of the Week\u201d versions can be easily accessed via YouTube, now that all the APHC shows are live-streamed and subsequently archived. The performances are full of personality and humor, as Thile, a dependably energetic live performer, interacts with a roster of players that include various Punch Brothers, brilliant guitarist Julian Lage, and Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek. Contrasting these versions with the new studio recordings, one can appreciate the sort of magical transformation that took place at Reservoir Studios, one that was more about inspiration than analysis.\n\nThe process effected a transformation on Thile too: \u201cBefore hosting Prairie Home, I would listen to music much the way an athlete trains. Listening was like hitting the gym, like a pitcher strengthening his rotator cuff. I was listening to improve specific aspects of my musicianship or nourish it in specific ways. The hosting has brought me back into being a music lover, just listening with the idea of enjoying the three to five minutes of a performance, not worrying about whether it\u2019s rendering my sense of counterpoint more sophisticated or increasing my knowledge of how sonata form works or giving me more arrows in my improvisational quiver.\u201d He continues, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u2018do I like this? Is my life better since listening to this song?\u2019 That\u2019s what I care about now.\n\n\u201cI think that development led me to ask Thomas to produce Thanks for Listening,\u201d Thile concludes. \u201cHe and I have stayed up late drinking Amaro and listening to records. I often hold vast amounts of myself back to analyze things and Thomas would consistently play me things that would disarm that side of me.

It was a bit of good luck.\u201d\n\nThese grainy, absorbing images play over the exhilarating whirl of \u201cDivebomber\u201d, a song inspired by the World War II film of the same name, and one of several on his new album that evoke a sensation of sharp ascent, of giddy height, the free-fall thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rush, if you fly fast enough. With a rush of blood, you can bet you forget everyone.\u201d\n\nFinn did not set out on his third solo album with a theme in mind. But by the time he came to call it after another track on the record, \u201cDizzy Heights\u201d, it had become inescapable. \u201cIt crept up on me. I started noticing it in lots of places.\n\n\u201cYou start off with a number of different threads and angles and demos, and they dictate the terms of the record. It\u2019s only in the course of the process that you maybe get a feeling there\u2019s a type of song emerging, or an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe cloud jumpers epitomise, too, the Finn creative process: an attachment to a work-ethic and prosaic rigour - \u201ca willingness to be disciplined, punctual and focused\u201d \u2013 but designed for the arrival of something more, \u201cto capture the little flashes of complete happenstance or good fortune that come your way \u2013 often from a mistake\u201d.\n\nAn indirect inspiration for the height motif is mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953, five years before Neil was born. \u201cHilary had a huge impact on my generation of New Zealanders,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the New Zealand DNA about trying to scale impossible heights. It\u2019s something that can be very positive, but also has its downside.\u201d\n\nAmid its vertiginous, richly melodic swirl, Dizzy Heights contemplates love (\u201cBetter than TV\u201d), loss (\u201cFlying in the Face of Love\u201d), ageing (\u201cRecluse\u201d) and allure (\u201cLights of New York\u201d). It peeks, too - in \u201cIn My Blood\u201d, for example - into the abyss.\n\nNeil Finn was 18 when he was invited by his older brother Tim to join the trailblazing art rock band Split Enz. His career since might be measured as a series of bounds, the best-known being Crowded House, which he founded with Paul Hester and Nick Seymour after the breakup of Split Enz in 1984. Four albums, among them Crowded House and Together Alone, brought the group popular and critical acclaim around the world.\n\nAlong the way, there have been a host of collaborations, including with brother Tim and wife Sharon, and an array of names from Johnny Marr, Ed O\u2019Brien, Eddie Vedder and most of Wilco. There have been two solo records, Try Whistling This and One Nil (or One All). And yet Dizzy Heights unmistakably marks a fresh leap.\n\nWith wife Sharon (bass) and sons Liam (guitar) and Elroy (drums), Finn travelled in two bursts to producer Dave Fridmann\u2019s Tarbox Road studio in upstate New York, to record songs composed at his Auckland studio, Roundhead. With Fridmann (Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips), and in collaborations with young New Zealand musicians Connan Mockasin and SJD, Finn has assembled a textured, heady sound, furnished and elevated by woozy strings and soaring vocals.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it a solo record in a stripped back singer-songwriter sort of way,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI had a feeling Dave would be good at adding some odd shapes to the music. Which I always welcome \u2013 making things a little more expansive ... He is good at subverting things, and making things sound a bit messed up and not as obvious, rather than being too tasteful, which is always a temptation.\u201d\n\nFinn remembers an important English teacher, from four decades ago at his high school in Te Awamutu, a small rural town in New Zealand\u2019s north island. His name was Ron Martin, and he raced them through the School Certificate syllabus in a matter of weeks, to clear space for reading, writing, arguing, making films (\u201cHe [later] gave me a Super-8 movie I\u2019d made in his class, and I\u2019d done a kind of dramatised version of the song \u2018Aqualung\u2019 by Jethro Tull ... I was dressed as a tramp with an old coat\u201d).\n\nSays Finn: \u201cWe had a very spirited debate one day in class about whether having big aspirations, big dreams, was a good idea given it can ultimately lead to disillusionment and isolation and at worst bitterness. There was quite a lot of variance of opinion, and I definitely came out for the, yeah, you\u2019ve got to have the big dreams and big aspirations and it doesn\u2019t matter, what the hell.\n\n\u201cI think of that sometimes when ambition, or having big dreams, seems slightly shallow and vain. Because the motivations they shift \u2013 imperceptibly sometimes ...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like those boys, jumping off that cliff. I keep thinking back to the one who runs to the edge and stops twice, before leaping off. Life carries on being like that.\u201d\n\n- TOBY MANHIRE", "otherInfo": "Neil Finn is back for more Fangradio live audio streams on Mixlr, Tuesdays and Saturdays at 3pm PT.\n\n\"Tuesday will be broadcast from my place, more or less solo.

In the powerful track \"You Won't See Me Again,\" co-written by Andrew Copeland, singer and guitarist for the band, he addresses heartbreaking emotions and distress about his own brother-in-law's fight with alcohol addiction. The emotional delivery of the lyrics by lead vocalist Ken Block came easily and honestly as he is in his 15th year of recovery from alcohol and drug addiction.

In adolescence and youth, nightclub listeners of heavy metal bands, Iron Maiden and Megadeth, their main influences. F\u00e1bio also liked to draw, and he painted t-shirts with drawings of the covers of the discs. Perhaps he has inherited his artistic vein from his family since he has been a movie actor in Europe, his best style of violin playing and making woodwork and his mother very much like to paint paintings. He is also a sports lover like Surf and in 1986 decided to create a fashion wave and express his art on t-shirts. He became a fashion designer, a designer brand, and produced fashion shows at renowned venues such as the Victoria Pub located in a neighborhood of the City of S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1991, he moved to the City of Mogi das Cruzes, where he made some visits, \"Surf Shops\" that sold his products. Continued to produce fashion shows and other events with rock bands and other styles, we can cite a landmark event in the City that was produced with the reggae band Cidade Negra. In 1995, he returned to meet the music and decided the school. Six years after his studies, he created a first rock band titled \"Brave Heart\", his ex-wife and brother also joined the band, played songs and some covers of Megadeth, Black Sabath, among others. They even came up with a small EP, but nothing professional. They did some parties in bars and schools of region, but in 1997, the pair of musicians embarked for Japan, where also they presented new songs like songs but without any performances. In 1998, when returning to Brazil, F\u00e1bio started to teach driums lessons in two schools in S\u00e3o Paulo. He returned to Japan even more than 3 times later. After a period of travel and learning, only year 2007 again formed a new band, this time with the name of \"Surfer of Christ\". An idea of ??the name came from the sport he practiced, surf, and \"Christ\", for he became a follower of Jesus' teachings.The band was a mix of rock and reggae and lasted about 2 years, recording only a single demo with five tracks and performed in some public places, squares, events and in public schools and churches of the region of S\u00e3o Paulo and Greater S\u00e3o Paulo . As F\u00e1bio was always fond of the Heavy Metal style, due to his influences, in 2009 he formed the band called \"No Thanxs\". They recorded a single and two CDs, taking on good projections due to the highlight of the remarkable, heavy riffs and inspiring lyrics of the songs. The band made small and large presentations in S\u00e3o Paulo and other cities, among them we can mention the opening of the show by the former vocalist of rock band Raimundos, Rodolfo Abrantes. \"No Thanxs\" participated in interviews on radios, newspapers and some local television channels. In 2012, F\u00e1bio announces the end of the band, for personal reasons and incompatibility of ideas. That same year, he traveled to the United States to improve his English skills and also to do a theological study at the Dunamis Resource Center led by Pr. Dennis Walker and Israel Silva. In February of 2013, he returned to Brazil and began a new stage in his career as guitarist and vocalist of a solo project titled \"Jesus Freack Rock\" starting the new compositions. All songs are of their own making, mostly written in English and Portuguese, because English is a universal language, and are based on the Holy Bible and also on true facts and themes of current reality. The presentations are enhanced in shows, festivals, churches, schools and events in general with the goal of bringing the true message of the gospel to the knowledge of people, whether Christian or not, emphasizing freedom, without religious dogmas and doctrines, nor created standards by some leaders. At the end of the year 2013, he returned to the United States for another season of presentations and divulgation of his new work. Touring the Cities of Las Vegas and Henderson and among some famous places, we can mention: - Mega Store Samash Music - Money Plays - BB's Club House, where he performed at the event in commemoration of US veterans with the special participation of ex- guitarist of thrash metal band Megadeth, Jeff Young. He then traveled to Mexico City to perform at the Veracruzano Social and Cultural Center at La Caverna Rock Bar. Upon returning to Brazil in 2014, the project was renamed \"Jesushed\", a more original name with a profound meaning : \"Jesus Shed.\" In 2015, he released the CD Born Again, in 2017 the EP 360 and in October 2018 the EP \"End Times\", that is currently on tour.Since 2016 \"Jesushed\" had 3 different line up, and currently has the following members: F\u00e1bio Curtis - Vocal and Guitar, Wellington Ferreira - lead guitar, Maicon Martins - Bass and Jos\u00e9 Carlos - Drums.", "otherInfo": "Release of new track called Brasil, sistema falido."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tara Brooks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9491300.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Cordial Sins ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9385919.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Alternative, Shoegaze, Indie Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Cordial Sins are drawing fervent attention for their delectable meld of alternative, shoegaze and pop, having recently completed their first U.S. tour in support of Elvis Depressedly.

Perhaps the greatest element of David Guetta\u2019s illustrious story is not simply his countless personal successes, but his wider game-changing approach. From making dance music and DJ culture more of a viable and legitimised commercial success than ever before to finally uniting the worlds of electronic and urban music, the repercussions of his visionary attitude cannot be underestimated.\n\nDavid has established himself as arguably the world\u2019s biggest and most successful DJ of all time by fusing dance music with urban artists. By teaming up with some of the biggest names in hip hop and R&B, and reinventing their sound for the electronic dancefloors, Guetta created pop alchemy. The ensuing hits such as \u2018I Gotta Feeling\u2019 with Black Eyed Peas, \u2018When Love Takes Over\u2019 with Kelly Rowland and \u2018Sexy Bitch\u2019 with Akon propelled him to superstardom. They also set a new template for the sound of commercial radio. This was instrumental in turning electronic music into the biggest youth movement since hip hop.\n\nOf course, his own groundbreaking accomplishments cannot be overlooked either. 50 million album and single sales; over 10 billion YouTube and Spotify plays; numerous #1 singles and Platinum and Gold certifications across the globe; two Grammys for Best Remixed Recording and four further nominations; one of the most successful club nights Ibiza has ever seen; one of the biggest social media followings of any DJ/producer; the first DJ to be on the cover of Billboard, the list goes on and on and on\u2026\n\nWith all his success as a chart-topping producer, it\u2019s all too easy to forget about his hallowed heritage as a highly respected DJ. Promoting raves in his native Paris with nothing more than photocopied flyers, he rose through the influential \u2018French touch\u2019 era that saw the likes of Daft Punk come to fame, but was soon forging his own path through the dance music scene. Whether he\u2019s playing at one of his residencies at XS and Encore in Las Vegas or Ushua\u00efa Ibiza or playing mega festivals like Tomorrowland (where he has performed since its first year) and Ultra Music Festival, he never forgets those humble roots. His \u2018classical\u2019 training in the art of mixing combined with his enduring appeal and continual relevancy ensured him the #6 spot on the DJ Mag Top 100 and a Billboard award for Top Dance/Electronic artist most recently.\n\nCiting his role in the studio in the vein of a classic producer, Guetta sits as the musical brain at the center of the project, bringing it all together. His incredible list of collaborators over the years has included Madonna, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, Usher, Sia, John Legend, Nicki Minaj, Kelly Rowland, Showtek, Avicii, Ne-Yo, Akon, Afrojack and Nicky Romero for starters, but he has also been a keen supporter of lesser-known talent. The likes of Sam Martin and Chris Willis have both enjoyed continual support from Guetta, showing that he\u2019s not just about the A-listers but also about championing hot new names. \u201cOf course it\u2019s amazing to work with famous people,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut the reason behind their fame is their talent. But I also love finding talented people who are not famous, it\u2019s equally amazing to put the spotlight on them.\u201d\n\nAlways in high demand outside of the clubs, festivals and studios, Guetta\u2019s extra-curricular activities have ranged from providing the original soundtrack and musical direction for the UEFA Euro 2016 football championship to being a key partner for UNICEF and an early supporter of groundbreaking legal mix uploading platform Dubset. Never hesitating to help charities, David joined forces with the United Nations in support of \u2018\u2019The World Needs More\u2019\u2019 campaign to raise funds for humanitarian emergencies.\n\nOne of his latest releases Would I Lie To You is seeing him return to the club dancefloors, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019ll never be defined by just one side of his career. His passion for music remains undying, and while the world continues to watch his every move with anticipation, he\u2019ll ignore the pressure and continue his ongoing search for that perfect beat.\n\nHis latest release Shed A Light is a dance pop ballad that is bound to leave a lasting impression across the globe. The track shot to the charts and has reached a Golden status in Italy, The Netherlands and Sweden up until now. More than anything the deeply moving song sends a message of hope, urging us to heed the call of our hearts. The track has the emotional fire that Guetta aims for in all his productions.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Possessed by Paul James ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8546259.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Konrad Wert", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Fans of singer/songwriter and one man band Possessed By Paul James my be surprised to find out that playing music is not his only passion.

Taught to play and read music by his mother, Joe started taking formal piano lessons at the age of nine. RONNIE VAN ZANDT, OTIS REDDING, PHIL ANSELMO and ZAKK WYLDE are among his favorite singers. Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011. Elephant Mountain has just recorded their new album and will be releasing it Spring/Summer of 2013. He's lent his vocal expertise to many local releases, and appears on MUSHROOMHEAD\u2019s album, \u201cBeautiful Stories For Ugly Children\u201d, singing on the track \u201cHoles In The Void\u201d\n\nAnd not to be outdone Joe has released three cd\u2019s of original material, \u201cJUST JOE SOLO EP\u201d (December 2011), \u201cMy Demons, My Burden, My Life\u201d (May of 2012) and \u201cGot Joe?\u201d (December of 2012).

Summoning a thrilling spirit, with throwback sonic crunch, visual flair, and reckless live performances, PALAYE ROYALE has quickly earned a legion of obsessive cult-like loyalists, lovingly dubbed Soldiers of the Royal Council. PALAYE ROYALE draw as much inspiration from cinema and philosophy as they do from their musical muses, building a story with libertine reverence for Alan Watts and debauchery-fueled nights at the Chateau Marmont, for Johnny Thunders and The Stooges. This band is equally at home in the hallways of Los Angeles Fashion Week or climbing the lighting tresses at the Vans Warped Tour. They sold out theaters on their first-ever headlining tour and steal the show at each major festival.\nEach member of PALAYE ROYALE doubles as musician and visionary. The Pirate, The Vampire, and The Gentleman inspire a level of devotion reserved for My Chemical Romance or Twenty One Pilots, as their deep fan connection crosses genre-divides.\nKerrang! declared the band to be \u201con the cusp of next-level stardom\u201d and with good reason. PAYALE ROYALE went from support act on any tour that would have them to the cover of Rock Sound and Alternative Press. \u201cMorning Light,\u201d \u201cMr. Doctor Man,\u201d \u201cGet Higher,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Feel Quite Right,\u201d and \u201cMa Ch\u00e9rie\u201d amassed 30 million YouTube views (and counting). Boom Boom Room (Side A) paved the way for this year\u2019s hotly- anticipated follow-up, Boom Boom Room (Side B), heralded by the arrival of the overnight smash lead single, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Fine.\u201d PALAYE ROYALE brought the juxtaposition of the glitz and grime of their teenage years spent in Las Vegas, when they relocated to Los Angeles in 2011. The ghost of Charlie Chaplin was surely some sort of unseen guide as they took up residence in his old home and rehearsed continuously in a basement. By the time they hit the road, borrowing their mother\u2019s Cadillac Escalade, Remington Leith, Sebastian Danzig, and Emerson Barrett were a tightly wound creative force. (Not long ago, they slept in that SUV outside a Motel 6, unable to afford to rent a room.)\nIt was Alex Burdon, daughter of The Animals singer Eric Burdon, who insisted Sumerian\u2019s founder see the band. (The label offered them a contract the same night.) Los Angeles radio personality and tastemaker Rodney Bingenheimer introduced PALAYE ROYALE to rock industry legend Kim Fowley, another strong supporter. James Iha of The Smashing Pumpkins/A Perfect Circle and Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour also count themselves among the band\u2019s true believers, having worked with them as a producer and taken them out on tour, respectively. Sleeping With Sirens\u2019 Kellin Quinn made a guest appearance on Boom Boom Room (Side A). As their moniker itself evokes (Palaye Royale is the name of the Toronto dancehall where their grandparents met in the \u201850s), the brotherly trio is eager to connect themselves and this generation to the spirit of the past, but reinvigorated for today with eclecticism and fierce individuality. Their tours are like a traveling circus. Clad in scarves, hats, paisley shirts, and makeup, as the Soldiers of the Royal Council attest, it\u2019s the PALAYE ROYALE lifestyle. Gretsch guitar tones that shimmer with reverb, drums that shake and pound, vocals that claw forth with the electric urgency of the early punk movement, all swirling together with the swinging cool of the 1960s and the swagger of latter day Brit Pop bands such as The Libertines and early Arctic Monkeys. Each show comes with an element of unpredictability and danger, with the three guys playing as if their lives depended on it, pure showmanship over perfectionism.\nAs Classic Rock Magazine wrote, \u201cIf you want theatrics, these boys deliver in spades \u2013 and not just in their headline-grabbing threads and eye-popping stage show.\u201d The Rolling Stones, The Black Crowes, and The Doors collide with The Ramones and Iggy Pop within their songs, with a hint of the early blues that inspired Led Zeppelin. It\u2019s fast-paced dirty rock n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s glam and grime, spectacle and sweat, showmanship and songwriting. Rock Sound\u2019s in-depth cover story, drawn from an intense 72-hours with the brothers, called PALAYE ROYALE \u201cRock\u2019s Next Superstars,\u201d predicting they \u201cmight just change it all.\u201d Even as 2016\u2019s Boom Boom Room (Side A) and 2018\u2019s Boom Boom Room (Side B) document the story thus far, PALAYE ROYALE remain focused on the bigger picture. They\u2019ve built something grander than a band. It\u2019s an artistic movement. Ever self- assured in their ambition and staunch in their support of individuality, PALAYE ROYALE are \u201coutfitting the revolution\u201d (as they like to say).", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Larkin Poe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10314954.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Country, Alternative Rock, Country Blues, Roots Rock, Blues-rock, Blues, Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Our new album SELF MADE MAN will be out on June 12!

During a career spanning three decades he has not only injected every inch of his being into the music industry, traveling the length and breadth of the planet to spread his gospel, but he has also been responsible for setting up some of the most prominent platforms in the business and kickstarting the careers of numerous international stars. DJ T. has an unsurpassed depth of knowledge, an unrelenting passion for discovering and nurturing new talent and unflinching determination, which has been the catalyst behind a hugely influential career lasting over 25 years and counting\u2026\n\nBorn in Dusseldorf, DJ T. (real name Thomas Koch), relocated to Frankfurt with his family in the late 70s. During his formative years, he fell for the hypnotic grooves of disco, inspired by his parents\u2019 record collection. At the age of nine he was already completely enraptured by music and that love affair continues until this very day. He began an obsessive quest to collect music, feeding his soul with everything from disco and hi-nrg, through to early hip-hop and electro, soul, funk and R\u2019n\u2019B. The groovy, infectious rhythms of all those genres continue to permeate into the music he makes and plays today, providing an intrinsic part of his sound ethic.\n\nAround this time he took up breakdancing, compelled by the energy of hip-hop and early electro pioneers to push himself physically, channelling the energy of true body music, which remains part of his musical DNA. From body-popping and locking, he progressed into DJing, a discipline through which he could share his undying passion for music. T. started to play at private parties in his hometown, soon picking up his first professional gigs. The late eighties proved to be a pivotal moment in his life as acid house swept through Europe, landing in Frankfurt and taking over with the launch of Sven V\u00e4th\u2019s legendary Omen club in 1988. The first wave of house and techno took hold and T. was there at the forefront, absorbing all the fresh new sounds from Chicago, Detroit and the UK. He picked up a residency at the infamous Music Hall and held residencies at countless clubs across the city during the next 10 years from Plastik and Dorian Gray to The Box. During this fertile period, DJ T. established himself as a reputable purveyor of electronic music and, by the end of the nineties, he was one of Frankfurt\u2019s best-known selectors.\n\nIn 1989 DJ T. tapped into another side of his creative energy to set up Groove Magazine. Identifying a gap in the market and fuelled by a need to satisfy his own desire for specialised music journalism, which focused on his interests \u2013 namely, underground dance music. Under his leadership the magazine was launched into the public\u2019s consciousness and he guided Groove to become one of Germany\u2019s premier dance music publications, which it still is today. He served as editor and publisher for 15 years and took the brand on the road with numerous tours and club events in and around Germany, not only on the road but across the airwaves with a weekly radio show.\n\nAfter a decade of events under the Groove banner, DJ T:injected all of his experience into the launch of his own venue. In 1999 he teamed up with a friend, Patrik Dechent, to open his own intimate club space, Monza. Over the next five years his creative vision and unique music programming kept the club buoyant and even spawned an Ibiza franchise; presenting the very best house music to a discerning, open-minded crowd. DJ T.\u2019s ambitions pushed him forward into yet another successful venture in 2002 when he collaborated with five friends to set up Get Physical, a seminal label which has received universal respect since its conception and has been responsible for launching the careers of a long list of global stars. Though he left in 2010, T. still A&Rs for the label, lending his remarkable ear to the continued success of the label.\n\nAs well as DJing, event organisation, journalism, club ownership, A&Ring and label management, T. has also produced an impressive catalogue of releases; both singles and albums, which demonstrate his ability to create a diverse range of sounds, drawing on his extensive experience of collecting and playing music. In the early stages of his production career, from debut EP, \u2018Monsterbaze\u2019, with Steve Bug in 2000, to his first album \u2018Boogie Playground\u2019 in 2005, DJ T. was injecting all the music he was surrounded by in his formative years into creating hypnotic house grooves, With three albums under his belt, he has proven time and again that he can make body music with soul, unleashing deep enchanting rhythms influenced by a wide range of genres. On his most recent album, T. partnered up with Stefan Eichinger (aka LOPAZZ) to create a long-player that explored his songwriting capabilities and allowed him to expand his creative boundaries. Entitled \u2018Pleasure Principle\u2019, it remains one of his most seminal projects to date and spawned a hugely popular series of remix EPs, featuring contributions from the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of contemporary house and techno including Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Tale Of Us, Art Department and Jamie Jones & Lee Foss. DJ T. himself has also become synonymous with remixes, putting out numerous reworks for an array of artists and labels over the last decade.\n\nBeyond the production work, DJ T. has also been responsible for curating several key compilations over the years. In 2006 he released his debut commercial mix \u2018Body Language Vol.2\u2019, followed by \u2018fabric 51\u2019 in 2010, \u2018United Under The Ball \u2013 30 Years Of Disco\u2019 in 2011 and \u2018The House That Jack Built Vol 1 & 2\u2019 in 2012. In 2013 he celebrated 25 years of DJing with a very personal mix compilation, followed also by \u2018Body Language 15\u2019 and a collaboration with Defected and Strictly Rhythm to celebrate the latter\u2019s 25th anniversary. DJ T.\u2019s reputation for being a master selector has been cemented by these superlative collections of music, each of which has received widespread praise, often featuring many of T.\u2019s own edits of classic tracks.\n\nNow almost 30 years deep, with an extraordinary list of achievements behind him, T. shows no signs of slowing down, in fact his unrelenting drive and thirst for seeking out new avenues has led to several key changes in his circumstances recently. In 2015 T.\u2019s output has hit previously unexplored terrains, with music landing on labels such as AUS Music and Moon Harbour. Turning once again to his Chicago and jacking house roots, T.\u2019s latest tracks blend the old school styles with a modern sound ethic, focused around contemporary tech house and the dark and ravy sounds emanating out of the UK underground. In unison with new production partner Emanuel Satie - a talented newcomer from Frankfurt who now resides in Berlin.\n\nTwo years after he celebrated 25 years in the business with a world tour and numerous projects connected to the milestone event, DJ T. remains as enthusiastic about music as he was in his formative years. Creativity is at a high, his desire to spread music far and wide never wains and his artistry and dynamism as a DJ is unparalleled.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Stephen Lewis ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/288391.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "On Saturday, May 30th and Sunday, May 31st fans of the festival can tune in to \u201cThe Best of Mountain Jam\u201d for a full day of Mountain Jam performances and backstage artist interviews.\nSaturday 5/30\n7:00pm ET - Stephen Lewis and the Big Band of Fun\n7:45pm ET - Michael Franti\n8:00pm ET - Warren Haynes\n8:15pm ET - Levon\u2019s 70th Birthday Jubilee (from Mountain Jam 2010)"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tim Baker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8969941.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Techno, Electronic", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tim Baker is best known as the writer and frontman of the much-acclaimed Newfoundland group, Hey Rosetta!.

Francisco Javier Barraza Rodr\u00edguez, a quien todo el mundo conoce como Pancho Barraza, es originario de Juan Jos\u00e9 R\u00edos, Sinaloa. Desde muy peque\u00f1o mostr\u00f3 una gran inclinaci\u00f3n hacia la m\u00fasica, aunque al principio casi nadie cre\u00eda en \u00e9l. Fue hasta la edad de 22 a\u00f1os, mientras era maestro de m\u00fasica en la secundaria del poblado de Villa Uni\u00f3n, que se inicia de manera profesional al formar parte del grupo vers\u00e1til Karisma como vocalista y bajista. Al mismo tiempo, integra el coro de la iglesia del pueblo. Al poco tiempo, su talento y don para componer, lo llevan a la banda Los Recoditos, donde lo designan como su voz principal logrando destacar con sus propias canciones. Adem\u00e1s, se convierte en el creador del estilo rom\u00e1ntico en la m\u00fasica de banda y es as\u00ed que Recoditos empieza a sonar en las radios del Pac\u00edfico gracias a los temas de Pancho. Es tanta su inquietud por crear y la confianza que se tiene como cantante, compositor y m\u00fasico que en 1995 se separa de Los Recoditos para lanzarse como solista y forma su propia banda. La bautiza con el nombre de \u2018Santa Mar\u00eda\u2019. De ah\u00ed en adelante, los nombres de Pancho Barraza y su banda Santa Mar\u00eda empiezan a escucharse con gran insistencia por todo el Pac\u00edfico y parte de Estados Unidos con temas como \u201cMis Canciones De Amor\u201d, \u201cIgnorarte Mis L\u00e1grimas\u201d, \u201cGabriela De Mis Amores\u201d, \u201cPasi\u00f3n De Amor\u201d y \u201cSanta Mar\u00eda Banda\u201d. Todos estos \u00e9xitos vienen incluidos en su primera producci\u00f3n como solista titulada \u201cMis Canciones De Amor\u201d. En abril del 96, lanza su segundo disco compacto titulado \u201cCuenta Conmigo\u201d, del que destacan canciones como \u201cMi Amor Y Mi Agon\u00eda\u201d, \u201cUna Tarde Como Cualquiera\u201d, la titular \u201cCuenta Conmigo\u201d, \u201cTe Amo Y Te Lo Digo\u201d y otras. Es tanta su capacidad musical, que al a\u00f1o siguiente decide incursionar en la m\u00fasica ranchera. Forma su mariachi Santa Mar\u00eda y graba el \u00e1lbum \u201cInv\u00e9ntame Un Amor\u201d, del que se desprenden los \u00e9xitos \u201cPero La Recuerdo\u201d, \u201cSolitario Entre La Gente\u201d y \u201cCantares De Medianoche\u201d. Tanta fue la aceptaci\u00f3n que tuvo Pancho Barraza con este disco que los lugares donde se presentaba siempre estaban llenos a reventar, por lo que merecidamente se gan\u00f3 el titulo de \u201c\u00eddolo de las multitudes\u201d. En 1998, se convierte en \u201cEl Vagabundo Que Te Ama\u201d y con \u00e9ste, que fue su nuevo CD, lanza un nuevo hit a ritmo de banda: \u201cMi Enemigo El Amor\u201d, y uno m\u00e1s a ritmo de cumbia: \u201cAquella Morena\u201d. Adem\u00e1s, por primera vez graba un corrido: \u201cHistoria De Amores\u201d. En junio de 1999, vuelve a sorprender con su producci\u00f3n titulada \u201cDel Camino A La Ciudad\u201d, un disco lleno de inspiraci\u00f3n y nostalgia por los momentos dificiles que pasa cualquier ser humano. De este nuevo trabajo musical se desprenden 12 temas en los que Pancho muestra su madurez art\u00edstica y humana, ya que incursiona al mismo tiempo en g\u00e9neros como la salsa, el bolero, la balada y la cumbia. \u201cYa Se Fue\u201d es el disco que el \u2018\u00eddolo de las multitudes\u2019 lanza para comenzar el a\u00f1o 2000. Por primera vez en su exitosa carrera incluye temas de otros autores. Pero les imprime su muy peculiar estilo interpretativo como es el caso de \u201cUn Indio Quiere Llorar\u201d, \u201cMi Juramento\u201d, \u201cAy Amigo\u201d, y \u201cLas Rejas No Matan\u201d, entre otros. \u201cYa Se Fue\u201d tambi\u00e9n cuenta con temas de su propia inspiraci\u00f3n, como \u201cCompa\u00f1era M\u00eda\u201d, \u201cLola La Bailera\u201d, \u201cNo Va A Matarme Tu Amor\u201d y \u201cLa Vaca Pinta\u201d. Para finales de ese mismo a\u00f1o, saca \u201cUna Noche Cualquiera\u201d una producci\u00f3n musical en la que vuelve a demostrar el porqu\u00e9 se ha convertido en uno de los \u2018cantautores\u2019 preferidos del p\u00fablico, al interprerar canciones como \u201cCon M\u00fasica Rom\u00e1ntica\u201d, \u201cEl Paso De La Iguana\u201d, \u201cH\u00e1blame Claro\u201d, \u201cDebajo De Los Laureles\u201d y la que da t\u00edtulo a este disco. Pero el talento y la creatividad de Pancho no deja de fluir y para mediados del 2000, casi a la par, lanza dos producciones. Una de estas es \u201cFormas De Vivir\u201d, con la que expone su gran versatilidad como autor, int\u00e9rprete y arreglista. Se trata de un disco completo, con acompa\u00f1amiento de su propio mariachi. Incluye temas a ritmo de cumbia como \u201cTienes Que Volver\u201d, \u201cRegresa Por Favor\u201d, \u201cMi Dama\u201d y \u201cSi Por Amor\u201d. La otra producci\u00f3n a ritmo de banda se llama \u201cVuelve Por Favor\u201d. Por primera vez incluye una bachata (\u201cBurbuja De Amor\u201d) y un tema a ritmo de soca (\u201cPu tun tun\u201d), cumbias (\u201cLa Roncona\u201d, \u201cEl Muerto Se Fue De Rumba\u201d y \u201cEl Toro Baquet\u00f3n\u201d) y las rancheras que tan bien le van (\u201cArr\u00e1ncame La Vida\u201d, \u201cNo Volver\u00e9\u201d, \u201cCuando Nadie Te Quiera\u201d, \u201cA La Luz De Un Farol\u201d, \u201c\u00c1nimas Que No Amanezca\u201d y \u201cEl Dinero\u201d) y una balada (\u201cVuelve Por Favor\u201d). Por su trayectoria y sus logros, su nombre es muy importante para quienes realmente gustan de la m\u00fasica popular. Pancho Barraza comenz\u00f3 el nuevo milenio con la alegre producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica \u201cSinverg\u00fcenza Y Mujeriego\u201d, grabada bajo el sello que lo ha visto crecer: Discos Musart/ Balboa Records. Con \u201cSinverg\u00fcenza y Mujeriego\u201d, sigui\u00f3 en los primeros sitios de popularidad, sonando fuertemente en las estaciones de radio y sorprendiendo a propios y extra\u00f1os por su mezcla de ritmos y gran calidad art\u00edstica, con \u00e9xitos tan inolvidables como \u201cTe Esperar\u00e9\u201d, que contin\u00faa en la programaci\u00f3n de muchas emisoras hasta siete a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su estreno. As\u00ed se proyecta el talento de este artista excepcional, cuyo cat\u00e1logo crece cada d\u00eda en sus tres facetas principales: compositor, cantante y m\u00fasico. As\u00ed tambi\u00e9n lo confirman sus grabaciones m\u00e1s recientes para Discos Musart/ Balboa Records: \u201cEn Vivo\u201d, donde se dio el lujo de que el p\u00fablico presente le hiciera un coro formado por miles de gargantas; y \u201cPancho Barraza Con El Alma En La Mano\u201d, un \u00e1lbum en que volvi\u00f3 al estilo ranchero que tanto le gusta, obviamente acompa\u00f1ado de mariachi. Ahora mismo, en este 2008 lo m\u00e1s reciente de su discograf\u00eda en Estados Unidos es su \u00e1lbum \u201cLa M\u00e1s Hermosa\u201d, donde acompa\u00f1ado de su propia banda presenta 12 nuevas canciones, todas escritas por el \u00e9l mismo. El primer corte promocional de este CD es la balada banda \u201cTe Voy A Olvidar\u201d. De emotiva letra y dentro de ese estilo caracter\u00edstico que lo identifica, este sencillo se perfila como otro gran \u00e9xito en su trayectoria.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Tejada ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Techno, Electronic", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Los Angeles DJ and producer Tejada has been releasing minimal techno since the early '90s, often finding himself lumped alongside Detroit techno maverick Matthew Dear.

The set of 11 songs and two bonus tracks launches with the soaring fingerpicking of the title track, leading the listener through a tour de force showcase of D\u2019Agostino\u2019s mastery and artistry.\n\nNumbers like \u201cBarefoot in Rio\u201d (on which D\u2019Agostino makes a rare appearance on nylon string guitar), \u201cCowboy Minestrone\u201d (an homage to master country picker Jerry Reed) and \u201cReggae Ragu\u201d travel through spots on the musical globe where he finds stylistic inspiration to blend with his own international roots, while \u201cSan Francisco 1982\u201d revisits the allure of the city he first visited on vacation that year and soon after returned to and made his home. \u201cStreet Pulse\u201d bristles with a kinetic urban energy, \u201cImminent Dawn\u201d evokes the mystical junction of night becoming day, \u201cJump Rope\u201d is a stunning showcase of guitar athleticism and dexterousness, and the sparse and subdued \u201cSilence In Between\u201d captures the music in the space among the notes. \u201cClare\u2019s Gifts\u201d and \u201cSweet Sylvia\u201d are D\u2019Agostino\u2019s musical Mona Lisas that paint women on guitar. D\u2019Agostino wraps it up with two Italiano melodic deserts on the bonus tracks: \u201cNella Fantasia,\u201d an Ennio Morricone melody (originally \u201cGabriel\u2019s Oboe\u201d in the film The Mission) with lyrics by Chiara Ferrau, beautifully sung by Peppino\u2019s daughter Aleza, and the spry folk classicism of \u201cLa Gazza Ladra.\u201d\n\nAfter a listen to Nine White Kites, It\u2019s no wonder that Acoustic Guitar says that D\u2019Agostino is \u201cone of the most capable composers among fingerstyle guitarists\u201d while the San Jose Mercury News notes his \u201cgift for writing emotionally evocative tunes.\u201d The title reflects the fact that \u201cmusic is weightless,\u201d D\u2019Agostino observes. \u201cBut if you think about it, it can create very deep and heavy feelings. The kite is very light, like music, but it also can evoke feelings. Plus it symbolizes a sense of freedom, and kites are universal, found all around the world.\u201d\n\nA native of Italy, D\u2019Agostino has made his considerable international mark as a musical artist on the guitar since he arrived in America a little over 25 years ago. The readers of Guitar Player voted him Best Acoustic Guitarist in 2007, and the following year in Acoustic Guitar\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards he won a Bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time for his 2002 release Every Step of The Way (tying with Leo Kottke, one of his prime inspirations) and another Bronze award as Fingerstyle Guitarist of the Year. But as said above, it\u2019s not just his talent that makes D\u2019Agostino so notable, but also what he does with it.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune praises his \u201cvirtuosity and complexity\u201d as well as his gift for composing \u201cmemorable melodies.\u201d He is also an \u201castonishing entertainer\u201d (Anchorage Daily News). Yet it\u2019s what Guitar One has noted as his \u201clyrical artistry\u201d and fellow master player Adrian Legg describes as the \u201cwarm humanity\u201d of his playing that has earned him the stature of being a \u201cphenom,\u201d as Jazziz raves.\n\nHow has D\u2019Agostino earned such high praise and honors? \u201cMusic is not only what you know musically, but also what you experience in life, because it is a reflection of our personalities and spirit,\u201d he explains. In his playing and writing one feels his heart, spirit, soul and essence as well as your own.\n\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 10 when he heard his cousin play in church. After D\u2019Agostino got a few lessons from the cousin, he embarked on a journey of self-study and further exploration on the guitar and in music that continues today. So in addition to his \u201ctechnical prowess\u201d (Guitar One), he displays a stunning stylistic range in his work that spans classical to pop music and incorporates a spectrum of folk, ethnic and world styles. From his teens into his twenties, D\u2019Agostino learned about and absorbed many musical colors and flavors, being so enthralled with all to know about music and his chosen instrument that he went AWOL one night from the Italian Army to catch a concert by some acoustic guitarists he admired.\n\nAfter making his recorded mark in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later \u2014 both discs collaborations with fellow players that set the stage for many to follow \u2014 he moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants and then clubs and concerts after a fellow musician introduced D\u2019Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records, and has since issued six more albums prior to Nine White Kites, the most recent being Made in Italy, a musical travelogue through the songs and composers of the country where he was born and came of age.\n\nHe has released the collaborations Classic/Steel (2001) with contemporary classical guitar master David Tanenbaum and Bayshore Road (2005) with his close friend and virtuoso electric player Stef Burns. D\u2019Agostino also performs and has recorded with the United Guitar Ensemble, which features his steel string guitar alongside eight nylon string classical masters.\n\nHe has also released three instructional/performance DVDs as well as the book New Acoustic Guitar (Warner Bros. Publications), and also designed his signature Seagull guitar with innovative guitar maker Robert Godin that won a Silver People\u2019s Choice Award for Acoustic Guitar of the Year from Acoustic Guitar magazine in 2008. A hot ticket live performer in North and South America and Europe, he charms audiences with performances that are captivating and full-blooded musical experiences.\n\n\u201cI play Brazilian music, Irish music, country music, blues, ragtime, classical,\u201d he says of just some of the many styles heard within what he creates. Inspired by such diverse players as Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, among many others, his influences also include the progressive rockers like Genesis, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Mike Oldfield he listened to in his teens and early adulthood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my curiosity,\u201d D\u2019Agostino explains. \u201cA lot of people stay within a frame and say they play blues and they play blues all their life. And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not judging anyone. But the way my brain works I need to explore different styles and what\u2019s available there and what\u2019s possible and what others do.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeppino writes wonderful guitar pieces,\u201d says Kottke of his onetime acolyte. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorite composers for this cranky instrument. Plus, he\u2019s a tone player. I love his sound\u2026 [he] gets the resin and the wood.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Agostino likens his musical approach to the culinary artistry of his native Italy. \u201cIf you only know about tomatoes, garlic and basil, you will only make a certain kind of sauce. But if you know about maybe thyme, parsley, onions and olives, you make a different kind of recipe. But you have to know how to mix those elements with discretion and elegance.\u201d The results provide a delectable and nutritious listening experience for music lovers of all tastes that brings D\u2019Agostino satisfaction that radiates throughout his self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d. For as he says, \u201cOur job as musicians is to try to do what we love.self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d.

Their latest release\u202f'The Perplexed Sky'\u202f is a story of highs and lows; of intense relationships, of bliss, delusions and the resurfacing of demons. Singer/songwriter Jack Murray plays with the idea of self in today\u2019s world, examining how our own perceptions are different than how others see us. \u202f'The Perplexed Sky\u202f' was produced by J. Robbins, a prominent figure in the legendary DC music scene of the 80s and 90s, at Magpie Cage in Baltimore. J\u2019s previous work includes Jawbox and Government Issue (member) as well as Clutch, Against Me!, and Jawbreaker (recording and production) among many others. The album is available on translucent dark purple vinyl, CD, and all digital platforms.\n\nThe band\u2019s live shows are a mix of noise, melody and frustration. As a duo, Jack uses guitars with bass parts built-in, creating distinct bass and guitar sounds that feed into separate amplifiers. Influenced by bands such as The Wipers, Screaming Trees, REM, Agent Orange, Nirvana and the White Stripes, they are often described as ranging from surf punk to garage rock, alternative and even paisley underground. One promoter described their new album as \u201cdream grunge alt-punk\u201d while the album\u2019s producer J. Robbins said certain elements reminded him of post-punk band The Chameleons.\n\nThe band has its roots in Gainesville, FL where they released their first EP\u202f'Kakistocracy' (2015), recorded by Roger Lima (Less Than Jake). Shortly after, Jack moved to NYC where the band released their second EP\u202f'\u2026Or the Devil Will Get You'\u202f recorded at If and Only If Productions in Brooklyn as well as a limited 7\u2033 split on Leesta Vall Sound Recordings. In 2017 Jack came to Baltimore and immersed himself in the local scene.

The reflective piano ballad \u201cFriend\u201d opens the album with Witt sifting through feelings of attraction for someone she knows should be just a pal and not a lover, while the aching vocal showcase \u201cConsolation Prize\u201d pairs torchy piano with taut electric guitar accents as Witt muses over the ways in which we edit our pasts to fit the present. Revisionary history, indeed \u2014 the album title comes from a lyric in that song.\n\n\u201cWe can constantly be revising how we remember things, and maybe that\u2019s not so bad,\u201d says Witt, whose TV credits include The Sopranos, Friday Night Lights and Law & Order: Criminal Intent. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s how we move on.\u201d\n\nProduced by Ben Folds, Revisionary History was years in the making. Some of the songs date back to the mid-\u201900s, which gave her plenty of time to hone them in concert before heading to Folds\u2019 studio in Nashville, where she recorded the album in two week-long chunks in the spring and late fall of 2013.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got such a unique and specific vision for how those songs should best be presented,\u201d Witt says of Folds. \u201cI had no doubt that he was going to bring to it his own vision for the sound of each song, but he also wanted it to be a truthful reflection of what I do. The record sounds very much like me.\u201d\n\nWitt credits Folds for digging into the essence of each song for musical arrangements that sometimes brought out their hidden sides: the folky stomp on \u201cBlind,\u201d for example, highlighted the rootsy touches in a song Witt had been performing for years, while the mournful trumpet and marching drumbeat perfectly captured the mood on \u201cDown,\u201d a tune inspired by the smart but troubled character Witt played on Season Five of the Emmy-nominated FX series Justified, featuring the Emmy-nominated New York rapper and actor T.O.N.E-z\n\n\u201cWhen I heard it all put together, it made me cry,\u201d Witt says. \u201cAt the end, when the trumpet comes in, it sounds like a soul making its way up.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the girl-power anthem \u201cAbout Me,\u201d which shows the influence of Folds and Billy Joel in the robust piano and Witt\u2019s defiant determined vocals; or the lush, sultry \u201960s-style pop tune \u201cTheme From Pasadena,\u201d which Witt wrote with Folds for the movie Cold Turkey (Witt starred opposite Peter Bogdanovich and Cheryl Hines in the indie drama, which was originally to be called Pasadena). In fact, Revisionary History boasts such an array of sounds and styles that there\u2019s no pigeonholing Witt as a musician.\n\n\u201cI love all different types of music, so the songs that I come up with and am drawn to when I\u2019m writing are naturally all over the place,\u201d says Witt, whose movie credits include 88 Minutes with Al Pacino and Two Weeks Notice with Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.\n\nWitt has been a music lover since she was a little girl growing up in Worcester, Mass. She began playing piano when she was 7, competing in international piano competitions into her teen years. After she moved to Los Angeles at 14, she supported herself by playing in the lobby lounge of the Beverly Wilshire hotel until she landed her first regular acting job on the CBS show Cybil when she was 16. It took a few more years before she began consistently writing her own songs, and it wasn\u2019t until 2008 that she started performing them. Her first gig was opening for Jimmy Webb at a benefit in New York. Moving from standards and show tunes to original songs was a big leap for Witt.\n\n\u201cThere was a considerable fear factor,\u201d she says. \u201cAs an actor doing theater and doing live television, it wasn\u2019t about performing for people. It was about performing my own music. That\u2019s incredibly vulnerable.\u201d\n\nWitt\u2019s fears that audiences wouldn\u2019t respond proved very much unfounded, and the vulnerability of opening up to strangers helped her make the all-important connection that turned them into fans. 'The most that I can hope for is telling these stories that are incredibly personal, but saying them in a way that somebody else can relate to their own experiences,\" says Witt.\n\nbio:\n\nAlicia Witt has had a 3-decade long career, starting with her acting debut in David Lynch\u2019s classic \u2018Dune\u2019.\n\nWitt was most recently seen on Season 4 of the Emmy-award winning Showtime series \u2018House of Lies\u2019 opposite Don Cheadle. This past season, Alicia also appeared on the new DirecTv series \u2018The Kingdom\u2019, on the hit CBS show \u2018Elementary\u2019, and in 2015 in the new TNT series \u2018The Librarians\u2019, a role which she will be reprising on Season 2.\n\nIn 2014, Alicia joined the 5th Season of Emmy-award winning FX series \u2018Justified\u2019 with Timothy Olyphant. Alicia played Wendy Crowe, the smart and sexy paralegal sister of crime lord Darryl Crowe (Michael Rapaport) who takes matters into her own hands to bring him to justice in the Season 5 finale. Last summer she appeared at the Geffen Playhouse in the Los Angeles debut of Tony-nominated Neil Labute play \u2018reasons to be pretty\u2019. The four-hander also starred Amber Tamblyn, Shawn Hatosy and Nick Gehlfuss, and was directed by Randall Arney, Artistic Director of the Geffen.\n\nTo viewers of the Hallmark Channel, Alicia may be best known for her Christmas films \u2018Christmas at Cartwright\u2019s\u2019 (2014) and \u2018A Very Merry Mix-Up\u2019 (2013), which have become their highest rated of all time.\n\nIn 2013, Alicia appeared opposite Peter Bogdanovich and Cheryl Hines in the independent family dramedy 'Cold Turkey', in a performance which NY Daily News critic David Edelstein hailed as one of the best of 2013, and garnered the headline \u2018See Cold Turkey For Alicia Witt\u2019s Performance\u2019 in the Village Voice. Also released in 2013 was the film 'I Do', which had a nationwide theatrical release after screening at 25 festivals worldwide and winning 10 awards. Alicia has two songs featured in this film as well.\n\nAlicia is an accomplished singer/songwriter. A classically trained pianist, for the past 7 years she has been performing her original piano-driven rock all across the world, and has opened for Ben Folds Five, Jimmy Webb and John Fullbright. Her newest album, \u2018Revisionary History\u2019, is produced by Ben Folds and released through Compass Records on May 5, 2015. Her self-titled first EP came out in 2009 and her Kickstarter funded album, 'Live at Rockwood' was released following a self-booked national tour in 2012. Her music can be found at www.aliciawittmusic.com.\n\nOther recent credits include the 2012 Samuel Goldwyn film 'Cowgirls n Angels', with James Cromwell, and Seasons 4 and 5 of the Emmy award winning Friday Night Lights on NBC. Alicia starred opposite Al Pacino in the 2008 feature film '88 Minutes' for director Jon Avnet. That same year she played Detective Nola Falacci opposite Chris Noth on NBC\u2019s 'Law & Order: Criminal Intent' for half a season, taking over for Julianne Nicholson while she was on maternity leave.\n\nOther roles include Paramount\u2019s 'Last Holiday' with Queen Latifah and Timothy Hutton, and New Line\u2019s critically acclaimed film \u2018The Upside of Anger\u2019, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, opposite Joan Allen & Kevin Costner. She also starred in Warner Bros\u2019 hit romantic comedy, 'Two Weeks Notice', opposite Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.\n\nWitt appeared on-stage in fall 2006 at London\u2019s Royal Court Theatre in Terry Johnson\u2019s 'Piano/Forte'. She made her West End debut with Neil LaBute\u2019s 'The Shape of Things'. She was also seen on stage in 'Dissonance' at the Williamstown Theatre Festival. In April 2015, Alicia took the stage at the Gramercy Theatre for the 24 Hour Musicals off Broadway, for the 4th time.\n\nIn 1994, Witt appeared in the critically acclaimed 'Fun', which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival. The film, directed by Rafal Zielinski, depicts a tale of two disturbed young girls whose quest for fun leads them to murder. Witt received the \u201cSpecial Jury Recognition\u201d Award at Sundance and a nomination for an Independent Spirit Award. In 1998, she starred in Columbia Tristar\u2019s hit horror movie, 'Urban Legend.\n\nOn television, Witt starred for four seasons as Cybill Shepherd\u2019s daughter Zoey on the hit CBS sitcom \u2018Cybill\u2019. She also guest starred on the phenomenally successful HBO series, \u2018The Sopranos\u2019, and the Emmy award winning \u2018Ally McBeal\u2019, in which she sang with Randy Newman. Witt combined her acting talents with her skills as a pianist in the romantic comedy, 'Playing Mona Lisa'.\n\nAlicia made her directorial debut with the short film 'Belinda\u2019s Swan Song', which she also wrote. The film premiered at the 2006 Rhode Island International Film Festival and was screened at 9 additional festivals around the world, including the Los Angeles International Short Film Festival.\n\nShe also appeared in 'Mr. Holland\u2019s Opus', opposite Richard Dreyfuss, as clarinet player Gertrude, as well as 'Four Rooms' (Miramax) with Tim Roth, Madonna, and Lili Taylor, and directed by Quentin Tarantino, Allison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, and Alexandre Rockwell.

It's the same kind of self-assurance the soft-spoken Rodgers displays on his second independently released EP, available January 19th. Produced by Mickey Jack Cones (Dustin Lynch, Joe Nichols) and Chris Farren, the five-song collection showcases him as both a talented writer and interpreter, merging the electrified rock he heard on the baseball diamond with the thoughtful lyricism of country. Well before he was singing for his supper, the Batesville, Mississippi native was an accomplished baseball player who was a scholarship athlete at Northwest Mississippi Community College. Raised in the midst of country's '90s commercial heyday \u2013 his first concert was Garth Brooks at the Pyramid in Memphis \u2013 Rodgers always had an inkling that he might end up living in Music City, he just didn't know how or when. \"I can remember in high school I would tell people \u2013 this was before I played guitar or anything \u2013 I would just be like, 'Yeah, I'm gonna move to Nashville one day,'\" he recalls. And so he did, departing Mississippi with one of his college buddies to see if he could make it in Music City. Through the countless open mic nights and lean years that inevitably followed, Rodgers was able to develop the songwriting voice that would eventually earn his first publishing deal with Combustion Music. \"I went into songwriting boot camp,\" he says. \"That's all I did. I hardly played any shows or anything. I just focused on writing.\" In the meantime, Rodgers scored his first cut on Florida Georgia Line's Dig Your Roots, with \"Wish You Were on It.\" He also released his self-titled EP, featuring the streaming hit \"Midnight Daydream.\" All that intense focus shows on his second self titled EP. Opening track \"Ain't Really Over\" depicts a man in the hangover stage of a rough breakup and trying to move on. Framed by surging, distorted electric guitars and Rodgers' bluesy howl, it sets the tone for his melody-rich, introspective style of songwriting. On \"Cold Case,\" Rodgers draws a line between himself and country's long tradition of clever wordplay. Bouncing off the title's suggestion of criminal investigations, he's popping tops and pining over a woman who's up and vanished from his life. His solution? Downing as many beers as he can handle. \"'Cold Case' was just one of those things \u2013 somebody started playing a guitar and one of us just spit it out,\" says Rodgers. \"It kind of fell out of thin air.\" Rodgers' clear sense of his artistic identity also shines through on the outside songs \"Like You've Been There Before\" and \"Some Girls.\" It's easy to envision Rodgers singing about a younger version of himself in \"Like You've Been There Before,\" a rebellious kid getting some sage advice from his father to play it cool whether he's knocking a fastball over the fences or cautiously taking his first trip around the bases with a young woman. He sings it with the easy confidence of a seasoned vet, or as he says in the chorus, \"like it ain't no thing.\" \"Some Girls,\" on the other hand, calls back to \"Ain't Really Over\" except this time he's ended things and she's not handling it well \u2013 talking behind his back and playing childish games on social media. \"Some girls make it easy on you,\" he sighs, \"and some girls never do.\" The female woes reach their apex in the Rodgers co-write \"Missing One,\" which flips the title phrase on its head. Initially it's a missing copy of the Eagles' Desperado that she took when she left, then a single smoke from a pack of cigarettes that she forced him to give up. But it turns out he's actually missing something else most of all. Rodgers wrote the tune with pals Smith Ahnquist and Hunter Phelps, taking months to get it right. \"We started it in January and we didn't finish it until May,\" he says. \"We knew it was gonna be a clever idea, but we had to get it right. It was a hard one, but a fun one.\" That dedication, coupled with Rodgers' finely-tuned ear for songs, makes him perfectly suited to lean forward into Nashville's ever-shifting winds while honoring his roots. \"I want to be known as the dude with good songs,\" he says. \"If a song gives you chill bumps or if it makes you cry or if it makes you happy, it's done its job.\" That may sound like a relatively humble mission for a performer with such promise, but hey, sometimes you just know.", "otherInfo": "Saturday Nights Live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Juelz ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10389012.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-31", "Genre": "Bass, Trap", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "For the last three years, Vancouver based producer Juelz has been building a catalog that fuses hip-hop and electronic boundaries effortlessly.

Their musical approach clashed with the then dominating ballads and happy pop tunes that filled the radio and TV programs, in offering dark and moody lyrics.\n\nfue un grupo mexicano de rock originalmente conformado por Sa\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez (voz y guitarra), Alfonso Andr\u00e9 (bater\u00eda y percusiones), Salvador \"Sabo\" Romo (bajo) y Diego Herrera (teclados y saxof\u00f3n). Su primera presentaci\u00f3n fue el 11 de abril de 1987 en Rockotitl\u00e1n. La expectaci\u00f3n creada en el underground rockero mexicano fue tanta que mucha gente se qued\u00f3 fuera del recinto. Si bien Caifanes era un grupo nuevo, la anterior banda de Sa\u00fal, Alejandro Marcovich y Alfonso Andr\u00e9, llamada Las Ins\u00f3litas Im\u00e1genes de Aurora, ten\u00eda una amplia base de fan\u00e1ticos.\n\nSu primer disco, Caifanes (a veces nombrado tambi\u00e9n M\u00e1tenme porque me muero, Volumen 1 o Disco negro) sali\u00f3 a la venta en agosto de 1988 y el sencillo M\u00e1tenme porque me muero fue su primer \u00e9xito, seguido por Viento y La negra Tomasa, una versi\u00f3n de una cumbia escrita por el m\u00fasico cubano Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez Fiffe. El disco mostraba claras influencias del grupo brit\u00e1nico The Cure. Gustavo Cerati particip\u00f3 como m\u00fasico invitado en la grabaci\u00f3n del \u00e1lbum tocando la guitarra en La bestia humana. Este \u00e1lbum fue precedido por un EP con tres canciones producido con la intenci\u00f3n de probar la aceptaci\u00f3n del grupo entre la posible audiencia; el resultado fue la venta de m\u00e1s de trescientas mil copias y, por lo tanto, la grabaci\u00f3n del primer LP.\n\nSu segundo disco fue Volumen II, pero es mejor conocido como El Diablito. Esto se debe a un error de impresi\u00f3n: en la portada aparece un letrero borroso que dice el diablito y es considerado el \"verdadero\" t\u00edtulo del disco, adem\u00e1s el dise\u00f1o gr\u00e1fico muestra el dibujo de un diablito de loter\u00eda. El guitarrista argentino-mexicano Alejandro Marcovich se integra al grupo; su presencia result\u00f3 notoria desde un principio y su estilo fue fundamental en lo que comenzar\u00eda a ser el sonido de Caifanes.\n\nEn El Diablito aparece una de las canciones m\u00e1s populares del grupo, La c\u00e9lula que explota. Esta canci\u00f3n, mezcla de balada rockera con m\u00fasica de mariachi, apunta muy claramente la direcci\u00f3n que Caifanes habr\u00eda de tomar a partir de ese punto: una mezcla de rock con elementos de la ampl\u00edsima gama de estilos que comprende la m\u00fasica popular mexicana.\n\nEn 1992 se edita El Silencio que incluye gran parte del repertorio cl\u00e1sico de Caifanes, como No dejes que ..., Mi\u00e9rcoles de Ceniza, Nubes y Nos vamos juntos. Cuando este disco sali\u00f3 a la venta el grupo ya era un \u00e9xito en M\u00e9xico, Centroam\u00e9rcia, algunos pa\u00edses de Sudam\u00e9rica y entre la comunidad hispana de Estados Unidos. En agosto de 1992 llenaron por completo el Hollywood Palladium de Los \u00c1ngeles. En 1993 hicieron lo mismo en el Palacio de los Deportes de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico, haza\u00f1a que ning\u00fan otro grupo de rock mexicano hab\u00eda logrado hasta el momento; con dicho concierto Sabo Romo y Diego Herrera se despidieron de la agrupaci\u00f3n.\n\nAl llegar 1994, Caifanes queda reducido a un tr\u00edo conformado por Sa\u00fal, Alfonso y Alejandro. Juntos dan forma al \u00faltimo \u00e1lbum de los Caifanes, El nervio del volc\u00e1n. Se eligen como sencillos las canciones Afuera, Aqu\u00ed no es as\u00ed y Ayer me dijo un ave. Su presencia en los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n crece y es seguida muy de cerca por los noticiarios de MTV Latino para quien realizaron un Unplugged y donde se documentaron tanto el creciente \u00e9xito internacional del grupo (por ejemplo, en esos d\u00edas abrieron el concierto de los Rolling Stones en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico y participaron en el festival WOMAD, organizado por Peter Gabriel) como las crecientes diferencias entre Hern\u00e1ndez y Marcovich (en un reportaje Sa\u00fal le pregunta a Alejandro \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 tenemos en com\u00fan?\" y Marc\u00f3vich responde sarc\u00e1sticamente: \"\u00bfEl n\u00famero de cromosomas?\"). Caifanes ofreci\u00f3 su \u00faltimo concierto el 18 de agosto de 1995 en la ciudad de San Luis Potos\u00ed.\n\nTras la desintegraci\u00f3n de Caifanes, Hern\u00e1ndez se dedica a recuperarse de un mal cr\u00f3nico en sus cuerdas vocales, e invita a Alfonso Andr\u00e9 (bater\u00eda), Federico Fong (bajo) y Jos\u00e9 Manuel Aguilera (guitarra) a formar un taller musical llamado Jaguares.\n[editar]\n\nEstilo\n\nAunque en un principio la m\u00fasica de Caifanes parec\u00eda ser simplemente una versi\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol de la m\u00fasica de The Cure, la inclusi\u00f3n de La negra Tomasa en el repertorio del grupo no era casual: Hern\u00e1ndez y Romo tienen ra\u00edces en colonias populares de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico. Sin embargo, Caifanes no volvi\u00f3 a apropiarse tan marcadamente de un estilo musical distinto del rock; por el contrario, incorpor\u00f3 elementos de la m\u00fasica popular mexicana en el esquema general de \u00e9ste.\n\nSi bien en El diablito la mayor parte de las canciones puede ser calificada simplemente como rock, las letras comienzan a tomar elementos populares (como la integraci\u00f3n total del dicho De noche todos los gatos son pardos en la canci\u00f3n hom\u00f3nima) y con La c\u00e9lula que explota se marca en gran medida el estilo cl\u00e1sico de Caifanes: letras demandantes y po\u00e9ticas y m\u00fasica a caballo entre el rock y la m\u00fasica mexicana. La presencia de Alejandro Marcovich, a partir de este disco se vuelve fundamental en el sonido del grupo, a tal grado que para muchos fan\u00e1ticos la diferencia principal entre Caifanes y Jaguares consiste en el estilo del guitarrista.\n\nLa c\u00e9lula que explota construida como una balada rock con arreglos de mariachi, es la primera de una serie de amalgamas. En El silencio las fusiones tocan de nuevo la m\u00fasica con una fuerte cadencia r\u00edtmica que en M\u00e9xico se tilda de guapachosa (Nubes, Hasta morir, Para que no digas que no pienso en ti), pero tambi\u00e9n la banda (Piedra), e inluso aparece una versi\u00f3n un son veracruzano, Mariquita, donde se combinan las tradicionales jaranas con las guitarras el\u00e9ctricas de Marcovich. Por \u00faltimo, en El nervio del volc\u00e1n experiementaron con r\u00edtmicas ind\u00edgenas (Afuera), dieron un toque de bolero a las percusiones de Ayer me dijo un ave y construyeron La llorona sobre el vals tradicional del mismo nombre.\n\nEs importante remarcar que aunque el estilo de Caifanes se define por sus fusiones entre rock y m\u00fasica tradicional, la mayor parte de su m\u00fasica es simplemente rock, inserto en la tradici\u00f3n musical hispanoamericana iniciada con en el rock argentino y que incorpora letras barrocas ancladas en la tradici\u00f3n po\u00e9tica de la regi\u00f3n. Las letras de Sa\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez est\u00e1n construidas, en su mayor\u00eda, con base en figuras muy complejas, dif\u00edciles de interpetar, sin necesidad de rimas y son fuertemente l\u00edricas. Las poqu\u00edsimas letras escritas por Alejandro Marcovich o por la mancuerna Hern\u00e1ndez/Marcovich siguen el mismo patr\u00f3n.\n[editar]\n\nIntegrantes\n\n* Sa\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez (1987-1995, voz y guitarra)\n* Alfonso Andr\u00e9 (1987-1995, bater\u00eda y percusiones)\n* Diego Herrera (1987-1993, teclados, saxof\u00f3n y jarana)\n* Alejandro Marc\u00f3vich (1989-1995, guitarra y requinto jarocho)\n* Salvador \"Sabo\" Romo (1987-1993, bajo)\n\n[editar]\n\nDiscograf\u00eda\n\n* Caifanes (1988)\n* Caifanes.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B. (Disco-Umphrey's McGee-Biscuits) tour with Umphrey's McGee. Bandmembers from both Umphrey's and Bisco have further more found each other in The Brain Damaged Eggmen, a Pink Floyd and The Beatles coverband\n\n\nDiscography\n\n* Encephalous Crime (self-released, 1996)\n* Uncivilized Area (1998)\n* Bisco Lives (2000)\n* They Missed the Perfume (2001)\n* Se\u00f1or Boombox (2002)\n* TranceFusion Radio Broadcast Vol. 1-4 (2003)\n* Wind at Four to Fly (2006)\n* Rocket 3 (2007)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Clarks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10364854.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-31", "Genre": "Alt Country Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Early on, The Clarks were once described as a bunch of out of tune country hicks.

The Crowes are listed at #92 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of hard rock\".\n\nAt the time of their 1990 debut, the kind of rock & roll the Black Crowes specialize in was out of style. Only Guns N' Roses came close to approximating a vintage Stones-style raunch, but they were too angry and jagged to pull it off completely. The Black Crowes replicated that Stonesy swagger and Faces boogie perfectly. Vocalist Chris Robinson appropriated the sound and style of vintage Rod Stewart while guitarist Rich Robinson fused Keith Richards' lean attack with Ron Wood's messy rhythmic sense. At their best, the Black Crowes echo classic rock without slavishly imitating their influences.\n\nThe Robinson brothers originally formed the Black Crowes in Georgia in 1984. By the time of their 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker, the group comprised Chris Robinson (vocals), Rich Robinson (guitar), Johnny Colt (bass), Jeff Cease (guitar), and Steve Gorman (drums). \"Jealous Again,\" the first single from Shake Your Money Maker, was a moderate hit but it was the band's cover of Otis Redding's \"Hard to Handle\" that made the group a multi-platinum success. \"Hard to Handle\" climbed its way into the Top 40, propelling the album into the Top Ten. The acoustic ballad \"She Talks to Angels\" became the band's second Top 40 hit in the spring of 1991. Shake Your Money Maker would eventually sell over three million copies.\n\nThe Black Crowes delivered their second album, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, in the spring of 1992, adding new lead guitarist Marc Ford and keyboardist Eddie Harsch. It entered the charts at number one, but it didn't have as many hit singles as the debut; none of the singles cracked the Top 40 and only \"Remedy\" and \"Thorn in My Pride\" made the Top 100. Nevertheless, the band established themselves as a popular concert attraction that summer, selling out theaters across America. The Black Crowes' third album, Amorica, arrived in late 1994. Amorica debuted in the Top Ten, but none of the singles from the album made the charts; even though the record went gold, it slipped off the charts in early 1995.\n\nThree Snakes & One Charm, the group's fourth album, was released in July of 1996. The album entered the charts at number 15, but it quickly slipped out of the Top 50. Nevertheless, the album received the best reviews of any Crowes album since The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. Guitarist Marc Ford was fired from the Black Crowes in August, 1997; two years later, the group returned with By Your Side. In mid-2000, the band collaborated with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page on the double-disc Live at the Greek, an eclectic mix of newly recorded Zeppelin covers and additional classic blues cuts. A Tribute to a Work in Progress: Greatest Hits 1990-1999, a 16-track best-of compilation was also released in mid-2000. The Don Was-produced Lions appeared in spring 2001, and a summer tour with Oasis -- the Tour of Brotherly Love -- followed in June. But all was apparently not well with the group, in January of 2002 the band announced that they were on hiatus. Drummer Steve Gorman was fired from the band, and Chris Robinson announced his intentions for a solo career.\n\nThe Black Crowes have since reunited. All members circa 1992 are back, with the addition of one of their previous bassists, Sven Pipien, and harmony singers Mona Lisa Young and Charity White. They are enjoying a renaissance within the group as well as with their longtime fan base and have been consistently touring since formally reuniting in March 2005. In November of 2007, it was announced that North Mississippi Allstar guitarist Luther Dickinson formally joined the band, replacing Paul Stacey. He appears throughout the Crowes' album Warpaint, which will be released in March of 2008.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jameson Rodgers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9914459.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-31", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"You kind of know if it's your song or not, after you write it,\" says singer-songwriter Jameson Rodgers, explaining the strange, mystical process by which new tunes are brought into the world and find their intended performer. It's the same kind of self-assurance the soft-spoken Rodgers displays on his second independently released EP, available January 19th. Produced by Mickey Jack Cones (Dustin Lynch, Joe Nichols) and Chris Farren, the five-song collection showcases him as both a talented writer and interpreter, merging the electrified rock he heard on the baseball diamond with the thoughtful lyricism of country. Well before he was singing for his supper, the Batesville, Mississippi native was an accomplished baseball player who was a scholarship athlete at Northwest Mississippi Community College. Raised in the midst of country's '90s commercial heyday \u2013 his first concert was Garth Brooks at the Pyramid in Memphis \u2013 Rodgers always had an inkling that he might end up living in Music City, he just didn't know how or when. \"I can remember in high school I would tell people \u2013 this was before I played guitar or anything \u2013 I would just be like, 'Yeah, I'm gonna move to Nashville one day,'\" he recalls. And so he did, departing Mississippi with one of his college buddies to see if he could make it in Music City. Through the countless open mic nights and lean years that inevitably followed, Rodgers was able to develop the songwriting voice that would eventually earn his first publishing deal with Combustion Music. \"I went into songwriting boot camp,\" he says. \"That's all I did. I hardly played any shows or anything. I just focused on writing.\" In the meantime, Rodgers scored his first cut on Florida Georgia Line's Dig Your Roots, with \"Wish You Were on It.\" He also released his self-titled EP, featuring the streaming hit \"Midnight Daydream.\" All that intense focus shows on his second self titled EP. Opening track \"Ain't Really Over\" depicts a man in the hangover stage of a rough breakup and trying to move on. Framed by surging, distorted electric guitars and Rodgers' bluesy howl, it sets the tone for his melody-rich, introspective style of songwriting. On \"Cold Case,\" Rodgers draws a line between himself and country's long tradition of clever wordplay. Bouncing off the title's suggestion of criminal investigations, he's popping tops and pining over a woman who's up and vanished from his life. His solution? Downing as many beers as he can handle. \"'Cold Case' was just one of those things \u2013 somebody started playing a guitar and one of us just spit it out,\" says Rodgers. \"It kind of fell out of thin air.\" Rodgers' clear sense of his artistic identity also shines through on the outside songs \"Like You've Been There Before\" and \"Some Girls.\" It's easy to envision Rodgers singing about a younger version of himself in \"Like You've Been There Before,\" a rebellious kid getting some sage advice from his father to play it cool whether he's knocking a fastball over the fences or cautiously taking his first trip around the bases with a young woman. He sings it with the easy confidence of a seasoned vet, or as he says in the chorus, \"like it ain't no thing.\" \"Some Girls,\" on the other hand, calls back to \"Ain't Really Over\" except this time he's ended things and she's not handling it well \u2013 talking behind his back and playing childish games on social media. \"Some girls make it easy on you,\" he sighs, \"and some girls never do.\" The female woes reach their apex in the Rodgers co-write \"Missing One,\" which flips the title phrase on its head. Initially it's a missing copy of the Eagles' Desperado that she took when she left, then a single smoke from a pack of cigarettes that she forced him to give up. But it turns out he's actually missing something else most of all. Rodgers wrote the tune with pals Smith Ahnquist and Hunter Phelps, taking months to get it right. \"We started it in January and we didn't finish it until May,\" he says. \"We knew it was gonna be a clever idea, but we had to get it right. It was a hard one, but a fun one.\" That dedication, coupled with Rodgers' finely-tuned ear for songs, makes him perfectly suited to lean forward into Nashville's ever-shifting winds while honoring his roots. \"I want to be known as the dude with good songs,\" he says. \"If a song gives you chill bumps or if it makes you cry or if it makes you happy, it's done its job.\" That may sound like a relatively humble mission for a performer with such promise, but hey, sometimes you just know.", "otherInfo": "Saturday Nights Live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ MADD\u00d8G ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10282312.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-31", "Genre": "Electro House, Techno, Electronic, House", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "MADD\u00d8G has shared lineups with such artists as Ke$ha, Betty Who, Big Freedia, Matt & Kim, Girl Talk, and Big Dipper to name a few.

Timbiriche included six children, most of whose parents were famous actors/singers/composers. Their names were Paulina Rubio, Sasha Sokol, Benny Ibarra, Diego Schoening, Mariana Garza, and Alix Bauer. Later on, Erick Rub\u00edn would join the sextet. The name \"Timbiriche\" is the Spanish (Latin American Spanish) version of the game Dots and Boxes.\n\nIn 1985, the group starred in the teenage version of the stage production of Grease (Vaselina in Spanish), going on tour to major cities in Mexico.\n\nBy 1986, when they were all teenagers, the band's fame was almost at its highest. Thal\u00eda replaces Sasha and Eduardo Capetillo replaces\nBenny Ibarra, but they continue to succeed. Sasha's leaving of the group was very hard for the fans to accept as she was one of the favorites, and Thalia had a lot to live up to.\n\nOther famous replacements for the original members of the group were Bibi Gaytan and Edith M\u00e1rquez. Diego Schoening was the only one to never leave the group.\n\nIn 1990, the album 10 was released with the same success as the previous album.\n\nIn 1992, most of the members left the group and where replaced with new ones. They released 11. Surprisingly, the group managed to maintain its popularity. The final album released was 12. After that album, the group officially ended.\n\nIn 1998, the original group reunited for the Mexican summer show Acapulco '98. With the success of the reunion show, a 4-night engagement was booked at the National Auditorium in Mexico City. The 10,000 seat auditorium sold out quickly, generating the need for at least 16 shows. In the end, the group performed a total of 20 shows, breaking the record of 17 shows previously set by Luis Miguel at the venue. Later, they went on a national tour, from which came a live double album and three new songs, \"Est\u00e1 Despierto,\" \"Suma C\u00f3smica,\" and \"La Fuerza del Amor.\" \"Est\u00e1 Despierto\" was released as a single.\n\nBuscando a Timbiriche, La Nueva Banda, a reality show on Univisi\u00f3n, aired beginning in July 2007. An American Idol-type show, 30 participants competed to re-form the band.\n\n2007 marks the 25th Anniversary of Timbiriche. With this in Mind Timbiriche will tour Mexico and the USA, calling their tour \"Timbiriche 25\". Scheduled are 20 dates in Mexico y 10 in USA. The participants of this tour will be the 6 Timbiriche origianls: Sasha Sokol, Benny Ibarra, Diego Schoening, Mariana Garza, Alix Bauer, Erick Rub\u00edn.\n\nYears Active:1982-1994 2007-Present\n\n== Discography ==\n1982 - Timbiriche\n1982 - The Band Timbiriche\n1983 - the Timbiriche Band In Concert\n1983 - Disc noise\n1984 - Grease with Timbiriche\n1985 - Rock show\n1987 - Timbiriche 7\n1988 - Timbiriche VIII and IX\n1989 - the Classic ones of Timbiriche\n1990 - Timbiriche 10\n1992 - Timbiriche 11\n1993 - Timbiriche XII\n1999 - Timbiriche the Concert\n\nHistory ==\n\nThe group appeared for the first time the 30 of April of 1982 in the popular program of televis\u00ed\u00f3n \"Siempre en DomingO\" led by Raul Velasco, sponsored by the musical producer Luis de Llano and the outstanding Spanish singer Miguel Bos\u00e9.\n\nThat same year they released their first disc \"TIMBIRICHE\" with six members Alix, Benny, Diego, Mariana, Paulina and Sasha that gained the heart of mexican children immediately and just a year later they send to its second LP \"Banda Timbiriche\" and later \"Banda Timbiriche en Concierto\".\n\nThat same year Erick joins the group and send to a new disc \"Ruido\". Time later the seven small ones mount the play \"Grease\" and put out the album \"Grease WITH TIMBIRICHE\".\n\nFor 1986 the evolution begins, and the old children's group gives rise to a new sound but fresh and directed to an adolescent public.\n\n\"TIMBIRICHE ROCK SHOW\" is released and immediately reaches number one in sales; in this album, several songs stand out that with time became classic like: Soy Un Desastre\", \"Corro, Vuelo Me Acelero\".\n\nFor 1987 they released \"TIMBIRICHE 7\" with 2 new members then Benny leaves the group to continue with his studies and Sasha to make a carreer as a solist. Their place was taken by Eduardo and Thalia. With \"7 TIMBIRICHE\" the group increases their success and they consolidate as a youth group. From this album hits came off like: Rompecabezas, Besos de Ceniza, Con Todos Menos Conmigo.\n\nAround 1988 Mariana leaves the group to work as actress and enters Edith.\n\n\"TIMBIRICHE XVIII leaves the album on sale and IX\" this disc without a doubt mark the culminating point in the musical race of the group. Songs like: Amame Hasta Con los dientes ,and Tu Y Yo Somos Uno Mismo, marked an era.\n\nFor 1990 he leaves \"TIMBIRICHE 10\" not without before taking step to a album of hits recorded with the Symphonic Orchestra of Mexico City : \"the Classic ones of Timbiriche\".\n\n\"TIMBIRICHE 10\" is considered by many like the last album that conserves the original style of the band, that at the moment counted already single with three of the original members (Paulina, Diego and Erick) and Edith, to them Claudia, Bibi added themselves and Patty (that despues of single months in the group would be replaced by Silvia) then Eduardo, Thalia and Alix leave the group to prepare themselves like solits. For these heights, the group no longer was as united as before and in the concerts or interviews it almost always lacked some member.\n\nAlthough the good disc profit sales and I include hits as Princess Tibetana and ME Pongo Mal. But in 1991 the band returns with 6 new members (Tannya, Kenya, Alexa, Lorena, Mano and Jean) Diego as only the original one and enters records \"TIMBIRICHE 11\" and is presented/displayed in a special program of \"Siempre en Domingo\"\n\nIn spite of conserving the name and the concept in general, there were a new musical style that mixed dances and tropical rates. Although \"TIMBIRICHE 11\" was not very popular between fans, for 1992 they record \"12 TIMBIRICHE\" disc of which was given off the one that was considered like last hit of the grouping: Muriendo Lento.\n\nBut the group was lost its enchantment and finally it disintegrate in the middle of 1994. In 1998 the encounter with the original members of the festival ACAPULCO 98 occurs within the framework (without Erick). This encounter generated commotion between the followers who asked a tour.\n\nFor 1999 the tour is reality was developed by all Mexico and part of Latin America and included the seven original members. This Tour established in the National Audience of the City of Mexico a record of hearing with but of 20 consecutive concerts and him a new disc \"TIMBIRICHE was come off the CONCERT\" that was recorded live in the National Audience day 20 of December of 1999 which I include three new themes.

There is not an ounce of excess baggage on the fresh, dynamic tunes that Rod and Gab present here, which blend metal, jazz and Hispanic roots music in their own unique, unmistakable style\n\nThrough relentless touring and terrific word-of-mouth support, Rodrigo y Gabriela have established themselves as an in-demand live act, particularly in America, where they sold out the Hollywood Bowl (two nights) and the Red Rocks Amphitheatre as recently as summer 2018. They have also sold out multiple nights at the Royal Albert Hall in London, Le Zenith in Paris and Radio City Music Hall in New York, not to mention venues in Australia, Japan and Europe. They are recognised by their fans and critics alike as being one of the top live touring acts in the world.\n\n\u2018Mettavolution\u2019 has been three years in the making, the duo going back to the heart of their music, to feel the same way they did when they first moved from Mexico City to Ireland back in 1999, searching to reconnect with the original intention and (in their own words) \u201cthe reason of why we do what we do, to share something we do with all our hearts in order to inspire, even to heal people through music\u201d.\n\nIn 2010, Rodrigo and Gabriela were invited by President Obama to perform at a reception he hosted for the President and First Lady of Mexico. Rod and Gab have also contributed to the musical soundtracks of \u2018Puss In Boots\u2019 (2011) and \u2018Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\u2019 (with Hans Zimmer) in the same year. With career album sales well in excess of 1.5 million worldwide, Rodrigo y Gabriela have established themselves as globally successful artists who are eager to write new chapters in their already illustrious story.\n\n\u2018Mettavolution\u2019 is Rodrigo y Gabriela reborn, reaching for a higher state of consciousness, pushing themselves as writers, interpreters and players, and challenging us the listener to absorb, engage and respond to them.\n\nStudio discography\n\nRodrigo y Gabriela - 2006\n\n11:11 - 2009\n\nArea 52 (with C.U.B.A.) - 2012\n\n9 Dead Alive - 2014\n\nMettavolution - 2019", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.comusicrelief.org"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brent Cowles ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9426996.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-31", "Genre": "Denver, Colorado", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"I wanted to write a song that wasn\u2019t sad or negative. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love a solid heartbreak tune, but I had never written anything else.\" admits Brent Cowles, as he described the impetus for \"High to Low\", his brand new single available October 18th.\n\n\"I wanted to make people dance and smile\" he continued. So Brent locked himself in an LA studio with producer and songwriter Lewis Pesacov, of Fool's Gold fame, and they put together the funky foundations for \"High To Low.\u201d Brent and Lewis built the song around the bass-line. The result is exuberant, good time rock n roll. Says Brent, \"It\u2019s a song about dancing like everyone is watching, and you don\u2019t give a damn.\"\n\nBlurring the lines between boisterous rock, R&B, and contemplative folk, Brent\u2019s infectious voice and knack for melody seem to swing effortlessly from quavering intimacy to a soulful roar as they soar atop his exuberant, explosive arrangements.\n\nGrowing up, Cowles first discovered the power of his voice singing hymns at his father\u2019s church in Colorado Springs. Having a pastor for a parent meant heavy involvement in religious life, but Cowles never quite seemed to fit in. At 16 he fell in love with secular music; at 17 he recorded his first proper demos in a friend\u2019s basement; at 18 he was married; at 19 he was divorced. Meanwhile, what began as a solo musical project blossomed into the critically acclaimed band You Me & Apollo, which quickly took over his life. The Denver Post raved that the group created \u201csome of the most exciting original music in Colorado,\u201d while Westword proclaimed that their live show was a \u201cclinic in roots rock mixed with old-school swing and blues,\u201d and Seattle NPR station KEXP hailed \u201cCowles\u2019 Otis Redding and Sam Cooke inspired vocals.\u201d The band released two albums and toured nationally before they called it quits and amicably went their separate ways.\n\nThe parting was a necessary but difficult one for Cowles. In the ensuing months and years, he would find himself alone more than ever before, at one point living out of his Chevy Tahoe just to make ends meet. But rather than break him, the experience only strengthened his resolve. \"High to Low\u201d gives the listener a real sense of Brent\u2019s current mood. His songs are more evolved yet simpler, his lyrics are stronger yet fragile. He hopes you love it, live it and get down with it.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Colter Wall ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10393090.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-31", "Genre": "Country, Western Swing", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Colter Wall is a prairie-born songwriter from Saskatchewan, Canada.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Hey Monea ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10387473.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sun May 31 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-31", "Genre": "Rock, Indie, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hey Monea are:\nDan Monea \u2013 vocalist, guitarist, shark fisherman, foodie\nNate Monea \u2013 vocalist, drummer, MacGyverer, skeptic\nStephen Fernandez \u2013 vocalist, bassist, herboligist, shaman\n\nHey Monea have always been driven by a healthy sense of wanderlust \u2013 a deep desire to see the world, try new things, and to challenge the limits of what is possible.

Dan and Nate were raised Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and it was their family\u2019s decision to leave that community that set the boys on a path toward pursuing deeper connection points. Every tour stop is an opportunity to meet people, be of service, an effort to build bonds with their audience.

Folks from the no new jails organization later formed a community bail fund, focusing on fighting the racial disparities in the Dane county jail system, a jail system with one of the worst racial disparities in the country. As part of the work with the newly formed bail fund, the hip hop community stepped up big time to help raise funds to free Black folks from jail. That's when Lil Guillotine decided to start creating revolutionary anticapitalist abolitionist hip hop for the movement.\n\nSince then, he has been featured in the local music rag, The Isthmus, as an up and coming rapper, and has been on tour with iconic underground Chicago rapper and former Anticon member, Serengeti.

I flunked out of college. I learned to play the guitar, lived on the beach, lived in the French Quarter, finally got laid, and didn't go to Viet Nam. I got back into school, started a band, got a job on Bourbon Street, graduated from college, flunked my draft physical, broke up my band, and went out on the road solo. I signed a record deal, got married, moved to Nashville, had my guitars stolen, bought a Mercedes, worked at Billboard Magazine, put out my first album, went broke, wrecked the Mercedes, got divorced, and moved to Key West. I sang and worked on a fishing boat, went totally crazy, did a lot of dope, met the right girl, made another record, had a hit, bought a boat, and sailed away to the Carribean. I started another band, worked the road, had my second and last hit, bought a house in Aspen, started spending summers in New England, got married, broke my leg three times in one year, had a baby girl, made more records, bought a bigger boat, and sailed away to St. Barts. I got seperated from the right girl, sold the boat, sold the house in Aspen, moved back to Key West, worked the road, and made more records. I rented an apartment in Paris, went to Brazil for Carnival, learned to fly, went into therapy, quit doing dope, bought my first seaplane, flew all over the Carribean, almost got a second divorce, moved to Malibu for more therapy, and got back with the right girl. I worked the road, moved back to Nashville, took off in an F-14 from an aircraft carrier, bought a summer home on Long Island, had another baby girl. I found the perfect seaplane and moved back to Florida. Cameron Marley joined me in the house of women. I built a home on Long Island, crashed the perfect seaplane, lived through it thanks to Navy training, tried to slow down a little, woke up one morning and I was looking at fifty, trying to figure what comes next. You have to take the best from whatever the situation is and go on. That's the whole point of the music to me. All through American history populist singers and humorists have served as the nation's tickle spot, people like Will Rogers and Mark Twain. I see myself in that vein and fulfilling that sort of responsibility. I give people a few shots. It's as much a satirical pinprick as anything else. You just have to remind people of the day-to-day funny things.
