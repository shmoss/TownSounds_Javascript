They debuted as Complicated Animals in 2015, with the release of their 6-song EP \u201cIn This Game\u201d. Written and recorded in a cabin in the woods in Michigan, \u201cIn This Game\u201d received rave reviews from blogs and journalists, and was called the \u201cbeginning of a new sound\u201d by PopMatters.\n\nComplicated Animals released their brand new single Show Me on 1/19/18. While creating their new track, Monica da Silva and Chad Alger were greatly inspired by their recent move to Los Angeles, the music of the 80s, a love for lush, dreamy pop songs, and all things David Lynch. The Brazilian American duo say that although their new track encompasses more of an electronic, synth-based feel, the lyrical subject matter was based on organic, human emotion.\n\n\u201cShow Me (that you want me) really struck me as an intense idea for a song,\u201d says vocalist da Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s scary how detached we humans have become. Technology is great, but we\u2019ve got to remember how important human interaction is, and not just go through the motions like zombies. For this song, Chad dug an old synthesizer we had out of the closet. We started stacking sounds and layering vocals. The production came together quickly, and virtually all of the sounds in the track were created using the same synth.\u201d\n\nMonica da Silva's song Back To His Girl is now featured in the movie Lady Bird. Complicated Animals\u2019 music has also been featured in The World Cup, on international compilations such as Putumayo World Music\u2019s Brazilian Beat, and Ibiza Beats, in the BBC One drama The Replacement, and is slated to appear in the upcoming Paramount Network series American Woman.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8537608.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.272224, 38.2465247], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Indie Pop, Brazilian Music, Bossa Nova, Electronic, Dream Pop, Alternative, Acoustic, Singer, Songwriter", "OtherInfo": "Enjoy live music, lawn games, and drink specials to welcome your weekend in Wine Country.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Add in five years as a staff worship leader conducting services for every age group imaginable, and Yancy has literally run the entire gamut of enthusiastic diversification.\n\n\u201cI knew from a very young age that God had called me to make music with my life.

Taking key scriptures and truths that I wanted to pass on to my son and make sure he knew and understood the direction and answer these scriptures provide us. As I worked in the studio, I realized that the music was shaping up to be way more than lullabies. Already, when I meet people in my life that are facing big mountains, fears or need answers I\u2019ve been able to use these songs as a way to help strengthen their faith and help them meditate on what God\u2019s Word says.

Lovecraft and the entities of pure cosmic horror that rule that universe he created. Since the new music we were writing was so evil and spacey in sections it seemed to be the right title to fit the overall vibe. But while the lyrical content is largely influenced by such writings, in every allegory there is of course some reflection of the real world, so I enjoy writing in a way that could have one overlaying meaning and then another deeper, symbolic meaning as well.\"\n\nWhile the four members of Revocation - Davidson, guitarist Dan Gargiulio, bassist Brett Bamberger, and drummer Ash Pearson - are spread around North America without the convenience of being able to jam, this does not impinge on the creative process. If anything, this ensures that they make the most of the time spent together, and they maintained an even greater level of quality control than on The Outer Ones predecessors. \"The songs came together pretty naturally, however, this album has the most revisions to riffs and song structures that we've ever had. I had a lot of material written, and had a good amount of time to work on it between tours, so I used that time to really dissect every part of each song. I might be feeling one riff one day and then the next day have some sort of revelation and would go in a totally different direction. All of those revisions definitely benefitted the final product.\" True to Davidson's promise that it is their most death metal release, its abrasiveness is evident on first exposure to both devout followers and those new to Revocation. Destroying all comers with opener \"Of Unworldly Origin\", the fury that seethes through this and the tracks that follow is palpable, and much of it makes for deeply uncomfortable yet always compelling listening. A potent uneasiness bleeds through the swirling, slashing violence of the title track, while the unrelenting edginess and creeping threat of \"That Which Consumes All Things\" marks it as one of the most demanding yet essential additions to Revocation's arsenal. \"I think that that element is a natural product of where I'm at as a musician,\" Davidson says. \"I love the sound of dissonance, and as a songwriter for a metal band I can really play with different textures of tension and figure out how to achieve unexpected releases of that tension. Dissonance doesn't mean that it can't also be melodic, so I always try to think about that when composing. Given the dark direction I wanted to take the album in, it made sense to explore more abrasive harmonies and textures.\" In many ways, these harmonies and textures draw from jazz as much as they do metal. When not focusing on Revocation, Davidson in fact devotes much of his time to studying the language of jazz, and the influence of this is more prominent than on their previous records. While this contributes to many of the record's more coarse elements it also results in moments of sublime melody, and no more so than on the towering instrumental \"Ex Nihilo\". Furthermore, those drawn to the more epic tendencies of Revocation are certain to not be disappointed by The Outer Ones, and ambitious closer \"A Starless Darkness\" takes influence from a variety of sources but ultimately stands in a league of its own. \"When it was coming together I knew I wanted to make it the album closer. The intro/outro is influenced by Gorguts and Morbid Angel, other parts were inspired by Ihsahn's writing on his solo records, especially the verse riff with the shifting contrapuntal guitar octaves. When the bridge section hits it sounds like something that could be on 'Chaos Of Forms' (2011), and then it kind of reminds me of Megadeth, but if 'Rust In Peace' was more of a death metal album.\"\n\nWhile other heavy bands who demonstrate their devotion to the works of H.P. Lovecraft in their lyrics struggle to truly evoke the spirit and atmosphere of his works, this was not an issue for Davidson. For example, drawing influence from the short story \"The Dreams In The Witch House\", as well as other folklore surrounding witches and black magic, \"Of Unworldly Origin\" is \"essentially about an individual who is tracking down a sorceress to finally put an end to her witchery, but ends up getting hexed and driven insane by her magic.\" The short story \"The Colour Out Of Space\" provides the inspiration for \"That Which Consumes All Things\", a unique inclusion in the author's canon in that rather than an actual monster, the creature of the story is an amorphous living cloud that devours life. \"I thought a dark ethereal force that drains the life of all beings would be perfect fodder for a metal song, plus the verse riff sounds like a black cloud descending upon a village. If music can conjure a specific image it's best to try to represent that in the lyrics as well, to make an even stronger statement.\" Not every track draws such direct influence, and \"Fathomless Catacombs\" is a tale of Davidson's own creation. \"It's about three grave robbers that break into an old cathedral in search of riches in the crypts below. However, the tombs are cursed and damn anyone that disturbs them to an eternity of wandering the cryptic labyrinth.\" Suited to the epic feel and scope of the music, \"A Starless Darkness\" goes beyond the sci-fi/horror themes that inform most of the record, and looks instead to theoretical physics, while retaining an ultimately somber subject matter. \"'The heat death of the universe' is the theory that due to dark energy and the expansion of the universe the forces of gravity will eventually become undone. Over the aeons, all stars will burn out and then even black holes will eventually evaporate, leaving the universe frozen and lightless forever.\"\n\nWith producer Shane Frisby (The Ghost Inside, Bury Your Dead) tracking the drums at Brick HitHouse and longtime collaborator Zeuss (Hatebreed, Bleeding Through) handling all other aspects of recording at Planet Z, the record came together easily. \"There wasn't too much input necessary, since we already had the songs mostly fleshed out, but it was good to have them as tie breakers if we had a couple different ideas in mind for one part. They were more there to give us feedback or to encourage us to try different things, like with vocal delivery or things of that nature, and it was great working with them.\" While legendary guitarist Marty Friedman contributed a solo to \"The Exaltation\" on Great Is Our Sin, this time around the work is entirely the province of the four members, not requiring anyone else's input, and they are determined that The Outer Ones is the record that once and for all establishes them as a headlining band. \"We had so many great support offers from the likes of The Black Dahlia Murder and Cattle Decapitation, we didn't get the chance to headline on the last cycle. With this album, we're coming right out of the gate with back-to-back headline tours with full production. We want to really give our fans a show, and we're looking forward to fulfilling that goal.\"", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8969944.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.638097, 38.23695], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Death Metal, Thrash Metal", "OtherInfo": "Revocation, Voivod", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The Phoenix Theater"}, {"Address": "201 Washington St, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Psycroptic", "ArtistBio": "Isolation can often result in unique outcomes.

Seminal. Iconoclasts. A \"band's band\". These are the nebulous words that sum up a group of artists now in their third decade of collaboration and creation. These terms are yokes that Voivod must bear. Yet there is a purity in this fate that will live forever. What were the odds in the first place? Four young men in Quebec, addled by art, high on hash, fueled by Venom and Motorhead. Post-heavy metal, pre-MTV. The 80s were upon them and the threat of nuclear war seemed almost inevitable. Why not live out the endtimes sipping absinthe, writing music, and donning leather and spikes? Michel Langevin conceived a universe, a character, an anti-hero; The Voivod. Dressed in fanciful garb woven by Bram Stoker and Stanley Kubrick, the Voivod was a vampire lord in a post-nuclear age. Immortal and unstoppable. The ultimate goal of any artist. Michel chose to take on the powers of his creation by breathing life into the Voivod's universe. By creating a musical vehicle for the Voivod's saga. By starting a garage band. Denis D'amour provided the music. The young man nicknamed \"Piggy\" composed a debut album of brutal power, metallic ferocity, mad jazz-shifts, and brash noise. He also began to develop an almost lunatic style with his chords, solos, and tones that combined the technicality of Robert Fripp with the lumbering heaviness of Tony Iommi. Piggy worked hard to develop \"Away\", \"Blacky\", and \"Snake\" into a formidable unit. And he succeeded. Local shows and early tape trading led to interest from labels as far away as Los Angeles. Brian Slagel used his independent label Metal Blade to discover and develop important underground artists like Metallica, Slayer, Celtic Frost, ...and Voivod. Compilation tracks led to contracts and a modest budget allowing for time in a Montreal 8-track studio. The first Voivod album War and Pain was recorded and released unto the world in the prophetic year of 1984. More albums followed and tours too. Voivod began to find a worldwide fanbase of rabid metalheads who couldn't get enough of the violent sound on War and Pain and it's follow-up Roooaaarrr. Away painted graphic images of future warriors and weaponry to adorn the covers of these records that matched his lyrical concepts. Snake hideously sputtered these words, shrieking over the \"blower bass\" foundation laid by Blacky. A successful U.S. tour in 1986 with Celtic Frost led to greater interest, and greater vistas. Combat/Noise records signed Voivod and sent them to Berlin to record with Kreator producer Harris Johns. As the band aged and grew, so did its abilities and ideas continue to develop exponentially. The third outing Killing Technology was a paradigm shift beyond its predecessors that nearly no one expected. Now the Voivod character was a cyborg in outer space that had survived multiple nuclear wars and was prepared to take on the tyrrany of a totalitarian world. More sophisticated lyrics demanded more intricate music, which the band was now competent to provide thanks to their many travels. But listeners were not spared an ounce of brutality. Sharper focus. More deadly riffs. An evil sound commenced that to this day is as alien and effective as it was in 1987. MTV and the music industry at large could not ignore the thrash metal demographic any longer. Too many records were being sold and too much money was going directly into the underground scene that could be turned into larger corporate dollars. Even independent, progressive bands were encouraged to streamline their look and sound. Whether you want to call it \"selling out\" or just refer to it as \"general improvements\", it was a fact of life for any band on the cusp of quitting their day jobs to make music for a living. Album four - Dimension Hatross arrived with the best sound production of any 'Vod album to date, and a surprisingly tuneful performance by Snake. Add these interstellar harmonies to the barrage of vintage guitar sounds, unrelenting double-kick drum, and a concept that took the Voivod to a microgalaxy of his own creation, and you find yourself listening to a masterpiece. Over and over again. Even with the anti-entropic rising popularity of each release, Voivod still were far from a household name. The macro-solution to this mega-problem? Sign with MCA for three records and a commercial apex that may never come again. Nothingface became the bands best and best-selling album, featuring flawless digital production, a newfound restraint in tempos and arrangements, and a more thoughtful, poetic lyrical approach. If you have not heard Voivod, this is the place to start. The tours that followed became the stuff of legend. A support slot for Canadian metal arena heroes Rush. A stateside club tour with newcomers Faith No More and Soundgarden. A constant rotation of the album's first single \"Astronomy Domine\" (a tour de force reworking of the Syd Barrett/Pink Floyd classic) on MTV's Headbanger's Ball didn't hurt either. But after such dizzy heights are so nearly reached, a fall becomes inevitable. By 1991, there was pressure for Voivod to be better yet. MCA's definition of better was to cut out the most demanding elements, tone down the metal, and work with a name producer. During the Angel Rat sessions, tensions flared. The opportunity existed for Voivod to create a masterwork which might move their music into a new field entirely. From progressive metal to progressive rock. The Voivod character had been abandoned, and so had many of the most recognizable elements from previous albums. With the right combination of events and people, this might have been an album to rival Nothingface which was so unique and perfect and uncompromising. But, not unlike Brian Wilson's failed attempt to create a masterpiece of Smile, that combination of events did not transpire. Blacky quit the group, ending a stunningly artistic first period in the group's history. The following album \"The Outer Limits\" and its tours would require session bass players to fill the gap he left. The Outer Limits succeeds in all of the areas in which Angel Rat failed, except for one: nothing ever broke the band to a mainstream audience. Chalk it up to internal and external pressures, the dual ghettos of the prog-rock and metal crossroads where the Voivod dwelt, and the untimely explosion of Grunge and Alternative. It was all these elements and more that created a band more resigned to its fate. That realization, along with a healthy severance budget from MCA, made it possible for the band to create a lasting work of art, possibly its last for a corporate sponsor. From the jagged crush of \"Lost Machine\" to the 17-minute opus \"Jack Luminous\", The Outer Limits is a rich jazz/metal journey into psychedelic spatial realms, that manages to retain melody and pop sensibilities without compromise. Silence yawned over the Voivod camp for some time. Their \"Iron Gang\" fan club had long since disbanded. Founding member and vocalist Snake had departed after the TOL tours, despite evidence of a growing audience of Angel Rat fans who were beginning to discover the rest of the band's catalog. Away and Piggy were left holding the reins of their creation. But truly, Away was responsible for the concept, the artwork, the drive. And Piggy wrote much of the music. By the mid-90s, an underground metal scene was brewing once more. A scene for which Voivod was as influential and responsible as their metal heroes had been to them. Enter Eric Forrest and Slipdisc records. The best solution for filling two vacancies? Hire one man. Forrest's abilities on the 4-string as well as the strength of his voice provided the perfect match for a leaner, hungrier Voivod. With digital recording costs dropping throughout the industry, independent money for a record became a viable solution, particularly for a trio with more direct ambitions. Negatron was not an album so much as an experiment. Michel \"Away\" Langevin, Dennis \"Piggy\" Damour, and Eric Forrest went in the studio without a concept, and jammed. The results were cruder and more aggressive than any previous recording, yet retained a sonic excellence and truly modern sensibility that placed them less in the prog-metal camp, aligning the group closer to groups like Neurosis and Brutal Truth. Extensive Negatron tours followed, and the world began to realize that the Voivod still lived. Forrest was capturing the nuances of Snake's vocal style, while alternatingly flooring or alienating fans with his own death metal approach. What subtlety from the MCA era had been lost was more than balanced by the returned aggression from the Noise years. Now it was time for the Voivod to return. Phobos woke the creature from its nothing-faced slumber; pitting him in a global war. Even heavier than Negatron, this record blankets the listener in a cloud of analog sound, thick and almost stifling. More psychedelic than Angel Rat, heavier than Killing Technology, Phobos was a Dimension Hatross for the 90s and the most vital work the band had produced since Nothingface. Fate struck one more blow when a tire blow-out turned the tour van over on the German slopes of the Phobos tour. Eric Forrest was nearly killed, surviving to endure multiple major surgeries, and permanent injury to his legs and back. Amazingly, Eric weathered rigorous rehabilitation and physical therapy, and recommenced Voivod tour with co-headliners Neurosis and support compliments of Today is the Day. Eric sang, played bass, and walked with a cane to be in the band he loved. But to the dismay of some (and the relief of others), Eric eventually was asked to stepped down. Enter the present day. A new light and life has entered the Voivod camp. Snake has returned to sing after a seven year hiatus and the aborted Union Made project. Longtime friend and fan Jason Newsted (ex-Metallica) will be producing and filling bass duties on the sequel to Phobos. And this album will be the final chapter in the epic story of the vampire lord Away created in his mind as a child. The Voivod must go to war with his god before his final eternal rest. With new superstar member Jasonic in the fold, the possibilities for the future of Voivod continue to multiply. Newsted has been playing progressive thrash music since his Flotsam & Jetsom days, before going on to join and then leave the most popular metal band in the world. His legendary status is undeniable, but so is his love and respect for Voivod. As a man who could literally be involved in any musical project he could imagine, he has chosen this band for a new foundation. And his own Chophouse Records label will be the new roof over their heads. It is an exciting time to be a Voivod fan. Too few bands continue to create such relevant music so far into their career.

And while his dazzling technique on both acoustic and electric guitars has afforded him regal status among hordes of frettboard aficionados who regularly flock to his concerts, the depth of Di Meola's writing and compositions along with the soulfulness of his guitar expressions, have won him legions of fans worldwide.\n\nA pioneer of blending world music and jazz, going back to early Latin-tinged fusion outings like 1976's Land of the Midnight Sun, 1977's Elegant Gypsy and 1978's Casino, the guitar great has continued to explore the rich influence of flamenco, tango, Middle Eastern, Brazilian and African music throughout his long career.\n\nDi Meola\u2019s most recent release, 2013\u2019s \"All Your Life\", was an acoustic tour de force that had him revisiting the music of a seminal influence \u2013 The Beatles. \u201cI really credit the Beatles for the reason why I play guitar,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a major catalyst for me to want to learn music. So their impact was pretty strong.\u201d A virtual one-man show of virtuosity, it features the guitar great interpreting 14 familiar Beatles tunes in the stripped-down setting of strictly acoustic guitar. All the tracks are imbued with the guitarist\u2019s signature flamenco flourishes, intricate arpeggiating and dazzling cross-picking. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, where the Beatles created most of their records during their heyday, \"All Your Life\" stands as a triumph in the long and illustrious career of a bona fide guitar hero. \u201cI\u2019ve come full circle with this,\u201d says Di Meola. \u201cI started out my life loving the Beatles, and I never stopped, just like a lot of so many other guitarists from my generation. In the middle, we all went into whatever music we pursued in our careers -- fusion, jazz, whatever it might be. We all wanted to further our craft. But when you come back to the Beatles\u2019 music, it\u2019s like; \u201cMan, this stuff is still happening! All of it!\u201d\n\nDi Meola's ongoing fascination with complex rhythmic syncopation combined with provocative lyrical melodies and sophisticated harmony has been at the heart of his music throughout a celebrated career that has earned him critical accolades, three gold albums and more than six million in record sales worldwide. He has been particularly enamored over the past 20 years by the tango music of the late great Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla, whose compositions he has interpreted over time, beginning with 1990's Di Meola Plays Piazzolla, continuing to 1993's Heart of the Immigrants, 2002's Flesh on Flesh and right up to 2007's Diabolic Inventions and Seduction for Solo Guitar.\n\"Piazzolla had a profound effect on my development as a musician and as a person,\u201d says Al. \u201cWe became close friends, often communicating by mail. And during the course of this friendship my admiration and desire to learn more about this great man intensified.\u201d\n\nA native of New Jersey who still resides in the Garden State along with a home in Miami, Di Meola was born in Jersey City on July 22, 1954. Growing up in Bergenfield with the music of Elvis Presley, The Ventures and The Beatles, he naturally gravitated to guitar as a youngster and by his early teens was already an accomplished player. Attaining such impressive skills at such a young age didn't come easy for Al but rather was the result of focused dedication and intensive periods of woodshedding between his junior and senior years in high school. \u201cI used to practice the guitar eight to ten hours a day,\u201d he told DownBeat. \u201cAnd I was trying to find myself, or find the kind of music that suited where I was going with the guitar.\u201d\n\nIn 1971, Al enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and by the second semester began playing in a fusion quartet led by keyboardist Barry Miles. A gig tape of that band was later passed on to Chick Corea by a friend of Al's, and in the early part of 1974 the 19-year-old guitarist was tapped to join the fusion super group as a replacement for guitarist Bill Connors. \u201cI was just sitting around my apartment in Boston on a Friday afternoon when Chick called and asked me to come to a rehearsal in New York,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI couldn't believe it. But in 10 minutes I packed some clothes in a bag, got a ride to New York and never saw that apartment in Boston again.\u201d\n\nFollowing a weekend of rehearsals with Chick, Stanley Clarke and Lenny White, Di Meola made his Return to Forever debut at Carnegie Hall on July 3, 1974, officially launching his career into the stratosphere. \"Playing with Chick in Return To Forever was the first significant step in my development as a player,\u201d says Al. After three landmark recordings with Return To Forever \u2013 1974's Where Have I Known You Before, 1975's Grammy Award winning No Mystery and 1976's Romantic Warrior \u2013 the group disbanded and Al subsequently started up his career as a solo artist.\n\nHis 1976 debut as a leader, Land of the Midnight Sun, was a blazing showcase of his signature chops and Latin-tinged compositions that featured a stellar cast including drummers Steve Gadd and Lenny White, bassist Anthony Jackson and Jaco Pastorius, keyboardists Jan Hammer, Barry Miles and Chick Corea, and percussionist Mingo Lewis. Over the course of six more albums with Columbia Records \u2013 Elegant Gypsy, Casino, Splendido Hotel, Electric Rendezvous, Tour De Force and Scenario \u2013 Al established himself as an influential force in contemporary music.\n\n1980 marked the triumph of the acoustic guitar Trio with Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin. Their debut recording on Columbia Records, Friday Night in San Francisco, became a landmark recording that surpassed the two million mark in sales. The following year, 1981, Di Meola was inducted into Guitar Player\u2019s Gallery of Greats after four consecutive wins as Best Jazz Guitarist in the magazine\u2019s Readers Poll. The three virtuosos in the Trio toured together from 1980 through 1983, releasing the studio album Passion, Grace & Fire in 1982. In 1995, they reunited for a third recording, Guitar Trio, follow by another triumphant world tour. In early 1996, Di Meola formed a new trio with the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and RTF band mate Stanley Clarke called The Rite of Strings. Their self-titled debut was released in 1995. Di Meola subsequently recorded with the likes of opera superstar Luciano Pavarotti, pop stars Paul Simon and Dave Matthews, classical guitarist Manuel Barrueco, Japanese jazz pianist Yutaka Kobayashi and Italian pop star Pino Daniele. Over the course of his career, he has also worked and recorded with Phil Collins, Carlos Santana, Steve Winwood, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Milton Naciemento, Egberto Gismonti, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Jimmy Page, Steve Vai and Frank Zappa.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, Di Meola invited the great Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba to tour with him on some concert appearances which were greeted by fans with great applause.\n\nNow in early 2015 Di Meola is working on recording his newest album titled; ELYSIUM, and will be touring North America and Europe with many dates already booked.\n\nVisit: http://www.aldimeola.com/#!tour/c9a0\n\nAlbum recordings can be found at:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/al-di-meola/id814570\n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/al-di-meola-mn0000600228/discography\n\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Al+Di+Meola/+albums", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8725426.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.285583, 38.29958], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Jazz Fusion, Jazz Instrument, Fusion, Flamenco", "OtherInfo": "Full Food and Bar Menu Available in all sections PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE - 45 Years On Stage Tour 2019During a 40-plus year career marked by hugely influential recordings and worldwide tours, Di Meola has regenerated the jazz idiom three times over while dedicating himself to his art.

Tracked at Trench Studios (Abysmal Dawn, Exhumed, Hirax, etc.) in California and mixed by Dan Swan\u00f6 at Unisound Studio (Asphyx, Dissection, Bloodbath, etc.), the record\u2019s artwork was created by Dan Seagrave (Entombed, Morbid Angel, Pestilence etc.), to much excitement of vocalist, guitarist and main composer Chris Monroy: \u201cHaving the opportunity to work with Dan Seagrave on the artwork was a dream come true for us, and Dan Swan\u00f6, man he really made our album sound huge and heavy as fuck! It is a true honor to be able to work with these two legends. We can't wait to share it with all the fans of death metal!\u201d To give you a short run down of the band\u2019s history, SKELETAL REMAINS formed as Anthropophagy back in 2011, and released the two much lauded studio albums \u201cBeyond The Flesh\u201d (2012) and \u201cCondemned To Misery\u201d (2015) via German label FDA Rekotz, constantly toured Europe, the US or also Japan, performed at such renowned festivals as Maryland Death Fest, Party.San, Brutal Assault, Obscene Extreme or also Hellfest, and now seek to expand upon that with \u201cDevouring Mortality\u201d. Inspired by acts like early Pestilence, Gorguts, Morbid Angel, and Demolition Hammer, the new record proves to be the band\u2019s most diverse and crushing opus to date and contains a whole lot of outstanding tracks. No matter if it is the scorching first single \u2018Seismic Abyss\u2019, the dynamic \u2018Catastrophic Retribution\u2019, \u2018Parasitic Horrors\u2019 or \u2018Reanimating Pathogen\u2019, SKELETAL REMAINS blend elements of death and thrash metal with blazing solos uniting influences from such a melodic master like James Murphy (Death, Cancer, Obituary, Testament) to the divebombing assault of Rick Rozz (Death, Massacre). \u201cThe album is basically the next step up for us! It\u2019s a bit more technical compared to our first two albums and we have also used seven string guitars for some songs to add a heavier edge at times, but overall it has the same sound and feeling of our previous releases: Old school death metal from the late 80s and early 90s with a little bit of our own taste added to it!\u201d So make sure to listen to \u201cDevouring Mortality\u201d as it might be one of 2018\u2019s finest slabs of death metal and totally lives up to the band\u2019s perspective.

Led by the incomparable singer and songwriter Paul Rodgers, arguably the finest singer in rock 'n ' roll and a huge songwriting talent.\n\nFormed in 1973, Bad Company came to life when Rodgers was looking to start anew after the disintegration of his legendary band Free. His powerhouse vocals and songwriting were a main ingredient during Free's impressive five-year run; a period of time that saw the release of seven extremely influential albums that featured Free's minimalist blues-rock approach. Included among Free's dynamic body of work is the 1970 smash, \"All Right Now,\" one of the most recognizable rock anthems ever recorded. Lyrics and melody by Rodgers. He was Free\u2019s main songwriter.\n\nRodgers had met Mott The Hoople guitarist Mick Ralphs and after jamming together and listening to new songs that Ralphs had penned and songs that Rodgers had penned, Ralphs made the decision to leave Mott and form a new band with Rodgers. The duo recruited former King Crimson bassist/vocalist Boz Burrell, added drummer Simon Kirke and christened themselves Bad Company, the name inspired by Rodgers. Rodgers\u2019 brought in Led Zeppelin manager Peter Grant and Bad Company became the first band signed to Zeppelin's Swan Song label. \"I had to fight to get the management and the record company to accept the name Bad Company,\" explains Rodgers. \"They thought it was a terrible name. Peter Grant called a meeting and the band met beforehand. I told them that I had been through this before with Free as Island Records had wanted to call us the Heavy Metal Kids. We agreed to go in and tell them that we were going to be called Bad Company and that was the end of the story. As soon as Peter heard how strongly I felt about the name, he became very supportive and he and I turned the record company around.\"", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8990726.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.264272, 38.348684], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Classic Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Silverado Resort and Spa"}, {"Address": "4117 Judah St, San Francisco, USA", "Artist": "Fig", "ArtistBio": "Fig, is an up and coming Hip-Hop artist originally from Southern California.

Dylan Schneider is wise beyond his years, especially when it comes to his songwriting. But perhaps even more impressive is Schneider\u2019s ability and willingness to connect with fans on a personal level. \u201cI used to freak out if an artist would respond or interact with me. It\u2019s incredibly important to me that I do the same with my fans.\u201d That love for fans has helped grow Schneider a collective social following of over 1,000,000. Named \u201ccountry music\u2019s next rising star\u201d by Billboard, the 18-year-old has spent the better part of the last two years becoming the epitome of the modern country artist.\n\u200d\nSince his debut EP in 2016, Dylan continues to impact the country charts with every release that follows. Schneider\u2019s latest EP, potlight\u2019s On Yo hit the No.1 spot on the iTunes Country Album Charts. Dylan recently toured as direct support for Chris Lane and Granger Smith, and is currently headlining his own tour, selling out shows across the United States and the UK.\n\u200d\nSchneider and his fans have taken over the country music conversation digitally, with a rapidly growing 57 million total streams on Spotify and 32 million video views. His current radio single, \u201cHow Does It Sound,\u201d is nearing 13 million streams, evidencing the consumer demand for the track. Each release finds Schneider surpassing his peers and connecting with his listeners in a meaningful way, strengthening the foundation he has been building for years.\n\u200d\nWith impressive projects in the works, Schneider\u2019s focus remains the importance of the fan. \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m nothing without my fans. When I write, I\u2019m thinking, \u2018how is this song going to sing live, and how will the audience react and identify?\u2019 What I do, most importantly, is for my fans. My job is to connect and show them a good time.\u201d Whether it\u2019s his natural ability to write a genuine song or his ability to produce viral content, one thing is certain; the world wants more Dylan Schneider.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8581122.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.080678, 37.426767], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Country", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Shoreline Amphitheatre"}, {"Address": "2087 Addison St, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Jenny Scheinman", "ArtistBio": "She grew up on a homestead in Northern California in a family of folk musicians, studied at Oberlin Conservatory, graduated with a degree in English literature from UC Berklee, and has been performing since she was a teenager.

Lucky for Big Loud Records breakout artist Morgan Wallen, that quality runs in his blood. With his debut album, IF I KNOW ME, the hit maker behind \u201cUp Down\u201d (ft. Florida Georgia Line) and \u201cThe Way I Talk\u201d lays his cards out on the table: Work hard. Love hard. Party down. Respect the past and make your own future. ... Know yourself. \u201cI\u2019ve never been the type of person who\u2019s goodat getting my feelings out, so for me music is a way to do that,\u201d Wallen explains. \u201cI just hope people get to know me and see my true colors.\u201dStill only 24 years old, those colors have already started to show. Working with a vocal blend which marks the spot where interstate blacktop changes over to gravelly, Smoky Mountain backroads, Wallen\u2019s a rock and hip-hop loving country boy with a sound straight out of the modern South. He mixes boondock bangers, amped-up anthems and sensitive, shade-tree poetry like a one-man playlist. He\u2019s a fireball onstage, thrilling stadium crowds with superstars like Florida Georgia Line and Luke Bryan and headlining his own 2018 Up Down Tour. He\u2019s a chart-topping songwriter with his name on tracks like Jason Aldean\u2019s \u201cYou Make It Easy,\u201d a Grand Ole Opry performer and an artist on the fast track with over 100 million Spotify streams, earning the respect of legends like Bill Anderson and country\u2019s new generation at the same time.Born and raised in the tiny, two-stoplight town of Sneedville, Tennessee, Wallen began singing in his father\u2019s church at 3 years old and was writing songs by 18, melding a variety of influences right from the start. Sneedville is the home of bluegrass icon Jimmy Martin and Wallen went to the same highschool as Kenny Chesney. But while his mother loved Christian music and he was into rap, his dad was a hard rocker all the way \u2013laying the foundation for his son\u2019s own fearless creative identity.\u201cIt\u2019s not something you would expect \u2013a Southern Baptistpreacher who loves Bad Company \u2013but I think that\u2019s part of what makes him genuine,\u201d Wallen explains. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the kind of preacher who was throwing judgment toward anybody. He just found a way that helped him and he wanted to help other people, and if he liked a little rock-and-roll, then so be it. I looked up to it all.\u201dThat willingness to break the mold peppers IF I KNOW ME, filled with equal parts confident charm and heartfelt vulnerability. Wallen co-wrote 6 of the album\u2019s 14 tracks, working with established country hit makers like Craig Wiseman and Jessi Alexander, up and comers like\nMichael Hardy and crossover-rap tunesmiths like Ernest K. and Ryan Vojtesak (Kanye West, Young Thug, Post Malone).Produced by studio ace Joey Moi \u2013who also helped FGL, Jake Owen and Nickelback develop their bold sonic presence \u2013Morgan didn\u2019t bother trying to classify his work by genre. Instead he focused on feel, with swagger and sensitivity, heartbreak and desire all taking their place.\u201cLike a lot of people my age, I didn\u2019t necessarily grow up listening to country music ... I grew up living it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe songs I wrote came from the heart, and I don\u2019t really pay attention to what\u2019s going on outside of what I\u2019m doing. I just try to stick to what I know and what I love.\u201dWith the album\u2019s slow-burning title track, what Wallen knows and loves comes into view. Anchored by a tight, Top 40 club beat and a gotta-have-you theme, the song is all rhythm and quick hitting come-ons as Wallen looks to start a romance that lasts longer than just one night.\u201cIt\u2019s perfect for my first album,\u201d Wallen says. \u201cLike, \u2018If I know me, then here\u2019s what you get.\u2019\u201dHis anthemic 2016 breakout, \u201cThe Way I Talk,\u201d takes a drawling look at putting your money where your mouth is, while \u201cUp Down\u201d \u2013the irresistible thumper that features Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley of Florida Georgia Line \u2013feels like typical Friday in Wallen\u2019s mountain-valley hometown. Climbing up country radio, SiriusXM and digital streaming charts alike, it\u2019s full of distorted twang, pounding drums, sly vocals and references to \u201cHoldin\u2019 it down here in \u2018B.F.E.\u2019\u201d\u201cSome people have asked me, \u2018What\u2019s B.F.E.?\u2019 And if you don\u2019t know, you just don\u2019t know,\u201d Wallen says with a laugh. \u201cI love a good time, I love to drink a little bit, I love being with my friends and I love fishing. Life is hard enough already, so if you can find a song that takes you away from that for three or four minutes, it\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\u201cHad Me at Halftime\u201d scores with a heartfelt Hail Mary, \u201cIf I Ever Get You Back\u201d updates the feel-good spirit of \u201890s country, and \u201cRedneck Love Song\u201d grooves with ablue-collar promise of everlasting love.Meanwhile, \u201cHappy Hour\u201d toasts a relationship that was doomed from the start, mixing on-the-rocks lyrics and melodies into a potent, pure-country anthem. \u201cChasin\u2019 You\u201d smolders with the residual heat of a top-shelf bourbon, and \u201cWhiskey Glasses\u201d fuses sludgy guitars to a concept that\u2019s basically a low-down, broken-hearted play on the idea behind beer goggles. But with its booming beat, swampy guitars and sideways lyrics all about the country-boy good life \u2013plus a nod to Nitty Gritty Dirt Band\u2019s archetypal country-rocker, \u201cFishin\u2019 in the Dark\u201d \u2013\u201cWhatcha Know About That\u201d lies at the album\u2019s thematic heart. It\u2019s a place where being true to yourself is more important than playing by someone else\u2019s rules. And that\u2019s something Wallen knows all about.\u201cThe song pays homage to the past, but I\u2019m damn near rapping in part of it,\u201d he explains, honored that the Grammy-winning Dirt Band \u2013envelope pushing game changers in their own right \u2013gave the track their support. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I love about country music right now. You get to express yourself and do what you want, and I think that\u2019s why country is bigger now than it ever has been.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8882755.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.080678, 37.426767], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Country", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Shoreline Amphitheatre"}, {"Address": "1558 Canyon Rd, Moraga, CA 94556", "Artist": "LL&PFP", "ArtistBio": "Just two nice guys trying to express their softer side while chasing down their next beer, wine, or Jameson & coffee.

With pristine vocals and a knack for writing clever yet relatable songs about looking for, finding and losing love, Dan + Shay bring a youthful sense of energy to country music. Their debut album, Where It All Began, harnesses that energy with 12 radio-ready tracks.\n\nThe album\u2019s title comes from the last line of their debut hit single, \u201c19 You + Me,\u201d which, upon its release, had the biggest first week by a new duo in trade publication Country Aircheck\u2019s history, was the most added debut of 2013 at country radio and was certified Gold by the RIAA. The harmony-rich song reinvents the popular theme of nostalgia through a flurry of evocative imagery: you were California beautiful, I was playing everything but cool; it was everything we wanted it to be, the summer of 19 You + Me.\n\n\u201c'19 You + Me\u2019 is where it all began, and those words are the last you hear in that song. It felt appropriate for our first album,\u201d says Shay, a native of Natural Dam, Ark.\n\n\u201cThese 12 songs really define us,\u201d adds Dan, who grew up in suburban Pittsburgh. The pair first met during a late-night jam session at Dan\u2019s Nashville home. \u201cThey\u2019re honest, and this whole project started with Shay and I writing songs together. That\u2019s how we met. Where It All Began is the story of who we are, who we were and who we\u2019re going to be.\u201d\n\nAlready Academy of Country Music Award nominees for Vocal Duo of the Year, Dan + Shay are following in the footsteps of their perennially lauded influences Rascal Flatts, Keith Urban and Tim McGraw. And the sing-along songs that make up Where It All Began evoke the sound of those artists, along with a healthy dose of \u201890s rock and R&B.\n\nBut it\u2019s the album\u2019s writing that truly distinguishes Where It All Began. Dan + Shay wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on the record and bring an educated yet hip slant to country lyrics. \u201cWe just love songwriting,\u201d says Dan, who produced the album along with Danny Orton and Scott Hendricks. \u201cWe wanted it to be a rollercoaster of emotions and a rollercoaster of sounds, something that takes listeners on a journey. We want people to fall in love with the album from front to back.\u201d\n\nFrom the introductory whistles of opening track \u201cShow You Off,\u201d it\u2019s easy to go along for the ride. The duo\u2019s favorite to perform live, the album opener instantly identifies Shay as one of country\u2019s best young vocalists. His pliable voice soars along to Dan\u2019s deft guitar lines and the result is musical alchemy. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in love with somebody,\u201d Dan says of the song\u2019s message, \u201cyou\u2019re infatuated with them and you want to be seen with them everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe inspiration for \u201cStop, Drop + Roll\u201d came from a rather unlikely source: the Stephen King horror film \u201cThe Mist,\u201d which the guys were watching late one night. When a character burst into flames, Dan quipped that he needed to \u201cstop, drop and roll,\u201d and the likeminded duo knew right away that it was a song. \u201cWe paused the movie and literally wrote it right then and there,\u201d laughs Shay.\n\nSuch anecdotes are proof that inspiration can strike at any time for a songwriter.\n\n\u201cWhat I love about the vibe that Dan and I have is we don\u2019t worry about what we say,\u201d continues Shay, citing album cuts like the intimate \u201cCan\u2019t Say No\u201d and the bittersweet \u201cFirst Time Feeling.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re writing, you can\u2019t be scared to say anything.\u201d\n\nAnything or everything. One of the gifts that reveals itself upon repeated listenings to Where It All Began is Dan + Shay\u2019s lyrical attention to detail. Songs such as \u201cNothing Like You\u201d paint a picture in the minutiae, with lines about purple untied shoestrings and stacks of books.\n\n\u201cLyrics don\u2019t have to be cookie-cutter or straight down the middle,\u201d says Dan.\n\nBut it does help if they\u2019re conducive to group choruses, which the duo found out firsthand when touring with Hunter Hayes.\n\n\u201cWe played \u2018Show You Off\u2019 for 10,000 people with Hunter Hayes and they all were singing the \u2018ay oh\u2019 chorus back to us,\u201d recalls Shay. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d\n\nFollowing a tour with Hunter, the guys will be joining Blake Shelton on his Ten Times Crazier Tour this summer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re such huge fans of these artists,\u201d says Dan, \u201cthat it\u2019s crazy to imagine that they believe in us enough to take us out on the road. We\u2019re thrilled to introduce new fans to the music of Where It All Began.\u201d\n\nEarning an RIAA Gold certification for a hit single, going on tour with Blake, being nominated for an ACM\u2014they\u2019re all milestones that have become a part of the Dan + Shay story. And with the release of the hotly anticipated Where It All Began, the most exciting chapter is about to be written.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8430668.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.080678, 37.426767], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Country", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Shoreline Amphitheatre"}, {"Address": "453, 1st St E, Sonoma, CA 95476", "Artist": "Notorious", "ArtistBio": "Notorious is renowned California based dance band that is consistently recognized as one of the best groups in the country for weddings (and social events) by Martha Stewart Weddings, Modern Bride, The Knot and many other blogs, websites and wedding professionals (Hey, thank you!).", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8015679.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.45698, 38.292719], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: 80s, 70s, Current Hits 60s, Decades, 90s", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Valley of the Moon Festival, Sonoma Plaza"}, {"Address": "1111 California St, San Francisco, CA 94108", "Artist": "Glen Hansard", "ArtistBio": "It is July 2017, and Glen Hansard is sick and wandering the streets of Paris.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long spell on the road. Barely two weeks have passed since he wrapped up a support tour for Pearl Jam front man Eddie Vedder, and more than five years have gone by since there was a month when he wasn\u2019t on stage. Not to mention the albums: Rhythm and Repose (2012), the Grammy-nominated Didn\u2019t He Ramble (2015), and a soon to be released Between Two Shores (2018); a bevy of EPs; and to top it off, a five week \u201cCamino by sea\u201d in a traditional Irish naomho\u0301g, a journey which was captured on film and released as the full-length The Camino Voyage (2018).\n\nHe has earned both his exhaustion and now his respite: a month in one place. Taking a residency at the Centre Culturel Irlandais, Hansard has come to France to put shape to a new album. The intention is to create \u201can acoustic record with sparse accompaniment\u201d in concert with long-time friends and collaborators Joe Doyle (bass), ROMY (piano, string arrangements, and vocals), and Javier Mas (Spanish guitar, lau\u0301d).\n\nParis, however, has other plans. One night at dinner, friend, author, and classical singer Judith Mok introduces Hansard to the Khoshravesh brothers, who studied classical and traditional music in their native Iran before relocating to Paris. The simple meal quickly turns into a session. Hansard recalls working through one song particularly. \u201cThe Khoshravesh brothers joined me and I was transported. The song took on a new depth: I heard it differently, and new possibilities emerged. The ease by which they followed their own melodic line while being sympathetic to mine was intoxicating.\u201d By the end of the night, the brothers agreed to join Hansard in Black Box studios, where he will be working with producer David Odlum, and what was to be a straightforward album begins to take an interesting turn.\n\nThe roster of musicians quickly increases. Along with Joe Doyle, Romy, and the Khoshravesh brothers, Hansard invites Dublin electronic musicians Dunk Murphy (Sunken Foal) and Deasy to participate in the sessions, eager to see what might spark from the diverse range of musical traditions. Each day is unwritten, defined by an openness, a willingness to follow the spirit of the moment wherever it may lead. \u201cWhen you surround yourself with great musicians and do your best to keep up, stay loose, give little direction, and allow everyone to bring what they bring, something transformative may happen,\u201d Hansard says.\n\nOver the next few months, more musicians cycle in: Graham Hopkins and Earl Harvin (drums, percussion), Michael Buckley (saxophone, horns and flute), Breannda\u0301n O\u0301 Beaglaoich (accordion), Rosie McKenzie (violin), Aida Shahghasemi (Iranian singer and daf player), Eamon O\u2019Leary (banjo, bouzouki, and mandolin), Anna Roberts-Gevalt, (fiddle), Bri\u0301an Mac Gloinn (Ye Vagabonds, fiddle), Marke\u0301ta Irglova\u0301 (vocals), and Rob Moose (strings arrangements). They work with no agenda, no preconceived notion of what the sessions will turn into. But by April, it\u2019s clear that an album has emerged from this group exercise. \u201cSometimes,\u201d says Hansard, \u201cwhen you take a small musical fragment and you care for it, follow it and build it up slowly, it can become a thing of wonder.\u201d\n\nThe resulting album, This Wild Willing (April 12, ANTI- Records), is indeed a collection of wondrous things.\nThose who have followed Hansard\u2019s career since his Academy Award winning turn in the film Once will have witnessed one artistic arc: the journey of a Dublin busker who cut his teeth on the greats - Dylan, Van Morrison, Leonard Cohen \u2013 and followed the path of the troubadour, the singer-songwriter to great effect.\n\nBut there is another thread running through Glen Hansard\u2019s musicianship. In his decades as lead singer of Irish stalwarts The Frames, rock and folk ambitions coexist with moments of strangeness, intimacy, and stillness: love songs drowning in the last fevers of the Spanish Flu (\u201cSanta Maria\u201d), protagonists who ponder throwing it all away and disappearing in a fugue state (\u201cKeepsake\u201d). And above all, the band, veering from silence to cacophony, ready to underpin soaring emotional and dynamic shifts.\nThis Wild Willing marks an inflection point in his career, a turning where he marries the sonic inventiveness of the best of his work in The Frames to the discipline he\u2019s found as a lyricist in his solo career.\n\nIt is an album guided and formed by the twin totems of resolve and surrender \u2013 the resolve to see a thing through alongside a willingness to surrender, to trust in that which lies outside yourself \u2013 the other musicians in the room, your lover, your healer, your audience.\n\nLead track \u201cI\u2019ll Be You Be Me\u201d finds Hansard weighing the risks of such vulnerability, of the giving of oneself to another. His restrained vocal belies the fury of the underlying instrumental\u2019s building storm. \u201cI\u2019ll be you, be me and I\u2019ll be you/I\u2019ll take your truth, your lies, your secrets,\u201d he sings, negotiating the consuming potential of desire. There is danger here, but it is without rancor or ill-will \u2013 the danger of a hare with its belly exposed. There is also a duality in the invitation: the audience is drawn in just as surely as the song\u2019s object, to the immersive world conjured by the album.\n\nA sense of unease lingers in the mysterious \u201cClosing Door\u201d and \u201cRace to the Bottom.\u201d The latter serves as a sort of diary of Hansard\u2019s residency in Paris, finding him \u201ccoughing my lungs up on the Rue des Irlandais/becoming a risk to myself\u201d an \u201c\u2019X\u2019 on my back\u201d as he wanders the city. Hansard insists, \u201cIt\u2019s more about the decline of a person or persons rather than of human kind,\u201d and yet it is hard to escape the sense that a collective worry is being tapped into, with the desecration of Joan of Arc in one memorable line echoing the more recent destruction of the statue of Marianne \u2013 that other great symbol of France \u2013 in the unrest that beset the country in the winter of 2018. It is lyric as prognostication, somehow in tune with coming shockwaves.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all darkness, however. \u201cDon\u2019t Settle,\u201d one of the few tracks not recorded in France, retains the raw energy of the various tour sound checks which brought it to life. It offers not warning, but guidance, as it considers paths of original artistic voices -\nShane McGowan, Lisa O\u2019Neill, Woody Guthrie, and James Baldwin to name a few \u2013 and implores younger artists to stay the course. It finds its conclusion on the record\u2019s penultimate track, \u201cGood Life of Song,\u201d summing up the possibility inherent in the bardic path. For Hansard \u201cthere\u2019s joy and sorrow for me in this recording, where they meet is a hallowed spot.\u201d Alongside these is a trio of songs: \u201cBrother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d \u201cMary,\u201d\n\nand, \u201cThreading Water,\u201d each of which is presented so openly that it is easy forget that they are exploring private, intimate territory rarely seen in Hansard\u2019s lyrics. Here is Hansard at home in Ireland, rambling through October, preparing for winter. Here is a declaration of love, a poem put to song. Here is simple gratitude for a good life.\n\nThe album ends with the deceptively simple, \u201cLeave a Light...\u201d Lingering in the melody is the memory of a journey undertaken with friends, those living and those who have sailed on. And in the lyric is a path out, from disorder and discord, into the place where surrender and resolve meet. \u201cSo, say goodbye to the long, cold winter,\u201d Hansard sings, \u201cAnd farewell to all we\u2019ve left behind. Leave a light on and come out of the shadows. You\u2019re the one I\u2019ll come back to find.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8974008.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412938, 37.791183], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Americana", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Masonic"}, {"Address": "1 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043", "Artist": "Florida Georgia Line", "ArtistBio": "Billboard\u2019s first-ever Trailblazer Award recipients continue to build their ever-expanding empire of innovative artistry and entrepreneurial endeavors throughout their colossal career.

His albums are not collections of musical pieces but tales told in a distinctive voice, with a distinct point of view and purpose.\n\u201cThe Little Dream,\u201d the title track of Cuban pianist and composer Alfredo Rodri\u0301guez\u2019s fourth studio album (Mack Avenue Records), gently builds into an uplifting statement \u2013 one that reflects the hope children hold in building a brighter future, where tiny dreams manifest into grandiose realities.\nThere is no better example of this than Rodri\u0301guez\u2019s own personal journey: from his humble beginnings in Cuba to being discovered by Quincy Jones, ultimately leaving his family behind to immigrate to the United States and pursue his own dream. Over the past decade, Rodri\u0301guez has gone from a young local Cuban artist to a globally recognized Grammy\u00ae-nominee with three critically acclaimed releases on Mack Avenue Records: Sounds of Space (2011), The Invasion Parade (2014), and Tocororo (2016).\nOver the years, Rodri\u0301guez\u2019s worldwide tours have shaped his diverse global point of view. \u201cI believe people are more similar than different. We live in a time where we have so many ways to inform ourselves, and yet some places \u2013 and people \u2013 choose to remain isolated. As a result, the world can lack peace and empathy, instead of showing unity and tolerance.\u201d\nIn a time where governments want to build walls instead of bridges, and uplifting programs like DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) are being rescinded, Rodri\u0301guez understands how important \u201cdreams\u201d are, especially for today\u2019s youth \u2013 and the immigrant children known as \u201cDREAMers\u201d \u2013 for shaping a more unified future. He expresses, \u201cthe title of my new album, The Little Dream, is my response to our current world climate. The title comes from my fascination with the dream world, which is a beautiful manifestation of our reality. My greatest dream is one where all humans live happily and in peace. Children are the hope and the answer to creating a world of love, peace, unity and understanding.\u201d\nThe Little Dream was recorded in just two days, with a majority of the songs being done impressively in one take. Rodri\u0301guez explains, \u201cI don\u2019t like perfection in the common sense of the word. For me, perfection is how we react to something initially, and that makes my music better and more honest. The most beautiful thing to me is when I play and the opposite of what I had intended happens, so I have to find a solution while I am playing! Music is like life, it\u2019s about adaption and transformation in the moment.\u201d Rodri\u0301guez\u2019s commitment to improvisation is evident in his popular cover song videos, which have racked up millions of views on his social media channels.\nTwo musicians who join Rodri\u0301guez on The Little Dream and helped shape the album\u2019s sound are Michael Olivera and Munir Hossn. \u201cI\u2019ve been touring and playing with Michael and Munir for the last several years, so The Little Dream is a testimony to the sound we have developed.\u201d\nQuincy Jones continues to serve as producer, and Rodri\u0301guez never stops learning from his teacher. \u201cQuincy always impresses me, and for a young musician, it\u2019s such an incredible opportunity to get to be around a\nlegend. Quincy has affected my life in so many positive ways; he is my mentor, and the most open-minded musician I know. His influence has made me a better person as well as a better musician.\u201d\nAs jazz music sees a resurgence in younger audiences, Rodri\u0301guez is leading the way for the new wave of Cuban musicians, including past collaborators Ibeyi and Pedrito Martinez. The rich musical history of Cuba is finally being exposed to a wider audience, which has always been a hope for many upcoming artists.\nRodri\u0301guez circles back on the title The Little Dream, which he concludes \u201cis about the child that is within us all, and how imagination and creativity are messages for hope. No one knows better than me that a little dream can become a big dream, and big dreams can become reality.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8414582.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420688, 37.779613], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: MUSIC", "OtherInfo": "SF Performances: Pianists Natasha Paremski and Alfredo Rodriguez Pianists Natasha Paremski and Alfredo Rodriguez present a unique piano program that demonstrates the best of classical and jazz piano styles.", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Herbst Theatre"}, {"Address": "Penngrove, CA", "Artist": "Sarah McQuaid", "ArtistBio": "Sarah McQuaid is a singer, guitarist and songwriter, based in the UK and touring internationally.

En 1975 decidieron juntarse para tocar distintos temas de grupos a los que admiraban, entre ellos The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, The Police, entre otros. Inicialmente, se hac\u00edan llamar The Spies of the Green Hat, pero pronto el nombre se abrevi\u00f3 a Green Hat y, finalmente, se adapt\u00f3 al espa\u00f1ol como Sombrero Verde, ya que la banda deseaba tocar rock en su propio idioma, siendo de los primeros grupos en aventurarse a componer sus propias canciones aun cuando el rock en espa\u00f1ol no era una tendencia. En 1981 publicaron su primer disco, Sombrero Verde, con el sello Ariola; los sencillos fueron \"Vampiro\", \"Profesor\", \"Long time\" y \"Despi\u00e9rtate\". En 1983 lanzaron A Tiempo de Rock; los sencillos del \u00e1lbum ser\u00edan \"Laura\", \"Hechos nada m\u00e1s\" y \"Me voy al mar\". Con esta producci\u00f3n el grupo logr\u00f3 escaso \u00e9xito. En 1984, Abraham Calleros, baterista del grupo, decide dejar la banda para continuar su carrera musical en Estados Unidos. El grupo decide poner un anuncio en el peri\u00f3dico solicitando un nuevo integrante, gracias a esto encuentran al joven baterista de origen cubano-colombiano nacido en Miami, Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, quien a partir de ese momento ser\u00eda pieza clave de la historia del grupo. La vida de Sombrero Verde continu\u00f3 hasta 1986, cuando el guitarrista Gustavo Orozco decide tambi\u00e9n abandonar la agrupaci\u00f3n concentrarse en sus estudios acad\u00e9micos. Al quedar de nuevo el grupo como cuarteto, Fher decide cerrar el libro de Sombrero Verde y formar una nueva banda que fusionara el rock, pop y los ritmos latinos. En esa \u00e9poca, comenz\u00f3 en M\u00e9xico el movimiento denominado \"Rock en tu idioma\", una estrategia comercial de algunas compa\u00f1\u00edas discogr\u00e1ficas encaminada a llamar la atenci\u00f3n de los j\u00f3venes para desarrollar m\u00fasica rock en espa\u00f1ol. La tendencia, importada de Argentina y Espa\u00f1a, estaba avalada por el trabajo pionero de grupos como Soda Stereo, Enanitos Verdes, Mecano, Nacha Pop, La Uni\u00f3n, Radio Futura, Hombres G y Zas (La banda de Miguel Mateos); como consecuencia de ello, aparecieron varias bandas mexicanas formadas por j\u00f3venes con influencias musicales de grupos norteamericanos y europeos. Surgieron as\u00ed las bandas l\u00edderes del movimiento en M\u00e9xico: Caifanes, Maldita Vecindad, Caf\u00e9 Tacvba y, entre ellas, Man\u00e1, quienes lograr\u00edan \u00e9xito no solo a nivel local sino tambi\u00e9n internacionalmente. Man\u00e1 En medio de este naciente movimiento, la banda adopt\u00f3 el nombre que le dar\u00eda proyecci\u00f3n internacional: \u00abMan\u00e1\u00bb, que fue elegido por el significado que tiene la palabra en polinesio: \u00abenerg\u00eda positiva\u00bb. La alineaci\u00f3n qued\u00f3 conformada por Fher Olvera como vocalista, los hermanos Ulises y Ju\u00e1n Diego Calleros, en guitarra y bajo respectivamente, y Alex Gonz\u00e1lez en la bater\u00eda. En 1987, el grupo firm\u00f3 con la discogr\u00e1fica Polygram y public\u00f3 Man\u00e1, disco que afianzar\u00eda el movimiento Rock en tu idioma. De este trabajo se desprendieron los sencillos: \u201cRobot\u201d, \u201cMentirosa\u201d, \u201cMueve tus caderas\u201d y \u201cQueremos paz\u201d. Con esta producci\u00f3n el grupo tuvo escaso \u00e9xito, y no dej\u00f3 del todo satisfechos a los integrantes; diversos roces con la disquera por el deseo de mantener la esencia e identidad del grupo, llevaron a Man\u00e1 a pedir su carta de retiro de Polygram. Falta Amor Con un futuro incierto el grupo trabaja en nuevos demos y busca una nueva compa\u00f1\u00eda discogr\u00e1fica, logrando firmar con Warner Music M\u00e9xico. Tras la mala experiencia del primer disco, Fher y Alex estaban concientes de los riesgos que implica ponerse en las manos de un productor que no entend\u00eda el concepto del grupo ni su propuesta art\u00edstica, por lo que optaron por iniciarse en un camino del cual no se han apartado desde entonces: asumir ellos la producci\u00f3n de todos sus discos. Con esa idea en mente graban el \u00e1lbum Falta Amor (1989), que no obtiene \u00e9xito sino hasta un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s de su lanzamiento gracias al sencillo \u201cRayando el sol\u201d, el cual se convierte en el primer gran \u00e9xito para Man\u00e1; los sencillos \u201cPerdido en un barco\u201d, \u201cEstoy agotado\u201d y \u201cBusc\u00e1ndola\u201d llegan tambi\u00e9n al gusto de la gente. El grupo realiza 112 presentaciones en M\u00e9xico y su primer concierto multitudinario fuera de las fronteras de su pa\u00eds, en el Coliseo General Rumi\u00f1ahui de Quito, Ecuador. Fue gracias a esta presentaci\u00f3n que el grupo se dio cuenta del potencial que la banda pod\u00eda tener a nivel internacional. \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os? En 1991 Man\u00e1 enfrenta el primer cambio en su alineaci\u00f3n con la salida de Ulises Calleros, quien desde entonces se dedica a representar al grupo. Ello signific\u00f3 la llegada de dos nuevos miembros: el tecladista Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez y el guitarrista C\u00e9sar \u201cEl Vampiro\u201d L\u00f3pez. Con esa nueva formaci\u00f3n graban en Los \u00c1ngeles en el a\u00f1o 1992 \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os?, \u00e1lbum que constituye un aut\u00e9ntico parteaguas en la historia del grupo y en la del rock en espa\u00f1ol, manteni\u00e9ndose durante 97 semanas en la lista Billboard de los discos m\u00e1s vendidos de Latinoam\u00e9rica. Ocho sencillos de esta producci\u00f3n encabezaron las listas de popularidad en toda la Am\u00e9rica hispanoparlante y se han convertido en temas cl\u00e1sicos de su repertorio: \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d, \u201c\u00bfD\u00f3nde jugar\u00e1n los ni\u00f1os?\u201d, \u201cDe pies a cabeza\u201d, \u201cComo te deseo\u201d, \u201cOye mi amor\u201d, \u201cC\u00f3mo diablos\u201d, \u201cTe llor\u00e9 un r\u00edo\u201d y \u201cMe vale\u201d. La globalizaci\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 inicia en 1993, con una maquinaria promocional de primer nivel y una serie de 268 conciertos en m\u00e1s de 17 pa\u00edses. La gira fue un \u00e9xito y posicion\u00f3 a la banda entre la comunidad latina de Estados Unidos y en mercados como Chile, Ecuador, Per\u00fa, Bolivia, Venezuela y Argentina. Argentina y Espa\u00f1a, dos territorios hist\u00f3ricamente dif\u00edciles de alcanzar para artistas latinos no nativos, fueron tambi\u00e9n conquistados por el fen\u00f3meno de Man\u00e1 gracias a que el tema \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d alcanz\u00f3 el primer lugar en las listas de popularidad de ambos pa\u00edses, lo cual no hab\u00eda sucedido en 26 a\u00f1os. Este mismo tema se hace merecedor al premio MTV Latino Video Music Award como mejor video del a\u00f1o. En Abril de 1994 y por diferencias art\u00edsticas y profesionales, Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez y C\u00e9sar \u201cEl Vampiro\u201d L\u00f3pez dejan Man\u00e1 a la mitad de la gira. Por un segundo, el futuro de la banda y su tour estuvo en duda, pero pronto demostraron que la formula de la agrupaci\u00f3n y su esencia segu\u00eda intacta. Para acabar la gira contrataron a los m\u00fasicos Ju\u00e1n Carlos Toribio como apoyo en teclados, Gustavo Orozco en guitarra y Sheila R\u00edos en coros. Man\u00e1 en Vivo Con su nuevo y bien merecido estatus en la escena del rock pop latino internacional, el tr\u00edo compuesto por Fher, Alex y Ju\u00e1n lanzaron el disco Man\u00e1 en Vivo (1994). La idea de lanzar un disco de sus conciertos surge como un medio para capturar la energ\u00eda y revivir cada momento, cada gota de adrenalina y sudor que forman parte de la magia de las presentaciones de Mana. El disco fue grabado entre Agosto y Septiembre de 1994, durante las presentaciones del grupo en el Universal Amphitheatre de Los \u00c1ngeles, la Sports Arena en San Diego, el Aragon Theatre en Chicago, el Teatro Gran Rex en Buenos Aires, el Estadio de Chile en Santiago y la Sala Est\u00e1ndar en Barcelona. Una vez m\u00e1s, la revista Billboard los galardon\u00f3 con el premio al mejor \u00c1lbum Rock/Pop del A\u00f1o. Cuando Los \u00c1ngeles Lloran Deseosos de regresar a su formaci\u00f3n original como cuarteto, Man\u00e1 tiene el tercer y \u00faltimo cambio en su alineaci\u00f3n. La banda audiciona a m\u00e1s de 80 guitarristas de M\u00e9xico, Argentina, Chile y Estados Unidos, hasta que finalmente en Aguascalientes, M\u00e9xico, encuentran al talento que buscaban en Sergio Vall\u00edn, cuya sorprendente sensibilidad, t\u00e9cnica y versatilidad vienen a darle un lustre distinto al sonido de las guitarras en las producciones de la banda. Con esa nueva formaci\u00f3n y con demos hechos en Guadalajara y Puerto Vallarta, graban y editan el disco Cuando los \u00c1ngeles Lloran (1995) entre Los \u00c1ngeles y el puerto jalisciense. Esta producci\u00f3n, lanzada tres a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su exitoso \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os? se distingue por una notable evoluci\u00f3n en la l\u00edrica y el sonido del grupo. Los sencillos \u201cD\u00e9jame entrar\u201d, \u201cNo ha parado de llover\u201d y \u201cHundido en un rinc\u00f3n\u201d no solo representaron un rotundo \u00e9xito en la radio, sino que los videos correspondientes tuvieron una gran rotaci\u00f3n en los canales de m\u00fasica y ganaron diversos premios por su calidad. El disco les permiti\u00f3 una primera nominaci\u00f3n al premio Grammy Americano, el m\u00e1s importante en la industria discogr\u00e1fica. Con el estandarte de un nuevo disco el grupo inicia su nueva gira el 12 de mayo de 1995, con un total de 52 conciertos realizados en 13 pa\u00edses, esto en un per\u00edodo de menos de cinco meses, lo cual mostr\u00f3 el fen\u00f3meno que para ese momento ya significaba Man\u00e1. Durante su visita a Espa\u00f1a en ese mismo a\u00f1o, el grupo se present\u00f3 en la plaza de Las Ventas junto a Revolver y La Uni\u00f3n, donde el p\u00fablico recibi\u00f3 a la banda con los brazos abiertos. La gira Cu\u00e1ndo Los \u00c1ngeles Lloran signific\u00f3 al grupo presentaciones con sold out completos en cada plaza que visitaban. Otros impresionantes logros fueron la inclusi\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 en el festival de Jazz de Montreaux y la conferencia Midem, que tuvieron lugar en Suiza y Francia, respectivamente, una proeza nunca antes alcanzada. Tambi\u00e9n participan con un tema en la pel\u00edcula My Family, a petici\u00f3n del prestigiado director Francis Ford Coppola. Man\u00e1 siempre ha expresado su inter\u00e9s en los problemas que el planeta est\u00e1 enfrentando en materia de ecolog\u00eda, por lo que en Septiembre de 1995 crearon la Fundaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica Selva Negra, con el objetivo de crear conciencia sobre el tema. (www.selvanegra.org.mx) A mediados de Abril de 1996, el grupo continu\u00f3 una extensa y esperada gira por toda la Rep\u00fablica Mexicana. Durante la segunda mitad de 1996 la banda se aventur\u00f3 en una gira de 17 conciertos con localidades agotadas en Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, Santa Barbara, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, New Orle\u00e1ns, Sacramento, Miami, San Jose, Phoenix, San Bernardino, Tucson, Anaheim y las Vegas. Dicho tour les vali\u00f3 importantes art\u00edculos en prestigiosas revistas como Rolling Stone, Time, Details, People Magazine, Newsweek y Pollstar. El 7 de Septiembre de 1996 la banda se presenta dos noches con localidades agotadas en el James Knight Center de Miami, logro nunca antes alcanzado por una banda de rock pop latina. La producci\u00f3n le vali\u00f3 al grupo el premio Billboard al Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock/Pop Latino, lo cual fijo un record de 6 premios Billboard recibidos en un per\u00edodo de 3 a\u00f1os. Despu\u00e9s de sus presentaciones en Estados Unidos la banda regresa a M\u00e9xico, donde dan 2 exitosos conciertos en la Plaza de Toros de su natal Guadalajara. Durante su estad\u00eda en dicha ciudad, la banda dio una conferencia de prensa para anunciar el lanzamiento de su website; mientras la conferencia ten\u00eda lugar el sitio recibi\u00f3 6000 entradas, una cifra sorprendente tomando en cuenta la \u00e9poca. En Marzo de 1997 la reconocida revista americana especializada en bateristas y la industria de este instrumento, Modern Drummer, public\u00f3 un art\u00edculo sobre Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, en la cual se\u00f1ala a Man\u00e1 como todo un suceso dentro del rock pop latino en Estados Unidos, a la par de reconocer a Alex como uno de los mejores bateristas a nivel mundial dentro del g\u00e9nero. 11 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, en Marzo de 2008 Alex aparece de nuevo en la revista, pero esta vez en una extensa entrevista. Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos Tras una favorable experiencia de su anterior grabaci\u00f3n en Puerto Vallarta, sitio important\u00edsimo en el atlas creativo de Man\u00e1, el grupo decide regresar para hacer los demos y la grabaci\u00f3n de su pr\u00f3xima producci\u00f3n. As\u00ed, con la ambici\u00f3n de crear m\u00fasica en un ambiente donde el agua, elemento vital como pocos, tuviera una presencia contundente, Man\u00e1 renta una hermosa casa con vista a Bah\u00eda de Banderas, en Conchas Chinas, y graban el disco Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos en 1997. Incontables atardeceres frente al oc\u00e9ano fueron el marco id\u00f3neo para concebir Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, \u00e1lbum producido tambi\u00e9n por Fher y Alex, en colaboraci\u00f3n con Benny Faccone. El resultado fue una energ\u00e9tica mezcla de rock, pop y ritmos latinos que van desde el bosanova hasta el flamenco, pasando por la cadencia caribe\u00f1a del reggae. Importantes sencillos como \u201cEn el Muelle de San Bl\u00e1s\u201d, \u201cHechicera\u201d, \u201cClavado en un bar\u201d y \u201cComo dueles en los labios\u201d se desprenden de esta producci\u00f3n. El disco sali\u00f3 al mercado en Octubre de 1997 y fue lanzado simult\u00e1neamente en 36 pa\u00edses; debut\u00f3 en primer lugar en el Billboard Hot Latin 50 Chart. La producci\u00f3n son\u00f3 fuerte tambi\u00e9n en la Uni\u00f3n Americana y Man\u00e1 se convirti\u00f3 en la primera banda de rock en espa\u00f1ol que se present\u00f3 en El Show de Kathie Lee & Regis, emisi\u00f3n l\u00edder de audiencia en la televisi\u00f3n estadounidense. El 30 de Enero de 1998 la banda inici\u00f3 su gira m\u00e1s ambiciosa, Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos World Tour en Chile, para posteriormente visitar Uruguay y M\u00e9xico. Tras una pausa de 4 semanas debido a que el baterista, Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, fue diagnosticado con hepatitis A, el grupo reanud\u00f3 la gira por su natal M\u00e9xico, donde ofrecieron 44 conciertos. Entre las presentaciones que destacan en la gira Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos Tour 98 se encuentran las de Bolivia, Colombia, Per\u00fa, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Chile, Puerto Rico, Honduras, y El Salvador. Otras de las presentaciones m\u00e1s importantes son los conciertos en el Auditorio Nacional, recinto en el que Man\u00e1 rompi\u00f3 r\u00e9cord, pues fue la primera ocasi\u00f3n en que una banda de este g\u00e9nero se presenta siete veces consecutivas sobre este escenario. De vital importancia para la carrera de Man\u00e1 fue ser la primera banda de rock en espa\u00f1ol firmada por la agencia Creative Artist Agency (CAA), con ello Man\u00e1 se un\u00eda a la importante lista de representados que inclu\u00eda a Bon Jovi, AC/DC, Alanis Morissette, Eric Clapton, Madonna, Depeche Mode, Santana, Bob Dylan, George Michael, entre otros. Su primer gira de la mano con CAA inici\u00f3 el 21 de agosto de 1998 en Los \u00c1ngeles, CA y cubri\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 30 ciudades con un total de 36 shows en arenas y anfiteatros, la mayor\u00eda de ellas con llenos totales. Importantes presentaciones tuvieron lugar en el Universal Amphitheatre de Los \u00c1ngeles y en el Rosemont Horizon Arena, donde rompen record al ser el primer grupo de rock pop latino en agotar localidades. Este tour fue el m\u00e1s grande realizado por un grupo de rock pop latino en Estados Unidos. La banda es nominada por sexta vez consecutiva a los premios que otorga la revista Billboard por Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, dentro del rubro Mejor \u00c1lbum Pop Rock del A\u00f1o, llev\u00e1ndose el cotizado premio. En diciembre de 1998, Man\u00e1 fue nominado por segunda vez a los Premios Grammy Americanos en la categor\u00eda Mejor \u00c1lbum Latino de Rock/Alternativo por Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, premio al que se hicieron merecedores el 24 de febrero de 1999. Este es el primer Grammy otorgado a una banda de rock pop mexicana. Tambi\u00e9n en diciembre de 1998, Fher recibe una invitaci\u00f3n por parte de Carlos Santana para participar en su nuevo material discogr\u00e1fico. Fher compone \u00a8Coraz\u00f3n espinado\u00a8, tema con el cual se abren fronteras para la m\u00fasica latina, tras colocarse este sencillo en los primeros lugares de pa\u00edses europeos, asi\u00e1ticos, y americanos. La grabaci\u00f3n se realiz\u00f3 en las ciudades de Los \u00c1ngeles y San Francisco CA, en donde naci\u00f3 una gran amistad entre ambos m\u00fasicos. Como resultado de esta colaboraci\u00f3n, Alex y Fher reciben el premio Grammy como productores y escritores de dicha canci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de realizar junto a Santana una gira por Estados Unidos y M\u00e9xico. El grupo comparti\u00f3 arenas, auditorios y estadios de la Uni\u00f3n Americana con Carlos Santana, en una extensa gira que dar\u00eda comienzo el 29 de julio de 1999 en la ciudad de Houston TX, seguida de varias presentaciones por diferentes ciudades de ese estado, para continuar en Phoenix, Tucson, San Diego, Anaheim, Mountain View, Concord, Sacramento, Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Boise, y Denver. Abrir\u00eda los conciertos el grupo Ozomatli, seguidos de Man\u00e1 y Carlos Santana alternando el orden de estos en cada una de sus presentaciones. Conciertos hist\u00f3ricos se llevan a cabo en el Arrowhead Pond en Anaheim, donde el grupo realiza cuatro shows sold out. La combinaci\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 y Carlos Santana dej\u00f3 sin duda huella en el mercado de rock en espa\u00f1ol, como uno de los acontecimientos m\u00e1s grandes de la historia del g\u00e9nero en los Estados Unidos. En total Man\u00e1 y Santana hab\u00edan realizado 43 shows por Estados Unidos, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, Guadalajara, y Monterrey al finalizar la gira en diciembre de 1999. MTV Unplugged La cadena de videos MTV llevaba varios a\u00f1os solicitando a Man\u00e1 su participaci\u00f3n en la serie de grabaciones Unplugged, sin que la banda hubiese podido acceder a la petici\u00f3n debido a los compromisos que le significaban sus grabaciones y extensas giras. Finalmente se dieron las condiciones para el proyecto, por lo que el 9 de Marzo de 1999 la banda graba Man\u00e1 Unplugged en Miami ante un \u00edntimo publico de 70 afortunados fans. En dicho material el grupo incluye \u00e9xitos de su repertorio m\u00e1s 3 covers en modalidad ac\u00fastica; tambi\u00e9n contiene el interludio musical \u00a8Coladito\u00a8, duelo de percusi\u00f3n entre Alex G\u00f3nzalez y el m\u00fasico invitado Lu\u00eds Conte, donde se pude apreciar la destreza de ambos ejecutantes. El 22 de Junio de 1999 el material se lanza a la venta simult\u00e1neamente en todo el continente americano, alcanzando el primer lugar de ventas en el TOP 50 Latino de la revista Billboard, con lo cual la banda repite la haza\u00f1a de ser el \u00fanico grupo de rock latino en lograrlo. Hasta el momento, este disco sigue siendo uno de los m\u00e1s vendidos para la cadena de televisi\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de que fue el primer artista latino en lanzar un material de este tipo (CD/DVD). El primer sencillo que se desprendi\u00f3 de esta producci\u00f3n, tema original de Juan Gabriel, \u201cSe me olvid\u00f3 otra vez\u201d permaneci\u00f3 durante m\u00e1s de 5 semanas consecutivas en el primer lugar en las listas de radio de gran parte de M\u00e9xico y Latinoam\u00e9rica. \u201cTe solt\u00e9 la rienda\u201d, del compositor Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez fue otro exitos\u00edsimo sencillo que se desprendi\u00f3 de esta grabaci\u00f3n. A principios de enero del 2000, Man\u00e1 recibe la noticia de su nominaci\u00f3n a los premios Grammy en la categor\u00eda de Mejor \u00c1lbum de Pop Latino por su disco MTV Unplugged, esta era la tercera vez consecutiva que el grupo estaba nominado a tan afamados premios. La banda con muchas ganas de tocar arranca una gira por Sudam\u00e9rica y el Caribe el 17 de Marzo de 2000, visitando pa\u00edses como Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Uruguay, Puerto Rico y Republica Dominicana; las presentaciones en la capital Argentina lograron un \u00e9xito y expectaci\u00f3n impresionante, tras ofrecer un concierto en el Estadio Ferro de Buenos Aires a tan solo unas semanas de haber realizado 2 conciertos previos en el Luna Park de esa misma ciudad; lo mismo sucedi\u00f3 en el estadio Santa Laura, en Santiago de Chile. El resto de la gira luci\u00f3 con llenos totales en todos los lugares en donde Man\u00e1 se present\u00f3. A mediados del mes de abril en la ciudad de Miami, se celebraron los premios Billboard a la M\u00fasica Latina, en los cuales Man\u00e1 recibe 2 premios importantes, el primero al Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Pop Latino por su producci\u00f3n MTV Unplugged, y el segundo premio para la Fundaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica Selva Negra, denominado Spirit of Hope el cual se entrega \u00fanicamente a aquellos artistas que se han destacado por realizar acciones altruistas en pro del medio ambiente y de los derechos humanos. En estas mismas fechas el grupo recibe un reconocimiento que por primera vez se les otorga, el premio que concede la cadena de renta y venta de videos y m\u00fasica m\u00e1s grande de los Estados Unidos, el Block Buster Award por Mejor Artista Latino. En el mes de Junio Man\u00e1 comienza su Gira por Espa\u00f1a y las Canarias en un tour denominado Tourriata, visitando ciudades como: Tenerife, Pamplona, Zaragoza, Toledo, Santiago, Burgos, Palencia, Zamora, Barcelona, Madrid, Victoria, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Gijon, La Coru\u00f1a, Elche, San Javier Murcia, Valencia, Sevilla, San Fernando y M\u00e1laga. Cabe mencionar que en la capital espa\u00f1ola, las dos fechas en la plaza de toros Las Ventas fueron llenos totales, lo cual era una haza\u00f1a dif\u00edcil a\u00fan para los artistas de origen espa\u00f1ol, y un logro nunca antes alcanzado por una banda o artista latino. En el resto de la gira que realizaron a lo largo y ancho de la Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica lograron igualmente ventas totales. En el mes de septiembre el grupo asiste a la primera entrega del Grammy Latino, en donde junto con Carlos Santana interpretaron el tema \u201cCoraz\u00f3n espinado\u201d, siendo \u00e9ste unos de los momentos m\u00e1s memorables de la noche. En dicha ceremonia Man\u00e1 resulto ganador de 3 Grammy por su participaci\u00f3n en el \u00e1lbum del guitarrista. Durante su estancia en la ciudad de Los \u00c1ngeles, Man\u00e1 es invitado a interpretar el tema \u201cCoraz\u00f3n espinado\u201d al lado de Carlos Santana en el #1 talk show de los Estados Unidos \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d con Jay Leno, quien reconoci\u00f3 a Man\u00e1 como el grupo de rock pop latino m\u00e1s importante. La banda no para y lanza el compilatorio titulado Grandes Man\u00e1, cuya edici\u00f3n se hizo solamente para Europa y Escandinavia; a escasas semanas de haber salido a la venta ocup\u00f3 las primeras posiciones de la radio principalmente de la Pen\u00ednsula It\u00e1lica con el tema \u201cEn el Muelle de San Blas\u201d. Con este suceso Man\u00e1 visita en Noviembre del 2001 por primera vez Italia, en una gira promocional en la cual realizan un showcase en Mil\u00e1n para medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, personalidades y p\u00fablico en general. Italia adopt\u00f3 a Man\u00e1, la barrera del idioma se rompe y entran directo a los primeros lugares de la radio, apareciendo en las primeras planas de la prensa nacional Italiana. Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor A principios de 2002 la banda se encierra para componer y hacer demos de lo que ser\u00eda su pr\u00f3ximo disco de estudio a tres a\u00f1os del lanzamiento de Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos. Lanzan Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor en Junio de 2002, disco en \u00e9l que se muestra la b\u00fasqueda de la banda por mezclar su esencia con el sonido de rock de los sesentas y setentas, adem\u00e1s de otras fusiones de m\u00fasica latina. El resultado fue una colecci\u00f3n de grabaciones completamente energ\u00e9ticas, con un sonido que privilegia el de las guitarras pero que no renuncia a la b\u00fasqueda y la fusi\u00f3n. Este, su sexto \u00e1lbum de estudio, fue grabado en su totalidad en Los \u00c1ngeles, entre Febrero y Mayo de 2002 y cont\u00f3 con la participaci\u00f3n de Carlos Santana y su guitarra en el tema \u201cJusticia, Tierra y Libertad\u201d, as\u00ed como la de Rub\u00e9n Blades en \u201cS\u00e1banas fr\u00edas\u201d. Cabe destacar que el guitarrista del grupo, Sergio Vall\u00edn, particip\u00f3 cantando el tema \u201c\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 te vas?\u201d, dedicado a sus padres. Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor alcanz\u00f3 el primer lugar en ventas en Espa\u00f1a, Latinoam\u00e9rica y Estados Unidos durante cinco semanas consecutivas. Tuvo como sencillos m\u00e1s destacados \u201c\u00c1ngel de amor\u201d, \u201cEres mi religi\u00f3n\u201d y \u201cMariposa traicionera\u201d. Gracias al \u00e9xito obtenido en Italia, el cantante Zucchero los invita a participar en la canci\u00f3n \u201cBaila morena\u201d, dueto que resulta todo un \u00e9xito tanto en Am\u00e9rica como en Europa. Man\u00e1 le devuelve el gesto al cantante al invitarlo a participar en la canci\u00f3n \u201cEres mi religi\u00f3n\u201d pero ahora en italiano, que luego fue incluida en una edici\u00f3n especial del disco Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor editado en Europa. El 29 de Septiembre de 2002 Man\u00e1 se aventura a una nueva gira de dos a\u00f1os que los pondr\u00eda como nunca antes al mercado internacional. La gira llev\u00f3 al grupo no solo a ciudades de Estados Unidos, M\u00e9xico, Latinoam\u00e9rica y Espa\u00f1a, sino a nuevas plazas como Roma, Mil\u00e1n, Par\u00eds, Berl\u00edn, Eifel, Nuremberg, Munich, Stuggart, Hamburgo, R\u00edo de Janeiro y Sao Paolo. La primera incursi\u00f3n de la banda en el dif\u00edcil mercado brasile\u00f1o se dio con llenos totales; lo mismo sucedi\u00f3 en sus presentaciones en Italia, Francia y Alemania donde alcanzaron un lugar entre los 30 mejores \u00e1lbumes respecto a ventas. En total, el grupo realiz\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 100 conciertos en 24 pa\u00edses. Durante su estancia por Europa, la banda particip\u00f3 en el especial Pavarotti & Friends al lado de Zucchero, donde se presentaron con estrellas de la talla de Bono, Eric Clapton, Lionel Ritchie, Queen, Deep Purple, Ricky Martin y Andrea Bocceli. Man\u00e1 recibe dos nominaciones en la 4ta entrega de los Grammy Latino que se realizaron en Miami el 3 de Septiembre de 2003, en las categor\u00edas de Mejor Ingenier\u00eda de Grabaci\u00f3n para un \u00c1lbum y Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock por un D\u00fao o Grupo, llev\u00e1ndose esta \u00faltima presea. Esenciales Man\u00e1 El 18 de Noviembre de 2003 el grupo, cansado de tantos a\u00f1os de trabajo, decide tomar un a\u00f1o sab\u00e1tico y aprovechan para lanzar los recopilatorios Esenciales en tres versiones: Sol, Luna y Eclipse, que incluyen sus temas m\u00e1s exitosos y otras colaboraciones de la banda, como por ejemplo la versi\u00f3n de \u201cFool in the rain\u201d, canci\u00f3n original de Led Zeppelin incluida en el tributo Encomium al legendario grupo ingl\u00e9s y donde Man\u00e1 fue el \u00fanico artista latino invitado. Tambi\u00e9n se encuentra en la compilaci\u00f3n la canci\u00f3n in\u00e9dita \u201cTe llevar\u00e9 al cielo\u201d, tema que se convirti\u00f3 en todo un \u00e9xito, alcanzando r\u00e1pidamente los primeros lugares de popularidad en radio y video. A manera de agradecimiento a sus seguidores, deciden poner a la venta el 12 de Diciembre de 2004 el DVD llamado Acceso Total, el cual incluye im\u00e1genes del tour Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor (2002-2003) m\u00e1s escenas nunca antes vistas en camerinos, permiti\u00e9ndole a los fans tener \u2018acceso total\u2019 a la experiencia que vive Man\u00e1 en sus giras. Amar es Combatir Casi 5 a\u00f1os hab\u00edan pasado desde el \u00faltimo disco de estudio de la banda, Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor, por lo que ya corr\u00edan rumores y especulaciones sobre la separaci\u00f3n del grupo. Lo que nadie sab\u00eda era que tras su a\u00f1o sab\u00e1tico y desde principios de 2005, Man\u00e1 se reuni\u00f3 para empezar a componer su s\u00e9ptimo disco de estudio, Amar es Combatir. En Febrero de 2006 la banda decide viajar a Miami, ciudad siempre vibrante, abrazada por el ambiente tropical y con una esencia latina que se respira en el aire, comuni\u00f3n id\u00f3nea para inspirar la grabaci\u00f3n de este CD en el que la banda llev\u00f3 a cabo una fusi\u00f3n de rock, pop, m\u00fasica latina, reggae, hasta drum and bass. Producido por Fher y Alex, al igual que sus discos anteriores, Amar es Combatir fue lanzado el 22 de agosto de 2006 y es editado en 40 pa\u00edses alrededor del mundo, alcanzando el n\u00famero 4 en el Top 200 \u00c1lbumes de la revista Billboard en los Estados Unidos, r\u00e9cord solamente alcanzado para una producci\u00f3n enteramente en espa\u00f1ol por el \u00e1lbum Fijaci\u00f3n Oral Vol. 1 de Shakira. Su primer sencillo, \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d, permanece durante ocho semanas consecutivas en el primer lugar de los charts latinos de radio y es nombrado entre los medios latinos m\u00e1s reconocidos de la uni\u00f3n Americana como uno de los tracks m\u00e1s escuchados y premiados del 2006. Los sencillos que le siguieron, \u201cBendita tu luz\u201d (a d\u00fao con Ju\u00e1n Luis Guerra) y \u201cManda una se\u00f1al\u201d se posicionan tambi\u00e9n en el primer lugar de las listas de popularidad. A estos se agregar\u00eda un quinto sencillo, \u201cEl rey tibur\u00f3n\u201d, lo cual es un logro a destacar ya que es cada vez menos frecuente que de una producci\u00f3n se desprendan 5 sencillos, dada la complicada situaci\u00f3n por la que atraviesa la industria. En noviembre de 2006 el grupo participa en la 7ma edici\u00f3n del Grammy Latino, donde adem\u00e1s de actuar junto a Ju\u00e1n Luis Guerra con un excelente performance de sus \u00e9xitos, que les vali\u00f3 una sentida ovaci\u00f3n de parte de los asistentes al evento y que fue uno de los momentos cl\u00edmax de la velada, reciben un homenaje por su trayectoria art\u00edstica y logros en la m\u00fasica. En febrero de 2007 y tras recibir 5 nominaciones a los premios Billboard Latino, 4 nominaciones a los premios Lo Nuestro y una al Grammy Americano como Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Alternativo o Urbano, Man\u00e1 inicia su gira Amar Es Combatir World Tour, con la mayor producci\u00f3n que haya tenido el grupo hasta el momento (m\u00e1s de 60 toneladas de equipo), la cual los llevar\u00eda a dar 116 conciertos durante un per\u00edodo de un a\u00f1o y medio. Los conciertos de Man\u00e1 en Estados Unidos y Puerto Rico, incluyeron shows en ciudades como San Diego, Los \u00c1ngeles, Laredo, Houston, Corpus Christi, Miami, Orlando, Nueva York, Washington, Chicago, Atlanta y San Ju\u00e1n de Puerto Rico. Man\u00e1 se convierte en la primera banda de rock pop en espa\u00f1ol en llenar por tres noches (dos consecutivas) el Madison Square Garden de Nueva York. Destacan tambi\u00e9n sus cuatro conciertos sold out consecutivos en el Staple Center de Los \u00c1ngeles, tres noches sold out en el Miami American Airlines Arena, tres m\u00e1s en el Toyota Center de Houston y cuatro sold out en el Coliseo Jos\u00e9 M. Agrelot de Puerto Rico. Adem\u00e1s de reunirse en Washington D.C. con la senadora estadounidense Hillary Clinton para compartir opiniones sobre el medio ambiente y migraci\u00f3n, Man\u00e1 recibe un reconocimiento por las m\u00e1s de 450,000 descargas de su ringtone \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d. Su gira por Latinoam\u00e9rica incluy\u00f3 conciertos en Chile, Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Panam\u00e1, Venezuela, Colombia, Per\u00fa, Brasil y Rep\u00fablica Dominicana. El grupo toc\u00f3 en grandes foros, de los cuales destacan los conciertos del grupo en Argentina: tres presentaciones en el Estadio Velez de Buenos Aires as\u00ed como en el Estadio Chateau Carrera de C\u00f3rdoba, el Estadio Central en Rosario y el Estadio Malvinas en Mendoza. Otras presentaciones de gran relevancia fueron: Estadio Defensores del Chaco en Asunci\u00f3n, Estadio del Ej\u00e9rcito en Guatemala, Estadio M\u00e1gico en San Salvador, Estadio de Futbol de Managhua, Estadio Ol\u00edmpico de Caracas, el Parque Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar en Bogot\u00e1, Estadio Alberto Spencer en Guayaquil, Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Atahualpa en Quito, Estadio Alejandro Serrano en Cuenca, Credicard Hall en Sao Paulo, Citibank Hall en Rio de Janeiro, Estadio Gigantinho en Porto Alegre y el Estadio Quisquella en Santo Domingo. Durante Junio y Julio de 2007 llevan su gira a Espa\u00f1a, donde rompen records al posicionarse como el artista latino de mayor convocatoria en la madre patria, al vender todas las localidades para sus conciertos en 15 provincias: Zaragoza, Pamplona, Bilbao, Gij\u00f3n, Santiago, Le\u00f3n, Barcelona, Madrid, Murcia, Alicante, Albacete, M\u00e1laga, Sevilla, Las Palmas y Tenerife. Cabe destacar la nominaci\u00f3n del grupo en los premios World Music Awards, realizados en M\u00f3naco, Francia. Este premio se entrega de acuerdo a las ventas que un artista logr\u00f3 durante un a\u00f1o y donde Man\u00e1 comparti\u00f3 escenario al lado de artistas como Celine Dion, Avril Lavigne, Rihanna, Patty Labelle, entre otros. Entre los premios m\u00e1s destacados que la banda obtuvo por esta producci\u00f3n se encuentra un Grammy Americano en el rubro de Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Alternativo o Urbano, 3 galardones Lo Nuestro por \u00c1lbum de Rock del A\u00f1o, Artista Rock del A\u00f1o y canci\u00f3n Rock del A\u00f1o; 2 Billboard Latinos por \u00c1lbum Rock Alternativo del A\u00f1o y tema Pop Airplay del A\u00f1o de D\u00fao o Grupo. Arde El Cielo La impresionante respuesta que tuvo la gira Amar Es Combatir World Tour fue una experiencia sorprendente para la banda, por lo que decidieron capturar esa energ\u00eda, esa adrenalina, en una grabaci\u00f3n con la cual sus seguidores pudieran recordar y revivir esos momentos.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings.

The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. He\u2019s never more than one degree away from a powerful musical hook-up.", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.409274, 37.785697], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "Frances Ruffelle, the Tony Award-winning star of Broadway and London's West End, brings her acclaimed show, Frances Ruffelle Live(S) in New York\u2026in San Francisco!, to Feinstein\u2019s at the Nikko for two performances only.

En 1975 decidieron juntarse para tocar distintos temas de grupos a los que admiraban, entre ellos The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, The Police, entre otros. Inicialmente, se hac\u00edan llamar The Spies of the Green Hat, pero pronto el nombre se abrevi\u00f3 a Green Hat y, finalmente, se adapt\u00f3 al espa\u00f1ol como Sombrero Verde, ya que la banda deseaba tocar rock en su propio idioma, siendo de los primeros grupos en aventurarse a componer sus propias canciones aun cuando el rock en espa\u00f1ol no era una tendencia. En 1981 publicaron su primer disco, Sombrero Verde, con el sello Ariola; los sencillos fueron \"Vampiro\", \"Profesor\", \"Long time\" y \"Despi\u00e9rtate\". En 1983 lanzaron A Tiempo de Rock; los sencillos del \u00e1lbum ser\u00edan \"Laura\", \"Hechos nada m\u00e1s\" y \"Me voy al mar\". Con esta producci\u00f3n el grupo logr\u00f3 escaso \u00e9xito. En 1984, Abraham Calleros, baterista del grupo, decide dejar la banda para continuar su carrera musical en Estados Unidos. El grupo decide poner un anuncio en el peri\u00f3dico solicitando un nuevo integrante, gracias a esto encuentran al joven baterista de origen cubano-colombiano nacido en Miami, Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, quien a partir de ese momento ser\u00eda pieza clave de la historia del grupo. La vida de Sombrero Verde continu\u00f3 hasta 1986, cuando el guitarrista Gustavo Orozco decide tambi\u00e9n abandonar la agrupaci\u00f3n concentrarse en sus estudios acad\u00e9micos. Al quedar de nuevo el grupo como cuarteto, Fher decide cerrar el libro de Sombrero Verde y formar una nueva banda que fusionara el rock, pop y los ritmos latinos. En esa \u00e9poca, comenz\u00f3 en M\u00e9xico el movimiento denominado \"Rock en tu idioma\", una estrategia comercial de algunas compa\u00f1\u00edas discogr\u00e1ficas encaminada a llamar la atenci\u00f3n de los j\u00f3venes para desarrollar m\u00fasica rock en espa\u00f1ol. La tendencia, importada de Argentina y Espa\u00f1a, estaba avalada por el trabajo pionero de grupos como Soda Stereo, Enanitos Verdes, Mecano, Nacha Pop, La Uni\u00f3n, Radio Futura, Hombres G y Zas (La banda de Miguel Mateos); como consecuencia de ello, aparecieron varias bandas mexicanas formadas por j\u00f3venes con influencias musicales de grupos norteamericanos y europeos. Surgieron as\u00ed las bandas l\u00edderes del movimiento en M\u00e9xico: Caifanes, Maldita Vecindad, Caf\u00e9 Tacvba y, entre ellas, Man\u00e1, quienes lograr\u00edan \u00e9xito no solo a nivel local sino tambi\u00e9n internacionalmente. Man\u00e1 En medio de este naciente movimiento, la banda adopt\u00f3 el nombre que le dar\u00eda proyecci\u00f3n internacional: \u00abMan\u00e1\u00bb, que fue elegido por el significado que tiene la palabra en polinesio: \u00abenerg\u00eda positiva\u00bb. La alineaci\u00f3n qued\u00f3 conformada por Fher Olvera como vocalista, los hermanos Ulises y Ju\u00e1n Diego Calleros, en guitarra y bajo respectivamente, y Alex Gonz\u00e1lez en la bater\u00eda. En 1987, el grupo firm\u00f3 con la discogr\u00e1fica Polygram y public\u00f3 Man\u00e1, disco que afianzar\u00eda el movimiento Rock en tu idioma. De este trabajo se desprendieron los sencillos: \u201cRobot\u201d, \u201cMentirosa\u201d, \u201cMueve tus caderas\u201d y \u201cQueremos paz\u201d. Con esta producci\u00f3n el grupo tuvo escaso \u00e9xito, y no dej\u00f3 del todo satisfechos a los integrantes; diversos roces con la disquera por el deseo de mantener la esencia e identidad del grupo, llevaron a Man\u00e1 a pedir su carta de retiro de Polygram. Falta Amor Con un futuro incierto el grupo trabaja en nuevos demos y busca una nueva compa\u00f1\u00eda discogr\u00e1fica, logrando firmar con Warner Music M\u00e9xico. Tras la mala experiencia del primer disco, Fher y Alex estaban concientes de los riesgos que implica ponerse en las manos de un productor que no entend\u00eda el concepto del grupo ni su propuesta art\u00edstica, por lo que optaron por iniciarse en un camino del cual no se han apartado desde entonces: asumir ellos la producci\u00f3n de todos sus discos. Con esa idea en mente graban el \u00e1lbum Falta Amor (1989), que no obtiene \u00e9xito sino hasta un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s de su lanzamiento gracias al sencillo \u201cRayando el sol\u201d, el cual se convierte en el primer gran \u00e9xito para Man\u00e1; los sencillos \u201cPerdido en un barco\u201d, \u201cEstoy agotado\u201d y \u201cBusc\u00e1ndola\u201d llegan tambi\u00e9n al gusto de la gente. El grupo realiza 112 presentaciones en M\u00e9xico y su primer concierto multitudinario fuera de las fronteras de su pa\u00eds, en el Coliseo General Rumi\u00f1ahui de Quito, Ecuador. Fue gracias a esta presentaci\u00f3n que el grupo se dio cuenta del potencial que la banda pod\u00eda tener a nivel internacional. \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os? En 1991 Man\u00e1 enfrenta el primer cambio en su alineaci\u00f3n con la salida de Ulises Calleros, quien desde entonces se dedica a representar al grupo. Ello signific\u00f3 la llegada de dos nuevos miembros: el tecladista Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez y el guitarrista C\u00e9sar \u201cEl Vampiro\u201d L\u00f3pez. Con esa nueva formaci\u00f3n graban en Los \u00c1ngeles en el a\u00f1o 1992 \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os?, \u00e1lbum que constituye un aut\u00e9ntico parteaguas en la historia del grupo y en la del rock en espa\u00f1ol, manteni\u00e9ndose durante 97 semanas en la lista Billboard de los discos m\u00e1s vendidos de Latinoam\u00e9rica. Ocho sencillos de esta producci\u00f3n encabezaron las listas de popularidad en toda la Am\u00e9rica hispanoparlante y se han convertido en temas cl\u00e1sicos de su repertorio: \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d, \u201c\u00bfD\u00f3nde jugar\u00e1n los ni\u00f1os?\u201d, \u201cDe pies a cabeza\u201d, \u201cComo te deseo\u201d, \u201cOye mi amor\u201d, \u201cC\u00f3mo diablos\u201d, \u201cTe llor\u00e9 un r\u00edo\u201d y \u201cMe vale\u201d. La globalizaci\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 inicia en 1993, con una maquinaria promocional de primer nivel y una serie de 268 conciertos en m\u00e1s de 17 pa\u00edses. La gira fue un \u00e9xito y posicion\u00f3 a la banda entre la comunidad latina de Estados Unidos y en mercados como Chile, Ecuador, Per\u00fa, Bolivia, Venezuela y Argentina. Argentina y Espa\u00f1a, dos territorios hist\u00f3ricamente dif\u00edciles de alcanzar para artistas latinos no nativos, fueron tambi\u00e9n conquistados por el fen\u00f3meno de Man\u00e1 gracias a que el tema \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d alcanz\u00f3 el primer lugar en las listas de popularidad de ambos pa\u00edses, lo cual no hab\u00eda sucedido en 26 a\u00f1os. Este mismo tema se hace merecedor al premio MTV Latino Video Music Award como mejor video del a\u00f1o. En Abril de 1994 y por diferencias art\u00edsticas y profesionales, Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez y C\u00e9sar \u201cEl Vampiro\u201d L\u00f3pez dejan Man\u00e1 a la mitad de la gira. Por un segundo, el futuro de la banda y su tour estuvo en duda, pero pronto demostraron que la formula de la agrupaci\u00f3n y su esencia segu\u00eda intacta. Para acabar la gira contrataron a los m\u00fasicos Ju\u00e1n Carlos Toribio como apoyo en teclados, Gustavo Orozco en guitarra y Sheila R\u00edos en coros. Man\u00e1 en Vivo Con su nuevo y bien merecido estatus en la escena del rock pop latino internacional, el tr\u00edo compuesto por Fher, Alex y Ju\u00e1n lanzaron el disco Man\u00e1 en Vivo (1994). La idea de lanzar un disco de sus conciertos surge como un medio para capturar la energ\u00eda y revivir cada momento, cada gota de adrenalina y sudor que forman parte de la magia de las presentaciones de Mana. El disco fue grabado entre Agosto y Septiembre de 1994, durante las presentaciones del grupo en el Universal Amphitheatre de Los \u00c1ngeles, la Sports Arena en San Diego, el Aragon Theatre en Chicago, el Teatro Gran Rex en Buenos Aires, el Estadio de Chile en Santiago y la Sala Est\u00e1ndar en Barcelona. Una vez m\u00e1s, la revista Billboard los galardon\u00f3 con el premio al mejor \u00c1lbum Rock/Pop del A\u00f1o. Cuando Los \u00c1ngeles Lloran Deseosos de regresar a su formaci\u00f3n original como cuarteto, Man\u00e1 tiene el tercer y \u00faltimo cambio en su alineaci\u00f3n. La banda audiciona a m\u00e1s de 80 guitarristas de M\u00e9xico, Argentina, Chile y Estados Unidos, hasta que finalmente en Aguascalientes, M\u00e9xico, encuentran al talento que buscaban en Sergio Vall\u00edn, cuya sorprendente sensibilidad, t\u00e9cnica y versatilidad vienen a darle un lustre distinto al sonido de las guitarras en las producciones de la banda. Con esa nueva formaci\u00f3n y con demos hechos en Guadalajara y Puerto Vallarta, graban y editan el disco Cuando los \u00c1ngeles Lloran (1995) entre Los \u00c1ngeles y el puerto jalisciense. Esta producci\u00f3n, lanzada tres a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su exitoso \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os? se distingue por una notable evoluci\u00f3n en la l\u00edrica y el sonido del grupo. Los sencillos \u201cD\u00e9jame entrar\u201d, \u201cNo ha parado de llover\u201d y \u201cHundido en un rinc\u00f3n\u201d no solo representaron un rotundo \u00e9xito en la radio, sino que los videos correspondientes tuvieron una gran rotaci\u00f3n en los canales de m\u00fasica y ganaron diversos premios por su calidad. El disco les permiti\u00f3 una primera nominaci\u00f3n al premio Grammy Americano, el m\u00e1s importante en la industria discogr\u00e1fica. Con el estandarte de un nuevo disco el grupo inicia su nueva gira el 12 de mayo de 1995, con un total de 52 conciertos realizados en 13 pa\u00edses, esto en un per\u00edodo de menos de cinco meses, lo cual mostr\u00f3 el fen\u00f3meno que para ese momento ya significaba Man\u00e1. Durante su visita a Espa\u00f1a en ese mismo a\u00f1o, el grupo se present\u00f3 en la plaza de Las Ventas junto a Revolver y La Uni\u00f3n, donde el p\u00fablico recibi\u00f3 a la banda con los brazos abiertos. La gira Cu\u00e1ndo Los \u00c1ngeles Lloran signific\u00f3 al grupo presentaciones con sold out completos en cada plaza que visitaban. Otros impresionantes logros fueron la inclusi\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 en el festival de Jazz de Montreaux y la conferencia Midem, que tuvieron lugar en Suiza y Francia, respectivamente, una proeza nunca antes alcanzada. Tambi\u00e9n participan con un tema en la pel\u00edcula My Family, a petici\u00f3n del prestigiado director Francis Ford Coppola. Man\u00e1 siempre ha expresado su inter\u00e9s en los problemas que el planeta est\u00e1 enfrentando en materia de ecolog\u00eda, por lo que en Septiembre de 1995 crearon la Fundaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica Selva Negra, con el objetivo de crear conciencia sobre el tema. (www.selvanegra.org.mx) A mediados de Abril de 1996, el grupo continu\u00f3 una extensa y esperada gira por toda la Rep\u00fablica Mexicana. Durante la segunda mitad de 1996 la banda se aventur\u00f3 en una gira de 17 conciertos con localidades agotadas en Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, Santa Barbara, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, New Orle\u00e1ns, Sacramento, Miami, San Jose, Phoenix, San Bernardino, Tucson, Anaheim y las Vegas. Dicho tour les vali\u00f3 importantes art\u00edculos en prestigiosas revistas como Rolling Stone, Time, Details, People Magazine, Newsweek y Pollstar. El 7 de Septiembre de 1996 la banda se presenta dos noches con localidades agotadas en el James Knight Center de Miami, logro nunca antes alcanzado por una banda de rock pop latina. La producci\u00f3n le vali\u00f3 al grupo el premio Billboard al Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock/Pop Latino, lo cual fijo un record de 6 premios Billboard recibidos en un per\u00edodo de 3 a\u00f1os. Despu\u00e9s de sus presentaciones en Estados Unidos la banda regresa a M\u00e9xico, donde dan 2 exitosos conciertos en la Plaza de Toros de su natal Guadalajara. Durante su estad\u00eda en dicha ciudad, la banda dio una conferencia de prensa para anunciar el lanzamiento de su website; mientras la conferencia ten\u00eda lugar el sitio recibi\u00f3 6000 entradas, una cifra sorprendente tomando en cuenta la \u00e9poca. En Marzo de 1997 la reconocida revista americana especializada en bateristas y la industria de este instrumento, Modern Drummer, public\u00f3 un art\u00edculo sobre Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, en la cual se\u00f1ala a Man\u00e1 como todo un suceso dentro del rock pop latino en Estados Unidos, a la par de reconocer a Alex como uno de los mejores bateristas a nivel mundial dentro del g\u00e9nero. 11 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, en Marzo de 2008 Alex aparece de nuevo en la revista, pero esta vez en una extensa entrevista. Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos Tras una favorable experiencia de su anterior grabaci\u00f3n en Puerto Vallarta, sitio important\u00edsimo en el atlas creativo de Man\u00e1, el grupo decide regresar para hacer los demos y la grabaci\u00f3n de su pr\u00f3xima producci\u00f3n. As\u00ed, con la ambici\u00f3n de crear m\u00fasica en un ambiente donde el agua, elemento vital como pocos, tuviera una presencia contundente, Man\u00e1 renta una hermosa casa con vista a Bah\u00eda de Banderas, en Conchas Chinas, y graban el disco Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos en 1997. Incontables atardeceres frente al oc\u00e9ano fueron el marco id\u00f3neo para concebir Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, \u00e1lbum producido tambi\u00e9n por Fher y Alex, en colaboraci\u00f3n con Benny Faccone. El resultado fue una energ\u00e9tica mezcla de rock, pop y ritmos latinos que van desde el bosanova hasta el flamenco, pasando por la cadencia caribe\u00f1a del reggae. Importantes sencillos como \u201cEn el Muelle de San Bl\u00e1s\u201d, \u201cHechicera\u201d, \u201cClavado en un bar\u201d y \u201cComo dueles en los labios\u201d se desprenden de esta producci\u00f3n. El disco sali\u00f3 al mercado en Octubre de 1997 y fue lanzado simult\u00e1neamente en 36 pa\u00edses; debut\u00f3 en primer lugar en el Billboard Hot Latin 50 Chart. La producci\u00f3n son\u00f3 fuerte tambi\u00e9n en la Uni\u00f3n Americana y Man\u00e1 se convirti\u00f3 en la primera banda de rock en espa\u00f1ol que se present\u00f3 en El Show de Kathie Lee & Regis, emisi\u00f3n l\u00edder de audiencia en la televisi\u00f3n estadounidense. El 30 de Enero de 1998 la banda inici\u00f3 su gira m\u00e1s ambiciosa, Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos World Tour en Chile, para posteriormente visitar Uruguay y M\u00e9xico. Tras una pausa de 4 semanas debido a que el baterista, Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, fue diagnosticado con hepatitis A, el grupo reanud\u00f3 la gira por su natal M\u00e9xico, donde ofrecieron 44 conciertos. Entre las presentaciones que destacan en la gira Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos Tour 98 se encuentran las de Bolivia, Colombia, Per\u00fa, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Chile, Puerto Rico, Honduras, y El Salvador. Otras de las presentaciones m\u00e1s importantes son los conciertos en el Auditorio Nacional, recinto en el que Man\u00e1 rompi\u00f3 r\u00e9cord, pues fue la primera ocasi\u00f3n en que una banda de este g\u00e9nero se presenta siete veces consecutivas sobre este escenario. De vital importancia para la carrera de Man\u00e1 fue ser la primera banda de rock en espa\u00f1ol firmada por la agencia Creative Artist Agency (CAA), con ello Man\u00e1 se un\u00eda a la importante lista de representados que inclu\u00eda a Bon Jovi, AC/DC, Alanis Morissette, Eric Clapton, Madonna, Depeche Mode, Santana, Bob Dylan, George Michael, entre otros. Su primer gira de la mano con CAA inici\u00f3 el 21 de agosto de 1998 en Los \u00c1ngeles, CA y cubri\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 30 ciudades con un total de 36 shows en arenas y anfiteatros, la mayor\u00eda de ellas con llenos totales. Importantes presentaciones tuvieron lugar en el Universal Amphitheatre de Los \u00c1ngeles y en el Rosemont Horizon Arena, donde rompen record al ser el primer grupo de rock pop latino en agotar localidades. Este tour fue el m\u00e1s grande realizado por un grupo de rock pop latino en Estados Unidos. La banda es nominada por sexta vez consecutiva a los premios que otorga la revista Billboard por Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, dentro del rubro Mejor \u00c1lbum Pop Rock del A\u00f1o, llev\u00e1ndose el cotizado premio. En diciembre de 1998, Man\u00e1 fue nominado por segunda vez a los Premios Grammy Americanos en la categor\u00eda Mejor \u00c1lbum Latino de Rock/Alternativo por Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, premio al que se hicieron merecedores el 24 de febrero de 1999. Este es el primer Grammy otorgado a una banda de rock pop mexicana. Tambi\u00e9n en diciembre de 1998, Fher recibe una invitaci\u00f3n por parte de Carlos Santana para participar en su nuevo material discogr\u00e1fico. Fher compone \u00a8Coraz\u00f3n espinado\u00a8, tema con el cual se abren fronteras para la m\u00fasica latina, tras colocarse este sencillo en los primeros lugares de pa\u00edses europeos, asi\u00e1ticos, y americanos. La grabaci\u00f3n se realiz\u00f3 en las ciudades de Los \u00c1ngeles y San Francisco CA, en donde naci\u00f3 una gran amistad entre ambos m\u00fasicos. Como resultado de esta colaboraci\u00f3n, Alex y Fher reciben el premio Grammy como productores y escritores de dicha canci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de realizar junto a Santana una gira por Estados Unidos y M\u00e9xico. El grupo comparti\u00f3 arenas, auditorios y estadios de la Uni\u00f3n Americana con Carlos Santana, en una extensa gira que dar\u00eda comienzo el 29 de julio de 1999 en la ciudad de Houston TX, seguida de varias presentaciones por diferentes ciudades de ese estado, para continuar en Phoenix, Tucson, San Diego, Anaheim, Mountain View, Concord, Sacramento, Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Boise, y Denver. Abrir\u00eda los conciertos el grupo Ozomatli, seguidos de Man\u00e1 y Carlos Santana alternando el orden de estos en cada una de sus presentaciones. Conciertos hist\u00f3ricos se llevan a cabo en el Arrowhead Pond en Anaheim, donde el grupo realiza cuatro shows sold out. La combinaci\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 y Carlos Santana dej\u00f3 sin duda huella en el mercado de rock en espa\u00f1ol, como uno de los acontecimientos m\u00e1s grandes de la historia del g\u00e9nero en los Estados Unidos. En total Man\u00e1 y Santana hab\u00edan realizado 43 shows por Estados Unidos, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, Guadalajara, y Monterrey al finalizar la gira en diciembre de 1999. MTV Unplugged La cadena de videos MTV llevaba varios a\u00f1os solicitando a Man\u00e1 su participaci\u00f3n en la serie de grabaciones Unplugged, sin que la banda hubiese podido acceder a la petici\u00f3n debido a los compromisos que le significaban sus grabaciones y extensas giras. Finalmente se dieron las condiciones para el proyecto, por lo que el 9 de Marzo de 1999 la banda graba Man\u00e1 Unplugged en Miami ante un \u00edntimo publico de 70 afortunados fans. En dicho material el grupo incluye \u00e9xitos de su repertorio m\u00e1s 3 covers en modalidad ac\u00fastica; tambi\u00e9n contiene el interludio musical \u00a8Coladito\u00a8, duelo de percusi\u00f3n entre Alex G\u00f3nzalez y el m\u00fasico invitado Lu\u00eds Conte, donde se pude apreciar la destreza de ambos ejecutantes. El 22 de Junio de 1999 el material se lanza a la venta simult\u00e1neamente en todo el continente americano, alcanzando el primer lugar de ventas en el TOP 50 Latino de la revista Billboard, con lo cual la banda repite la haza\u00f1a de ser el \u00fanico grupo de rock latino en lograrlo. Hasta el momento, este disco sigue siendo uno de los m\u00e1s vendidos para la cadena de televisi\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de que fue el primer artista latino en lanzar un material de este tipo (CD/DVD). El primer sencillo que se desprendi\u00f3 de esta producci\u00f3n, tema original de Juan Gabriel, \u201cSe me olvid\u00f3 otra vez\u201d permaneci\u00f3 durante m\u00e1s de 5 semanas consecutivas en el primer lugar en las listas de radio de gran parte de M\u00e9xico y Latinoam\u00e9rica. \u201cTe solt\u00e9 la rienda\u201d, del compositor Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez fue otro exitos\u00edsimo sencillo que se desprendi\u00f3 de esta grabaci\u00f3n. A principios de enero del 2000, Man\u00e1 recibe la noticia de su nominaci\u00f3n a los premios Grammy en la categor\u00eda de Mejor \u00c1lbum de Pop Latino por su disco MTV Unplugged, esta era la tercera vez consecutiva que el grupo estaba nominado a tan afamados premios. La banda con muchas ganas de tocar arranca una gira por Sudam\u00e9rica y el Caribe el 17 de Marzo de 2000, visitando pa\u00edses como Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Uruguay, Puerto Rico y Republica Dominicana; las presentaciones en la capital Argentina lograron un \u00e9xito y expectaci\u00f3n impresionante, tras ofrecer un concierto en el Estadio Ferro de Buenos Aires a tan solo unas semanas de haber realizado 2 conciertos previos en el Luna Park de esa misma ciudad; lo mismo sucedi\u00f3 en el estadio Santa Laura, en Santiago de Chile. El resto de la gira luci\u00f3 con llenos totales en todos los lugares en donde Man\u00e1 se present\u00f3. A mediados del mes de abril en la ciudad de Miami, se celebraron los premios Billboard a la M\u00fasica Latina, en los cuales Man\u00e1 recibe 2 premios importantes, el primero al Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Pop Latino por su producci\u00f3n MTV Unplugged, y el segundo premio para la Fundaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica Selva Negra, denominado Spirit of Hope el cual se entrega \u00fanicamente a aquellos artistas que se han destacado por realizar acciones altruistas en pro del medio ambiente y de los derechos humanos. En estas mismas fechas el grupo recibe un reconocimiento que por primera vez se les otorga, el premio que concede la cadena de renta y venta de videos y m\u00fasica m\u00e1s grande de los Estados Unidos, el Block Buster Award por Mejor Artista Latino. En el mes de Junio Man\u00e1 comienza su Gira por Espa\u00f1a y las Canarias en un tour denominado Tourriata, visitando ciudades como: Tenerife, Pamplona, Zaragoza, Toledo, Santiago, Burgos, Palencia, Zamora, Barcelona, Madrid, Victoria, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Gijon, La Coru\u00f1a, Elche, San Javier Murcia, Valencia, Sevilla, San Fernando y M\u00e1laga. Cabe mencionar que en la capital espa\u00f1ola, las dos fechas en la plaza de toros Las Ventas fueron llenos totales, lo cual era una haza\u00f1a dif\u00edcil a\u00fan para los artistas de origen espa\u00f1ol, y un logro nunca antes alcanzado por una banda o artista latino. En el resto de la gira que realizaron a lo largo y ancho de la Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica lograron igualmente ventas totales. En el mes de septiembre el grupo asiste a la primera entrega del Grammy Latino, en donde junto con Carlos Santana interpretaron el tema \u201cCoraz\u00f3n espinado\u201d, siendo \u00e9ste unos de los momentos m\u00e1s memorables de la noche. En dicha ceremonia Man\u00e1 resulto ganador de 3 Grammy por su participaci\u00f3n en el \u00e1lbum del guitarrista. Durante su estancia en la ciudad de Los \u00c1ngeles, Man\u00e1 es invitado a interpretar el tema \u201cCoraz\u00f3n espinado\u201d al lado de Carlos Santana en el #1 talk show de los Estados Unidos \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d con Jay Leno, quien reconoci\u00f3 a Man\u00e1 como el grupo de rock pop latino m\u00e1s importante. La banda no para y lanza el compilatorio titulado Grandes Man\u00e1, cuya edici\u00f3n se hizo solamente para Europa y Escandinavia; a escasas semanas de haber salido a la venta ocup\u00f3 las primeras posiciones de la radio principalmente de la Pen\u00ednsula It\u00e1lica con el tema \u201cEn el Muelle de San Blas\u201d. Con este suceso Man\u00e1 visita en Noviembre del 2001 por primera vez Italia, en una gira promocional en la cual realizan un showcase en Mil\u00e1n para medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, personalidades y p\u00fablico en general. Italia adopt\u00f3 a Man\u00e1, la barrera del idioma se rompe y entran directo a los primeros lugares de la radio, apareciendo en las primeras planas de la prensa nacional Italiana. Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor A principios de 2002 la banda se encierra para componer y hacer demos de lo que ser\u00eda su pr\u00f3ximo disco de estudio a tres a\u00f1os del lanzamiento de Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos. Lanzan Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor en Junio de 2002, disco en \u00e9l que se muestra la b\u00fasqueda de la banda por mezclar su esencia con el sonido de rock de los sesentas y setentas, adem\u00e1s de otras fusiones de m\u00fasica latina. El resultado fue una colecci\u00f3n de grabaciones completamente energ\u00e9ticas, con un sonido que privilegia el de las guitarras pero que no renuncia a la b\u00fasqueda y la fusi\u00f3n. Este, su sexto \u00e1lbum de estudio, fue grabado en su totalidad en Los \u00c1ngeles, entre Febrero y Mayo de 2002 y cont\u00f3 con la participaci\u00f3n de Carlos Santana y su guitarra en el tema \u201cJusticia, Tierra y Libertad\u201d, as\u00ed como la de Rub\u00e9n Blades en \u201cS\u00e1banas fr\u00edas\u201d. Cabe destacar que el guitarrista del grupo, Sergio Vall\u00edn, particip\u00f3 cantando el tema \u201c\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 te vas?\u201d, dedicado a sus padres. Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor alcanz\u00f3 el primer lugar en ventas en Espa\u00f1a, Latinoam\u00e9rica y Estados Unidos durante cinco semanas consecutivas. Tuvo como sencillos m\u00e1s destacados \u201c\u00c1ngel de amor\u201d, \u201cEres mi religi\u00f3n\u201d y \u201cMariposa traicionera\u201d. Gracias al \u00e9xito obtenido en Italia, el cantante Zucchero los invita a participar en la canci\u00f3n \u201cBaila morena\u201d, dueto que resulta todo un \u00e9xito tanto en Am\u00e9rica como en Europa. Man\u00e1 le devuelve el gesto al cantante al invitarlo a participar en la canci\u00f3n \u201cEres mi religi\u00f3n\u201d pero ahora en italiano, que luego fue incluida en una edici\u00f3n especial del disco Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor editado en Europa. El 29 de Septiembre de 2002 Man\u00e1 se aventura a una nueva gira de dos a\u00f1os que los pondr\u00eda como nunca antes al mercado internacional. La gira llev\u00f3 al grupo no solo a ciudades de Estados Unidos, M\u00e9xico, Latinoam\u00e9rica y Espa\u00f1a, sino a nuevas plazas como Roma, Mil\u00e1n, Par\u00eds, Berl\u00edn, Eifel, Nuremberg, Munich, Stuggart, Hamburgo, R\u00edo de Janeiro y Sao Paolo. La primera incursi\u00f3n de la banda en el dif\u00edcil mercado brasile\u00f1o se dio con llenos totales; lo mismo sucedi\u00f3 en sus presentaciones en Italia, Francia y Alemania donde alcanzaron un lugar entre los 30 mejores \u00e1lbumes respecto a ventas. En total, el grupo realiz\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 100 conciertos en 24 pa\u00edses. Durante su estancia por Europa, la banda particip\u00f3 en el especial Pavarotti & Friends al lado de Zucchero, donde se presentaron con estrellas de la talla de Bono, Eric Clapton, Lionel Ritchie, Queen, Deep Purple, Ricky Martin y Andrea Bocceli. Man\u00e1 recibe dos nominaciones en la 4ta entrega de los Grammy Latino que se realizaron en Miami el 3 de Septiembre de 2003, en las categor\u00edas de Mejor Ingenier\u00eda de Grabaci\u00f3n para un \u00c1lbum y Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock por un D\u00fao o Grupo, llev\u00e1ndose esta \u00faltima presea. Esenciales Man\u00e1 El 18 de Noviembre de 2003 el grupo, cansado de tantos a\u00f1os de trabajo, decide tomar un a\u00f1o sab\u00e1tico y aprovechan para lanzar los recopilatorios Esenciales en tres versiones: Sol, Luna y Eclipse, que incluyen sus temas m\u00e1s exitosos y otras colaboraciones de la banda, como por ejemplo la versi\u00f3n de \u201cFool in the rain\u201d, canci\u00f3n original de Led Zeppelin incluida en el tributo Encomium al legendario grupo ingl\u00e9s y donde Man\u00e1 fue el \u00fanico artista latino invitado. Tambi\u00e9n se encuentra en la compilaci\u00f3n la canci\u00f3n in\u00e9dita \u201cTe llevar\u00e9 al cielo\u201d, tema que se convirti\u00f3 en todo un \u00e9xito, alcanzando r\u00e1pidamente los primeros lugares de popularidad en radio y video. A manera de agradecimiento a sus seguidores, deciden poner a la venta el 12 de Diciembre de 2004 el DVD llamado Acceso Total, el cual incluye im\u00e1genes del tour Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor (2002-2003) m\u00e1s escenas nunca antes vistas en camerinos, permiti\u00e9ndole a los fans tener \u2018acceso total\u2019 a la experiencia que vive Man\u00e1 en sus giras. Amar es Combatir Casi 5 a\u00f1os hab\u00edan pasado desde el \u00faltimo disco de estudio de la banda, Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor, por lo que ya corr\u00edan rumores y especulaciones sobre la separaci\u00f3n del grupo. Lo que nadie sab\u00eda era que tras su a\u00f1o sab\u00e1tico y desde principios de 2005, Man\u00e1 se reuni\u00f3 para empezar a componer su s\u00e9ptimo disco de estudio, Amar es Combatir. En Febrero de 2006 la banda decide viajar a Miami, ciudad siempre vibrante, abrazada por el ambiente tropical y con una esencia latina que se respira en el aire, comuni\u00f3n id\u00f3nea para inspirar la grabaci\u00f3n de este CD en el que la banda llev\u00f3 a cabo una fusi\u00f3n de rock, pop, m\u00fasica latina, reggae, hasta drum and bass. Producido por Fher y Alex, al igual que sus discos anteriores, Amar es Combatir fue lanzado el 22 de agosto de 2006 y es editado en 40 pa\u00edses alrededor del mundo, alcanzando el n\u00famero 4 en el Top 200 \u00c1lbumes de la revista Billboard en los Estados Unidos, r\u00e9cord solamente alcanzado para una producci\u00f3n enteramente en espa\u00f1ol por el \u00e1lbum Fijaci\u00f3n Oral Vol. 1 de Shakira. Su primer sencillo, \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d, permanece durante ocho semanas consecutivas en el primer lugar de los charts latinos de radio y es nombrado entre los medios latinos m\u00e1s reconocidos de la uni\u00f3n Americana como uno de los tracks m\u00e1s escuchados y premiados del 2006. Los sencillos que le siguieron, \u201cBendita tu luz\u201d (a d\u00fao con Ju\u00e1n Luis Guerra) y \u201cManda una se\u00f1al\u201d se posicionan tambi\u00e9n en el primer lugar de las listas de popularidad. A estos se agregar\u00eda un quinto sencillo, \u201cEl rey tibur\u00f3n\u201d, lo cual es un logro a destacar ya que es cada vez menos frecuente que de una producci\u00f3n se desprendan 5 sencillos, dada la complicada situaci\u00f3n por la que atraviesa la industria. En noviembre de 2006 el grupo participa en la 7ma edici\u00f3n del Grammy Latino, donde adem\u00e1s de actuar junto a Ju\u00e1n Luis Guerra con un excelente performance de sus \u00e9xitos, que les vali\u00f3 una sentida ovaci\u00f3n de parte de los asistentes al evento y que fue uno de los momentos cl\u00edmax de la velada, reciben un homenaje por su trayectoria art\u00edstica y logros en la m\u00fasica. En febrero de 2007 y tras recibir 5 nominaciones a los premios Billboard Latino, 4 nominaciones a los premios Lo Nuestro y una al Grammy Americano como Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Alternativo o Urbano, Man\u00e1 inicia su gira Amar Es Combatir World Tour, con la mayor producci\u00f3n que haya tenido el grupo hasta el momento (m\u00e1s de 60 toneladas de equipo), la cual los llevar\u00eda a dar 116 conciertos durante un per\u00edodo de un a\u00f1o y medio. Los conciertos de Man\u00e1 en Estados Unidos y Puerto Rico, incluyeron shows en ciudades como San Diego, Los \u00c1ngeles, Laredo, Houston, Corpus Christi, Miami, Orlando, Nueva York, Washington, Chicago, Atlanta y San Ju\u00e1n de Puerto Rico. Man\u00e1 se convierte en la primera banda de rock pop en espa\u00f1ol en llenar por tres noches (dos consecutivas) el Madison Square Garden de Nueva York. Destacan tambi\u00e9n sus cuatro conciertos sold out consecutivos en el Staple Center de Los \u00c1ngeles, tres noches sold out en el Miami American Airlines Arena, tres m\u00e1s en el Toyota Center de Houston y cuatro sold out en el Coliseo Jos\u00e9 M. Agrelot de Puerto Rico. Adem\u00e1s de reunirse en Washington D.C. con la senadora estadounidense Hillary Clinton para compartir opiniones sobre el medio ambiente y migraci\u00f3n, Man\u00e1 recibe un reconocimiento por las m\u00e1s de 450,000 descargas de su ringtone \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d. Su gira por Latinoam\u00e9rica incluy\u00f3 conciertos en Chile, Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Panam\u00e1, Venezuela, Colombia, Per\u00fa, Brasil y Rep\u00fablica Dominicana. El grupo toc\u00f3 en grandes foros, de los cuales destacan los conciertos del grupo en Argentina: tres presentaciones en el Estadio Velez de Buenos Aires as\u00ed como en el Estadio Chateau Carrera de C\u00f3rdoba, el Estadio Central en Rosario y el Estadio Malvinas en Mendoza. Otras presentaciones de gran relevancia fueron: Estadio Defensores del Chaco en Asunci\u00f3n, Estadio del Ej\u00e9rcito en Guatemala, Estadio M\u00e1gico en San Salvador, Estadio de Futbol de Managhua, Estadio Ol\u00edmpico de Caracas, el Parque Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar en Bogot\u00e1, Estadio Alberto Spencer en Guayaquil, Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Atahualpa en Quito, Estadio Alejandro Serrano en Cuenca, Credicard Hall en Sao Paulo, Citibank Hall en Rio de Janeiro, Estadio Gigantinho en Porto Alegre y el Estadio Quisquella en Santo Domingo. Durante Junio y Julio de 2007 llevan su gira a Espa\u00f1a, donde rompen records al posicionarse como el artista latino de mayor convocatoria en la madre patria, al vender todas las localidades para sus conciertos en 15 provincias: Zaragoza, Pamplona, Bilbao, Gij\u00f3n, Santiago, Le\u00f3n, Barcelona, Madrid, Murcia, Alicante, Albacete, M\u00e1laga, Sevilla, Las Palmas y Tenerife. Cabe destacar la nominaci\u00f3n del grupo en los premios World Music Awards, realizados en M\u00f3naco, Francia. Este premio se entrega de acuerdo a las ventas que un artista logr\u00f3 durante un a\u00f1o y donde Man\u00e1 comparti\u00f3 escenario al lado de artistas como Celine Dion, Avril Lavigne, Rihanna, Patty Labelle, entre otros. Entre los premios m\u00e1s destacados que la banda obtuvo por esta producci\u00f3n se encuentra un Grammy Americano en el rubro de Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Alternativo o Urbano, 3 galardones Lo Nuestro por \u00c1lbum de Rock del A\u00f1o, Artista Rock del A\u00f1o y canci\u00f3n Rock del A\u00f1o; 2 Billboard Latinos por \u00c1lbum Rock Alternativo del A\u00f1o y tema Pop Airplay del A\u00f1o de D\u00fao o Grupo. Arde El Cielo La impresionante respuesta que tuvo la gira Amar Es Combatir World Tour fue una experiencia sorprendente para la banda, por lo que decidieron capturar esa energ\u00eda, esa adrenalina, en una grabaci\u00f3n con la cual sus seguidores pudieran recordar y revivir esos momentos. As\u00ed, la banda decide grabar dos de sus cuatro presentaciones en el Coliseo Jos\u00e9 M. Agrelot de Puerto Rico en Marzo de 2007. El 29 de Abril del mismo a\u00f1o Man\u00e1 presenta en Los \u00c1ngeles el CD/DVD llamado Arde el Cielo, el cual fue grabado durante el Amar Es Combatir World Tour. El material contiene 12 temas en directo que representan y repasan la historia de Man\u00e1, desde \u201cRayando el sol\u201d a \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d, pasando por \u201cEl rey\u201d y canciones tan conocidas como \u201cEn el Muelle de San Blas\" o \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d, as\u00ed como dos temas in\u00e9ditos grabados en estudio. El primero de estos temas in\u00e9ditos es \"Si no te hubieras ido\", una canci\u00f3n de Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds ya versionada por otros artistas pero en la que Man\u00e1 supo poner su peculiar sello. El segundo tema in\u00e9dito del CD es \"Arde el cielo\" un tema compuesto por Fher y producido en conjunto con \u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez. Ambos temas serian hits en 2008. Los premios Billboard Latinos reconocieron esta producci\u00f3n otorg\u00e1ndole al grupo 4 galardones en las categor\u00edas de Canci\u00f3n Del A\u00f1o por Grupo o Duo y Tema Pop Airplay del A\u00f1o por \u201cSi no te hubieras ido\u201d, Album Pop de A\u00f1o por Grupo o D\u00fao y \u00c1lbum de rock Alternativo del A\u00f1o por Arde el Cielo.

A few years later Odetto was a semi-finalist for Guitar Center\u2019s King of the Blues. He was also featured in Guitar Player magazine as an artist to watch. After two successful stints with local bands, in 2016 he decided to pursue his dream of being a frontman.\n\nSince the move to fronting his own band, Tommy has been fortunate to be invited to perform at Bottlerock Napa 2018, and has opened for bands like, Chevy Metal, Tommy Castro, Coco Montoya, Y&T, Walter Trout, Uriah Heep, Ace Frehley, Trainwreck with Kyle Gass (Tenacious D) and Robin Trower to name a few. He is also a regular fill-in for Big Brother and the Holding Company. Now, only two years later, the Marin County native is celebrating his long-awaited sophomore release.\n\nCurses and Revelations is an unapologetic Rock and Roll record with themes of love lost, depression, addiction, recovery, self-discovery, and redemption. Five original melodic hard rock songs that highlight his raw, honest lyrics and peel back the curtain of the heart and mind of Odetto. Curses and Revelations features many standout guitar moments that are so passionate and soulful that it\u2019s as if we are witness to a musical truth serum. Recorded at Studio 606 and produced by John Lousteau and Ethan Turner, this new work touches on everything Odetto loves: Hard Rock, Blues, a 60's Pop mentality, with a Grunge era swagger.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9391342.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Rock And Roll, Blues, Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall"}, {"Address": "100 Yacht Club Dr, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "Melvin Seals and JGB", "ArtistBio": "In 1980 Melvin Seals joined the Jerry Garcia Band and remained a member until Jerry Garcia's untimely death in 1995.

Leyla, a multi-instrumentalist, is a cellist and singer whose distinctive sound is impossible to replicate.\n\n\nLeyla\u2019s music reflects her eclectic and diverse life experiences, projecting a respect for eloquent simplicity that is rarely achieved. Born in New York City to Haitian emigrant parents, Leyla was raised in suburban New Jersey. As a teenager, she relocated to Accra, Ghana for two years. Upon her return, she attended Smith College for a year before transferring to New York University where she studied cello performance and chamber music. Armed with Bach\u2019s Cello Suites, Leyla moved to New Orleans to play cello on the streets of the French Quarter.\n\n\nIt is the move to New Orleans that signaled a journey of musical and cultural discovery for Leyla. \u201cNew Orleans always felt like home to me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe more I learned about the history of Louisiana, its ties to Haiti and French speaking culture, the more sense of belonging I felt and continue to feel.\u201d Most recently, Leyla has fallen in love with the late Louisiana Creole fiddlers Canray Fontenot and B\u00e9b\u00e9 Carri\u00e8re and has explored their fiddling styles on the cello.\n\n\nLeyla\u2019s move to New Orleans also signaled a new stage in her career. It was while playing on the street that she caught the attention of Tim Duffy, the founder and director of the Music Maker Relief Foundation. He invited Leyla to join the Music Maker Relief Foundation family and introduced her to the Carolina Chocolate Drops, a renowned African-American string band. After appearing on the band\u2019s GRAMMY-nominated album Leaving Eden and touring extensively with the group, she now focuses on her solo career.\n\n\nVari-Colored Songs: A Tribute to Langston Hughes, Leyla\u2019s debut album, is set for a February 2014 release. The album, which has been years in the making for Leyla, was given a push after a successful Kickstarter campaign in which she surpassed her $5,000 goal by four times to ultimately raise over $20,000. Vari-Colored Songs consists of compositions she has written to Langston Hughes poetry, Haitian folk songs and original pieces. The album features musicians including Rhiannon Giddens and Hubby Jenkins of the Carolina Chocolate Drops as well as New Orleans\u2019 own Don Vappie on tenor banjo and Luke Winslow King on guitar.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9018395.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Folk", "OtherInfo": "Leyla McCalla", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse"}, {"Address": "1111 California St, San Francisco, CA 94108", "Artist": "The Good Ones", "ArtistBio": "For The Good Ones\u2019 new album, Rwanda, You Should Be Loved, bandleader Adrien Kazigira composed over forty songs. Most were meditations on his now thirteen-year-old daughter, Marie-Claire, and the life-threatening tumor that has afflicted her left-eye. The recording was done live without overdubs on Adrien\u2019s farm and was imbued with the passing of producer Ian Brennan\u2019s mother during the days that they were there together as well as a former founding band member recently having succumbed to his own demons.\n\nThe Good Ones renown is evidenced by the stellar musicians who collaborated with them on the new album: Wilco\u2019s Nels Cline, TV on the Radio\u2019s Tunde Adebimpe, Sleater-Kinney\u2019s Corin Tucker, My Bloody Valentine\u2019s Kevin Shields, and Fugazi\u2019s Joe Lally. In 2009, Grammy-winner Brennan (Tinariwen, Ramblin\u2019 Jack Elliott, Zomba Prison Project) traveled to Rwanda in search of local music with his Italian-Rwandan wife, filmmaker and photographer, Marilena Delli. After two weeks of crisscrossing the country and listening to countless artists, they met The Good Ones.\n\nFrom the moment he laid eyes on them, Brennan said he knew, \u201cWhat these guys do is precious and rare. Don't fuck it up!\u201d\n\nBeginning in 1978 when they were still children, the group\u2019s core members were taught music by Janvier\u2019s older brother who was blind and later perished in the 1994 genocide. They formed the band as a healing process after the genocide and the original trio\u2019s membership reunited Rwanda\u2019s three tribes (with one member each from the Tutsi, Hutu, and Abatwa tribes). It was an active attempt to seek out \u201cthe good ones,\u201d after having endured and witnessed unthinkable horrors.\n\nSince they live without electricity and have had little access to devices to reproduce musical recordings, The Good Ones\u2019 vocalizations are based on the singing traditions and dialect of their local immediate, agricultural district more than by outside and Western influences. Primary songwriter Adrien Kazigira interweaves intricate harmonies with co-singer, Janvier Havugimana, in a style frequently referred to as \u201cworker songs from the streets.\u201d With the musicians rural and remote hilltop origins, the harmonic similarities to American Bluegrass vocals is often eerie. Third member, Javan Mahoro, lends additional background vocals and percussion on select songs.\n\nThey utilize one-of-a-kind instruments in their music, often incorporating their own farming tools as percussion. Adrien continues to subsist as a farmer on the land that he and his children were born on, where he hid for months and survived the genocide, and the place where his wife died.\n\nTheir music and original songs have received great acclaim globally and the group has appeared on various BBC-radio programs, as well as on The Netherlands VPRO national-television breakfast show. In fact, they also have been publicly praised by the likes of legendary Led Zeppelin lead-singer, Robert Plant, and Grammy-winning, platinum-selling group, Mumford & Sons.\n\nIn 2010, The Good Ones released their debut album, Kigali Y Izahabu (\u201cKigali of Gold\u201d), making them the first Rwandan artists to distribute internationally songs in the language of Kinyarwanda. In 2015, they released their follow-up album, Rwanda Is My Home. It was named one of the \u201cTop 50 Albums of the Year\u201d by the Sunday London Times.\n\n2019 year marks the 25th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide during which over just a three- month period more than 12.5% of the population was killed, resulting in over 1-million deaths by conservative estimates.

Patrick and Jake met as children, but lived in different cities and saw little of one another before they reconnected in high school.\n\nThey got along immediately through their joy for busking (street performing), and pre-war American country and blues. \"Nobody I knew liked the same music,\" recalls Patrick. Jake came to San Francisco from Los Angeles to visit, bringing his guitar and baskets of recording gear. They spent that summer recording homeless street musicians with a mobile unit they lugged around the city, making copies of the recordings for the performers to sell.\n\nGuitarist Zac Sokolow had dropped out of high school and was busking on the street and working construction in Los Angeles when Jake saw him playing guitar, and convinced him to move in with them and start a band. They spent years digging through obscure records and arcane field recordings, teaching themselves banjo, fiddle, mandolin, harmonica, and slide guitar.\n\nPatrick calls this long immersion, during which he created and hosted a radio show, a \"purist\" phase. \"We were suspicious of modern rock music,\" he says. \"When we got together and formed a band, we had to make everything from scratch. We had no template. There was no band we wanted to be like. We were curious if we could create something brand new, summoning the spirit of old blues and country through what we'd learned firsthand, leaving nostalgia behind.\"\n\nThe Americans' debut album, due this year, seems to have achieved just that. \"They\u2019ve shape-shifted back into the modern-day rock and roll band,\" writes Cara Gibney (No Depression), \"writing contemporary music of their time, incorporating the kernel of their traditional roots, enhancing their rock and roll credentials with the emotional quality of music made generations earlier.\" Greg Vandy (American Standard Time) calls it \"distinctly American rock 'n' roll. Throaty, firin\u2019 on all cylinders, road trip rock, charged with intense composition choices that call to mind the history of roots music, from Chuck Berry and Tom Waits to The War On Drugs.\"\n\n\"We write our songs inside-out,\" says Patrick. \"We grab hold of something minuscule and primitive\u2014a simple turn of phrase or an unusual beat\u2014and try to build a song around it. It can be inefficient, and hard to write words over, but it's magical when it works.\"\n\nThe band's distinctive, powerful works have captured the attention of a number of stars. They've backed Nick Cave, Lucinda Williams, Ashley Monroe, and Devendra Banhart, and twice joined Ryan Bingham on national tours. Most recently they worked closely with Jack White and T Bone Burnett, joining Nas, Elton John, and Alabama Shakes in the PBS primetime series American Epic (airing summer 2017). Patrick went on to work on the film as an associate producer.\n\nTheir live show, honed over many hundreds of performances, is something to behold. Ron Wray (No Depression) writes, \"They\u2019re led by lead singer, guitarist Patrick Ferris, looking like James Dean but even better.... Jake Faulkner, with his dark black beard and jaunty hat, dances across stage, lifting his stand-up bass like a dancing partner.\" Chris Griffy (AXS) calls them \"straight up blue-collar rock and roll in the style of Bruce Springsteen and John Mellencamp.\" Steve Wildsmith (Daily Times) admires their \"anthemic guitar hooks and a heartland sense of urgency that\u2019s tailor made for road trips and late-night parties beneath a field of brilliant stars.\"", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8483388.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.398131, 37.779293], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Roll, Americana", "OtherInfo": "The Americans PLUS TBA at the Hotel Utah Saloon in San Francisco.

A fellow junkie and fan of French House and R&B-infused dance music, Perseus became a friend and mentor, the Splinter to Boots' Donatello. The label eventually disbanded but Boots has stayed true to his mission of making dance tracks that can\u2019t be confined to one style. Pete blends the music he loves - jazz, house, funk and soul - into songs that last longer than their runtime. Songs not just for DJs, but for everyone.\n\nAfter moving back to Brooklyn, Dougherty was introduced to the Anjunadeep team.

A student of the Delta's musical history, he is acutely aware of the musicians and the music that emerged from his corner of the world. \"I do think I have an old soul, that I've been here before,\" he says. \"I'm moving forward with one foot in the past.\"\n\n\"You don't see too many kids into blues music,\" says the nascent star. \"In my town, every kid wants to be a rapper \u2013 I wanted to do something no one else was doing.\" And although he grew up near the crossroads where Robert Johnson allegedly cut a deal with the devil, Kingfish insists he didn't do any of that to make his guitar howl the blues. \"I just practice all the time,\" he says, \"that's the only deal I made, and it's with myself.\"\n\nRecorded in Nashville and produced by two-time Grammy winner Tom Hambridge (Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi, Joe Louis Walker), KINGFISH showcases Ingram's blistering, raw and inspired guitar playing, soulful, deep vocals and songwriting. He tells stories with his solos, channeling the spirits of all the past masters while the music he makes is his own. He co-wrote eight of the album's 12 tracks. \"A lot of folks know me for my covers,\" he says. \"That's why it's important for me to release original music.\" The first radio single, Outside Of This Town, is a fierce statement of purpose \u2013 both musically and lyrically \u2013 from this rising star. The songs range from autobiographical (Been Here Before, Before I'm Old) to humorous (Trouble), and from white hot (It Ain't Right) to slow and searing (Love Ain't My Favorite Thing). His friend and mentor, Buddy Guy, adds vocals and guitar on Fresh Out while another friend, Keb Mo, brings his warm, conversational voice to Listen, and adds his rhythm and resonator guitars to six tracks.\n\nAlligator Records president Bruce Iglauer considers Kingfish a natural fit for the blues and roots label. \"At the age of 20, Kingfish is one of the most exciting and passionate young artists I've seen in many years. He's creating new music that feels like blues but doesn't copy what's ready been done. His roots are firmly in the Mississippi Delta, and you can hear that raw Delta honesty in his playing and singing. His guitar work is technically dazzling, but it's all about the emotions of the song and moving the audience. He's perfectly capable of crowd-pleasing shredding, but his music is remarkably mature. He knows which are the important notes, the notes that tell the story and grab the audience, and he leaves out the extraneous ones. He sings with the intensity and directness of a seasoned blues artist. He venerates the blues masters of the past and present but is eagerly making his own statement, inspired by the music they created. I'm watching him become a young, visionary blues giant. He has an amazing future ahead of him, and I'm proud that he's joined the Alligator family.\"\n\nKingfish is equally thrilled to have his debut album come out on Alligator, \"I never thought this would happen. I've been waiting to release my first record for such a long time. To have it come out on Alligator is a really great thing.\"\n\nBorn to a musical family near Clarksdale, Mississippi on January 19, 1999, Christone Ingram fell in love with music as a small child. There was always music playing around the house. His family sang (and continues to sing) at their family church. His mother, Princess Pride, is first cousin to country music legend Charley Pride. Christone starting hitting drums at age six and at nine he picked up the bass. Around this time his mother enrolled him in a program at the Delta Blues Museum. At age 11, he got his first guitar and quickly mastered it. The young prodigy soaked up music from Robert Johnson to Lightnin' Hopkins, from B.B. King to Muddy Waters, from Jimi Hendrix to Prince. Before long he could play like them all, but all the while he kept developing his own sound and style.\n\nChristone first stepped on stage at the age of 11 at Clarksdale's famous Ground Zero Club, playing behind one of his mentors, Mississippi blues icon Bill \"Howl-N-Madd\" Perry. Perry gifted the young musician with a new stage name, Kingfish. The young bluesman performed at the White House for Michelle Obama in 2014 as part of a delegation of young blues musicians from the Delta Blues Museum. By age 16 he was turning heads and winning awards, including the 2015 Rising Star Award, presented by The Rhythm & Blues Foundation.\n\nFunk music superstar Bootsy Collins began sharing Kingfish's YouTube videos \u2013 some with millions of views each \u2013 online, telling his followers \"this is how a child can influence others.\" Rapper The Game did the same. Christone's appeal beyond blues was immediate. He appeared on The Rachael Ray Show as well as The Steve Harvey Show. He was cast in season two of the Netflix program Luke Cage after the series lead producer saw one of his videos. Two of his cover songs appear on the show's soundtrack album, which immediately introduced him to a young audience who had never heard the blues before. Kingfish recently performed in an NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert with rap legend Rakim, who also appeared in Luke Cage.\n\nKingfish has shared stages with Buddy Guy, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Robert Randolph, Guitar Shorty, Eric Gales and many others. He has befriended rock stars from Nikki Sixx to Dave Grohl. Since graduating high school, Kingfish has continued his life on the road. He has performed at festivals around the country, including stops at the Chicago Blues Festival, the Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis, the Bonita Blues Festival in Florida, The Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland, on the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise, at Austin's Antone's and at San Francisco's famed Biscuits & Blues. He's performed in Europe multiple times, including appearances at the Moulin Blues Festival in the Netherlands and the Blues Heaven Festival in Denmark.\n\nIn addition to making music and touring the world, Kingfish donates his time and talent to two causes important to him. Through his work with various local Blues In The Schools programs, he visits with students around the country while he's on tour. \"It's important to teach kids about blues and music and give them another forum to express themselves.\" He's also an official ambassador for United By Music North America, a program helping people with developmental challenges, such as autism, to express themselves through music. \"Treat everybody right and anybody can do anything,\" says Kingfish.\n\nWith the release of KINGFISH and a major tour in the works (featuring dates with both Vampire Weekend and Buddy Guy), Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram is ready to blaze a trail with the blues torch that's been passed to him. With his eye-popping guitar playing and his reach-out-and-grab-you-by-the-collar vocals, Kingfish delivers each song with unmatched passion and precision. Steeped in the rich, vivid history of the blues, he's driven by his burning desire to create contemporary music that speaks to his generation and beyond. Kingfish is a real life 21st century bluesman who is inspired by the music of Robert Johnson, but dreams of one day collaborating with Kendrick Lamar and soul-funk bassist Thundercat. \"My core is blues,\" he says, \"but it's important for me to create a sound and style that is uniquely my own. I have a lot to say, so please stay tuned.\"", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.421188, 37.760565], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "OtherInfo": "Green Leaf Rustlers", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Chapel"}, {"Address": "456 Castro, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Hard", "ArtistBio": "Denim, sweet riffs, and leg kicks.\n\nDaniel Sowards\nCody Balaschak\nThomas Sweat\nBrady Gomillion", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8689754.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.435431, 37.761602], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Hard Rock, All Forms Of Tough Music, Hdm Hard Dance Music, Rock", "OtherInfo": "\"Hard\" w/ DJ Haute Toddy", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Q Bar"}, {"Address": "349 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Julius Papp", "ArtistBio": "Julius Papp is one whose dedication to music has propelled his career as a producer and DJ in the dance/club music scene. His dance music roots lie in Disco of the 70\u2019s and New Wave of the 80\u2019s. Presently living in San Francisco, he was born and raised in Montreal, Canada, and got tuned into dance music through the city\u2019s flourishing club scene and diverse radio broadcasts. He started collecting vinyl records in the mid 70\u2019s and took to the turntables in 1985, scoring his first major club gig two years later. Hearing the non-stop flow of music and observing the booth where the DJ seamlessly blended each selection were early influences for Julius. Later influences included reading about DJ residencies that were piloted by talented club music programmers that even today, influence the youngest of aspiring DJ\u2019s - legends like David Mancuso at The Loft & Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage in New York City to Frankie Knuckles at The Warehouse in Chicago and Tony Humphries\u2019 weekly at Zanzibar in New Jersey. Always inspired by the music listed in those articles, Julius would shop for those titles that would later become classics, worshipped by their discerning audiences. To this day, his goal is to keep expanding his foundation in music by being open-minded and eclectic in absorbing the music that truly touches him. That open-minded attitude is what Julius uses to fine-tune his musical palette, which gives him a dominant sound that exudes a deep and soulful perspective. That dominant sound is (Soulful) House Music \u2013 which to him, is about an uplifting positive message. People coming together in unity, with no barriers or restrictions, but rather, with tolerance and the spirit of music, unifying everyone on the dance-floor. That being said, he blends various musical styles together - including Soul, Latin, Afro, Disco, Jazz and Electronic sounds with such fluidity, that it is difficult at times to put a defining stamp on his sound. Contributing to that is his willingness to take a chance. He always tries to push the envelope by introducing music that deserves exposure, taking his audience on a musical journey with various mood and energy changes. Not content to limiting his ambitions in the DJ booth, Julius began producing music in 1994. The studio was another outlet for Julius\u2019 creative ideas to flow. His first release was a down-tempo project on the Acid Jazz tip. He also drew attention as part of the jazz and funk scene in San Francisco via the Mushroom Jazz parties alongside resident Mark Farina. As Julius\u2019 production catalogue grew, so did the amount of labels he released music on including \u2013 long tenured labels like King ST (NYC), Nervous Records (NYC), Large Music (Chicago) and OM (SF), to signings on Soulfuric Recordings (FL) and Kenny Dope\u2019s \u201cDope Wax\u201d (NYC) label, as well as Bob Sinclar\u2019s own Yellow Productions in Paris. He also ventured into the label arena with his own \u201cNeoDisco Music\u201d imprint. Named after the sound that continues to inspire him \u2013 the label offers him an alternate outlet to release his own productions. As a veteran in the club scene, Julius has refined a style of dance music that has taken him beyond the boundaries of San Francisco to global praise and recognition. Being nominated as \u201cMost Innovative Producer\u201d at the 2004 House Music Awards is a perfect example of that. Putting him in the company of other nominated producers like, Joey Negro, Osunlade, DJ Gregory, DJ Spinna and Ben Watt was an absolute honor for him. Upcoming releases for 2014 include a compilation/mix CD entitled \u201cA Long Hot Summer\u201d on King ST Recordings (NYC) as well as Julius\u2019 next full-length, artist-album, plus several singles. Recent production highlights include; Julius\u2019s collaboration with Lisa Shaw entitled \u201cWay Back,\u201d (DJ Smash Brooklyn Tech Remix), featured on the CBS crime drama, CSI: Miami; The song \u201cBelieve\u201d (with Deep Culture & Deborah Bond), included on Danny Krivit\u2019s 10 Year Anniversary, 718 Sessions, compilation/mix CD on Nervous Records. \u201cMusic Is The Key.\u201d Music Producer / DJ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6310748.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.88716, 37.33144], "Date": "Fri Sep 27 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-27", "Genre": "Genres: Deep House, Soulful House Music, Rnb-soul, R&b/soul, Electronic, Disco, Nu Disco, Downtempo", "OtherInfo": "Philadephia's Pete Moss makes his SPECTRUM debut on Friday, Sept 27th!

Hazey Eyes, is classically trained in a slew of instruments: from violin to piano to upright bass. But he was pushed onward by a musical family (his dad plays saxophone, clarinet and piano) eventually ending up being rated in the Top 5 players in his state.\n\nMusic began early for Hazey Eyes. As well as his work in the classical world, in high school he formed a heavy metal band. Though it\u2019s a far cry from the subtle, relaxing sound he makes now, the name Hazey Eyes is a subtle nod to his heavier background \u2013 it\u2019s taken from a lyric in the first chorus on Taking Back Sunday\u2019s debut album. Though there are subtle nods to his electronic background in the music, Hazey Eyes sits in a place of his own \u2013 one of comforting reflection, somewhere between the hours when night time begins and the day ends, all compliment with strings hinting at his orchestral background.\n\nLife can often throw curveballs, upending a once-pleasant situation and clouding it with darkness. In these times the music of Hazey Eyes is important: a way to feel less alone, to reconsider things, to even find a kind of happy solace in the sadness \u2013 all of which is important to move forward. Part of that comes from his heavy metal background, some of it comes from his dabbling with EDM.

George then went alone and in \u201995 bought us Smoker\u2019s Delight, a downbeat opus and the archetype 90\u2019s stoner album (not surprisingly, he was a one time high judge of the Cannibus Cup in Amsterdam). The effect of Smokers Delight was palpable as it is considered one of the main catalysts in the explosion of the chill out / down tempo genre today. Following Smokers, in 1999, Carboot Soul was delivered. A sublime languid success, it solidified George\u2019s reputation as the patriarch of this very popular genre. Regardless of the connotations now associated with chill out / ambient / down tempo, both Smokers and Carboot remain untainted zeitgeists, still viewed as soundscapes of good times past, music that a cross section of people enjoyed, often whilst languishing post clubbing. Zeitgeists of an era, these albums have sold over 150,000 copies and continue to, ten years and six years respectively after release. However, the Nightmares success story doesn\u2019t end there. Having been away for nearly four years (like a fine wine, the maturation of his work is crucial to its production process!), George honed a more polished production technique, and in doing so, in 2002 presented the addictive brew of pop, dancehall and old-soul that was Mind Elevation. Conquering the unknown, two hits on the album Know my Name and 70\u2019s/80\u2019s were embraced by the radio fraternity, infecting our airwaves that following summer with their sweet vocals, lush melodies and lolloping hip hop beats. Spring 2006 sees the drop of another one of George\u2019s musical gems, in the form of In A Space Outta Sound. It is a contemporary and varied album of many textures, tempos and tones, with harmonic inflections from cultures beyond these shores. Whilst this is an album deconstructing George\u2019s musical make up, by inviting you down a personal retrospective journey, In A Space\u2026 also unwittingly reflects the urban multi-cultural landscape we live in today. This mish-mash of geographically distinct sounds are heard whilst treading the streets of London, or Leeds where George is from, or any other big city in Britain. The society we live in is a racially heterogeneous one and this album is as diverse in its influences. Tellingly, this pastiche of styles has for many years also been reflected in his DJ-ing output (under his DJ name EASE). It is a sonic palette taken from each continent; each track presents a facet whether it be the infectious repetitive African percussion sounds of African Pirates, the recurring Caribbean reggae riddims as heard in Sweetest and Flip Ya Lid, the seduction of the Persian snake charmer\u2019s harpsichord entwined around Damn!, or Mo-town\u2019s soul-laid-bare in I Am You. Sometimes it is a blend of all of the above. Once again, Nightmare\u2019s trademark stamp is evident; rhythms infectious in their simplicity, blues infused time signatures overlaid by Quincy Jones-esque synth lines and the inherent fusion of relaxed dub, hallucinogenic hip hop and Balearic melodies. And there is another factor in George\u2019s formula, the intangible touch of glowing warmth that infects his music. As the Times newspaper once commented, \u201cGeorge Evelyn is one of those people who can bottle sunshine\u201d. This blissful quality is perhaps the x-factor in his success as a musician and it is one that George consciously and liberally mixes in. He takes from the essence of soul where emotion is its driving force. However, it is apparent that his emotions veer on the lighter side. As he says \u201cI want to share my positivity in life, in music.\u201d Like many fortunate music enthusiasts, his love of music was passed down from his parents. The Evelyn household was one often enveloped in the indignant funk of Curtis Mayfield and the smooth melody lines of Quincy Jones (where George\u2019s devotion began). The sweet, cloying lullabies of Sarah Vaughn were as often heard coming out of Mr. Evelyn\u2019s precious mahogany 78 players as Duke Ellington\u2019s lively compositions. Having come over from the West Indies as a young man, George\u2019s father also passed on to his children musical legacies of his birthplace, frequently playing staple classics of Soca, or Calypso as it\u2019s now called, found too at the local dancehall he frequented. However, like many, George\u2019s musical epiphany was most keenly felt through self-discovery. When only a pre-teen, he joined a local break dance crew, having immersed himself in the first wave of hip hop filtering through to Britain in the form of Rappers Delight and Buffalo Gals. It was here that he also found an early allegiance to soul where the sampled voices of the OJ\u2019s, Isley Brothers and James Brown were used over and over again as scratches on such records. However pre-dating his initiation into hip-hop came the pivotal moment when he discovered bass. It was inevitable that he would stumble upon local sound systems that mates\u2019 older brothers were involved in, but the effect the heavy, reverberating dub breaks that each collective tried to out do the other with, would be long lasting. In George\u2019s young mind, the louder those bass lines were, the bigger the impact it had on him hence his lifelong love for those heavy, rolling beats, integral to his sound. In fact, on his next tour, promoting In A Space\u2026 he will be performing as part of a sound system from a local Leeds collective. Naturally, it was also a great privilege to meet and collaborate with personal heroes like Scientist and De La Soul but his interests certainly don\u2019t end here, also citing rare groove, ska and 80\u2019s electro. A compliment to his taste, he has had not one, but two established music compilers (!K7 and Another Late Night) approach him for a personal selection of favourite songs for release, and within 3 years of each other. An endorsement of his popularity if ever there was one. George\u2019s success is enduring, and he has often been praised for his polished production work. Indeed with a state of the art studio, no one can fault the craft he has been honing for fifteen years. The subtle complexities and layers to his music is also what makes it so accessible. However this is certainly not the sole result of one man and a mixing desk. He works with a varied group of local musicians; a range of percussionists, classically trained keyboardists, guitarists etc., and evidence of this was found on his last tour to promote Mind Elevation, doing a string of dates with a thirteen piece band. Live musicianship is also quite apparent on In A Space\u2026. where much of the ideas came from impromptu studio \u2018jams\u2019. Producing the genuine article and constantly evolving and progressing is the prime motivation behind Nightmares\u2019 music. It is about taking the sounds of soul and reggae and hip-hop and more to a new plateaux. \u201cToday\u2019s music is inspired by what\u2019s gone on before and that is what fascinates me.

Now, San Francisco native, Gilbert Milam Jr., better known in the rap game simply as, Berner, has his eye set at being the next great artist to put on for the Bay. Starting off participating in rap battles at local coffee shops and open mic nights in the San Francisco area in 2007, Berner took things to the next level by turning his passion into his career. This story truly embodies every aspect of the phrase \u201cgrassroots.\u201d After creating his own label, Bern One Entertainment, Berner soon after released his debut album, \u201cTrack Money & Pack Money,\u201d a joint effort with fellow Bay Area rapper, Equipto. A true testament to his never-ending grind, Berner has released 10 independent albums, several of which have charted on Billboard\u2019s \u201cTop Rap Albums\u201d chart. In March 2012, Berner teamed up with Wiz Khalifa and signed to his Taylor Gang Records, joining the thriving roster which includes the likes of Chevy Woods, Juicy J, Lola Monroe, Courtney Noelle, Tuki Carter and more. \u201cUrban Farmer,\u201d Berner\u2019s first collection to be released on Taylor Gang Records, was released on October 2, 2012 and quickly took the Internet by storm. \u201cUrban Farmer\u201d captures the essence of Bay Area rap on tracks such as \u201cShut Up (feat. Chris Brown & Problem).\u201d With an impressive list of artist collaborations on his resume, ranging from rap legends Bun B and Wyclef to Chris Brown, Curren$y and even fellow Taylor Gang members Wiz Khalifa and Juicy J, Berner is showing no signs of slowing down in the near future. In fact, he\u2019s just getting started. Always one to master multiple entrepreneurial ventures, Berner isn\u2019t stopping at just music. He has two lifestyle/street clothing lines in the works with \u201cFreshKo\u201d and \u201cCookies,\u201d as well as his own line of hemp water, appropriately titled \u201cH20.\u201d All told, Berner is letting actions speak louder than words as he is on his way to becoming the future of the Bay Area rap scene.

year-old Atlanta native's classic mixtapes have put the streets and clubs in his clutches with his first single \"Tony Montana.\"\n\n\"I'm just coming out, but if you go anywhere in the south,\" says Future, \"I get that love and respect like I have a catalog of LPs under my belt. My mixtapes have had a definitive impact which is amazing and humbling at the same time. Now my music is spreading all over the world. I'm ready to deliver universal hits.\"\n\nWith his newly signed record deal courtesy of Epic Records and his connection to Atlanta's famed Dungeon Family, Future's career is finally off the launching pad. His first single's bubbling success comes from a mixture of the hypnotic track, Future's signature melodic flow, unforgettable chorus, and features international superstar Drake.\n\n\"When I was making 'Tony Montana,' it was so far fetched for me to get Drake on the record. They called me and said 'Drake wants to get on Tony.' We had a long conversation. I sent it to him and he sent it back the same night. 'Tony Montana' is the 'Scarface' movie on wax,\" explains Future.\n\nFuture's career started to take shape seven years ago when he hooked up with his cousin Rico Wade, trailblazing producer and founder of the pioneering collective of hip-hop legends, The Dungeon Family. \"I learned so much from him,\" Future says of Wade, producer of such seminal acts as OutKast, TLC, and Goodie Mob. \"He's so much of a leader. I picked up from his leadership. In order to be a leader, you have to start your own movement.\"\n\nFor months, Rico would help to cultivate Future's skills and within a year's time, Wade's Organized Noize production camp had a recording contract for the young gun through Dream Works Records, which was sold and eventually folded. The setback didn't discourage the upstart rapper.\n\nMeanwhile, Future started earning a living in the music business by staying behind the scenes writing hooks, verses, and even entire songs for artists ranging from unknowns to Grammy Award winners. \"Ludacris was one of the first artists to actually pay attention to one of my hooks. He heard a hook and I gave it to him. He used if for 'Blueberry Yum Yum' off of his Red Light District. Then I started helping Rico on various projects. I was getting money like that. I definitely have to say the Dungeon is where I studied songwriting,\" Future described. I was around writers like Sleepy Brown and Marquez Etheridge who wrote 'Waterfalls' for TLC and 'Blackberry Molasses' for Mista. My cousin had talented artists from all over the world in the Dungeon.\"\n\nFuture's fame as a songwriter finally broke through to the mainstream when he penned most of YC's Braggadocios BET Hip-Hop Award nominated blockbuster \"Racks featuring Future.\" The chorus, \"I got racks on racks on racks...\" became an instant smash in the clubs, on the radio, and was adored by everyone from fans to major artists such as Lil Wayne. \"Racks\" bubbled in the underground circuit of the south for six months before popping into mainstream this summer. In the meantime, Future started capitalizing on his buzz by putting together immaculate mixtapes such as Dirty Sprite. Songs such as \"Tony Montana\" would solidify him as the leader of the new wave of Atlanta bred superstars.\n\nAs determined as Future is now to become a music superstar, he almost got in the way of fulfilling his own dreams. \"When I was around 14 or 15, I got into the streets heavy and I got shot in my right hand. When I got shot, I stopped playing basketball and went harder hustling. My mother hated it. Whatever she wanted me to do, I did the opposite. From the time I was 17 until I was 24, I didn't talk to my mother because she didn't like what I was doing. I let the streets raise me.\" It wasn't until less than a year ago that he decided to give up hustling in the streets and solely focus on music. \"I didn't know sacrifice and patience,\" he admits. \"When I learned that, I started seeing rap pay off. I had to give the streets up to really make my way into music.\"\n\nAs much as he was allured by the streets, Future, as an adolescent was also attracted to school. \"Words always intrigued me,\" Future explained. \"When I went to school, I would read Shakespeare and just fell in love with how he mixed his words. I started playing around and writing poems, reading poems... then I started listening to Too Short... I learned all his songs.\"\n\nIn late 2010, Future went through a life change and made songs incessantly. \"I stayed in the studio everyday,\" he says. \"There are days I went to the studio broke, but I said I'm not going to miss one day in the studio. The day I miss could be the day God decided to bless me. It wasn't easy. By far the hardest thing I had to do in life was change, but it was by far the best move.\"\n\nEarlier this summer, Future inked a deal with L.A. Reid at Epic Records. The MC says it felt like destiny because Reid had also signed Organized Noize 20 years ago. Future already has his first two projects lined up: an EP this fall and a full length LP early next year.\n\n\"My EP is called Watch This and the meaning is basically, 'watch what's about to happen with my career,'\" he revealed. \"The full album is titled Pluto. Pluto is bridging the gap from where I started to now. I make 'astronaut music.' I make music on the highest level. When you listen to Pluto, you'll understand. I'm outta here! The music is more melodic on the album. It's feel good music straight from the soul.

In January 2016, his track \"Take Me Simple\" was featured on fellow Canadian Drake's OVO Sound Radio on Beats 1, and later that same year he appeared on -- and in the video for -- hip-hop star Travis Scott's single \"Beibs in the Trap.\" With his profile steadily increasing, he signed to XO, the Canadian record label founded by the Weeknd. His self-titled mixtape appeared in early 2017, and it was chock-full of his by-now-trademark silky vocals and slick beats.

Either way, it\u2019s safe to assume that Larry June, born Larry Hendricks, is the most colorful and unique rapper out right now spreading an authentic message of health and positivity.\n\nBorn April 8, 1991, in San Francisco to a musical family, Larry cites his cousin, a young rapper signed to Too Short, as the primary reason he went into music. June made his first beat around age 7 and 8 and released his first mixtape when he was 16 without any formal training, instead explaining that he \u201cjust got into rapping.\u201d The San Francisco native also calls Atlanta home, citing the two cities\u2019s variety of sounds, tempos, coasts and cultures as crucial to his music.\n\nEvident from his clever and musical ad libbing, the rapper gains most of his inspiration from Bootsy Collins, James Brown, and Michael Jackson. Much like these artists, June uses his voice as a musical agent, or, as he puts it, \u201cI look at ad libs as the instrument with the beat.\u201d He often freestyles adding to the witty charm obvious in his tracks and the fervent energy with a slowed-down groove element akin to the 70s soul music June listens to everyday\u2014complete with a photo of Lionel Richie on his refrigerator.\n\nInside his fridge, however, must be a plethora of oranges as the rapper is known for his iconic health advice and benefits of Vitamin C. The color is reminiscent of the 70s aesthetic and sound June seeks in his music and the health benefits of the fruit propagate his message of being good: \u201cYou got an orange, you\u2019re doing good.\u201d This playful element is reiterated in June\u2019s visual work and complementary material, such as the iOS game Orange Season accompanying his EP of the same name. June has plans to create a new, more impactful game in the future hinting at a possible collaboration.\n\nWhile June comes across as clever and humorous in his freestyles and symbolisms, his flow is nowhere near lighthearted territory. June displays an impressive command of his flows, never breaking his characteristic monotone delivery and easily spits out messages of life\u2019s complexities and nuances without missing a beat. After touring with Post Malone, who discovered him on Twitter with the internet buzzing around June\u2019s music, and tours with Asher Roth under his belt, the rapper secured a deal with Warner Bros. and is expected to release his new EP You\u2019re Doing Good.\n\nThe EP marks a departure from his previous EPs Larry and Orange Season with its experimental component in the production. \u201cI experimented with a lot of different sounds and wanted to try something with it. The flows didn\u2019t really change, it\u2019s just the beats that changed,\u201d says the rapper. The album came from a desire to create and maintain a positive outlook: \u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t feeling too good so I wanted to change to a positive perspective\u2014you\u2019re doing good because you are good,\u201d says June. He attributes the music to what his state of mind was at the time and this attempt to try every type of sound\u2014hence the experimental aspect of You\u2019re Doing Good.\n\nIndeed, You\u2019re Doing Good is heavily inspiring from the 80s influenced \u201cToo Live Crew\u201d to the more soul-inspired, bedroom jams \u201cThrow Sum\u201d and \u201cFall in Love\u201d. Each track is both stylistically and content-wise a bit different, but maintains that characteristic Larry June ethos. Of his top 3 tracks, June chooses \u201cSo Organic\u201d, \u201cToo Live Crew\u201d, and \u201cTell Me You Love Me\u201d for their distinct moods\u2014the \u201cbest moods\u201d for songs and some degree of relatability for everyone according to the rapper.\n\nJune continues the heat, health, and determination going for 2018\u2014completely deserving of the \u201cGood Job, Larry\u201d motivation.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8482626.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.201614, 37.750034], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: HipHop, R&B", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "3:30 AM", "Venue": "RingCentral Coliseum"}, {"Address": "7000 Coliseum Way, Oakland, CA 94621", "Artist": "Tyga", "ArtistBio": "2017 - Bitch I'm the Shit 2: http://apple.co/2woT70T\n2015 - The Gold Album: http://apple.co/2wKd9Wy\n2013 - Hotel California : http://apple.co/2vtdhty\n2012 - Careless World : http://apple.co/2wp3aTG", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8498978.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.201614, 37.750034], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: Hip-Hop", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "3:30 AM", "Venue": "RingCentral Coliseum"}, {"Address": "7000 Coliseum Way, Oakland, CA 94621", "Artist": "OMB Peezy", "ArtistBio": "Stream & Download http://flyt.it/OMBPeezyHumbleBeginnings", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9132118.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.201614, 37.750034], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: Rap, Hip Hop", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "3:30 AM", "Venue": "RingCentral Coliseum"}, {"Address": "7000 Coliseum Way, Oakland, CA 94621", "Artist": "Trippie Redd", "ArtistBio": "Stream & Download http://flyt.it/OMBPeezyHumbleBeginnings", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8872867.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.201614, 37.750034], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: HipHop, Hip-hop, Hip Hop", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "3:30 AM", "Venue": "RingCentral Coliseum"}, {"Address": "7000 Coliseum Way, Oakland, CA 94621", "Artist": "Yung Bans", "ArtistBio": "Yung Bans Official Facebook Page", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8716235.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.201614, 37.750034], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "3:30 AM", "Venue": "RingCentral Coliseum"}, {"Address": "7000 Coliseum Way, Oakland, CA 94621", "Artist": "TisaKorean", "ArtistBio": "Yung Bans Official Facebook Page", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.201614, 37.750034], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "3:30 AM", "Venue": "RingCentral Coliseum"}, {"Address": "Summt Rd., Los Gatos, CA", "Artist": "Charanpal", "ArtistBio": "www.charanpalmusic.com\nwww.charanpal.bandcamp.com", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9312157.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.981456, 37.1443121], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: kirtan, mantra, new age, world, indie", "OtherInfo": "Join us for two special events honoring the full and new moons of September.\n\nSet in the lush redwood forest of the Santa Cruz mountains, participants will experience a full line-up of classes and healings, including a light and delicious vegan lunch.\n\nSchedule:\n\n9-10am: Kundalini Tune-Up with Genia Avtar Daya\n\n10:30-11:45am: Crystal Illumination with Janna Bowman\n\n11:45-12:30: Mediterranean Lunch\n\n12:30-1pm: Metabolic Gong Bath\n\n1-2:30pm: Kundalini Master Class with Charanpal Kaur\n\n\nYou are encouraged to join for both the full and new moon events, yet a limited number of one-day passes will be made available.\n\nOpen to all levels, genders, and differently-abled.

All through school in rural Connecticut it was clear where he was going to be, working at the cutting edge of mathematics, as he took to the abstract shapes and numbers as a duck would take to proverbial water, until, that is, a band wearing grease paint, Cuban heels, questionable body hair and several pints of fake blood rolled into JL's particular little town: Kiss. A 12 year old JL was hooked by the devils fishing rod that was rock and/or roll and when his brother brought home a terrible guitar from college and left it when he went back, JL had the tools to begin his assault on the world.\n\nHe began fashioning songs using the simple chunking and melody of Jimmy Reed and sub-Rush lyrics about the challenging political world as seen by a 13-year old kid. Quick introductions to the lyrics of Bob Dylan, the power and message of The Who and the space-age ass funk of Parliament, shaped his musical balloon in new ways and JL, taking his John Nash brain and applying it to the one piece of equipment he had at his disposal, a useless dime store guitar, realized pretty quickly that he better maximize the algorithmic potential of the pathetic instrument by learning to pick each and every string independently and simultaneously with the dexterity of a perfect machine and the re-incarnated soul of a genius blind bluesman who strangely disappeared in the early 1930's. That blind genius would be the little known 20's & 30's virtuoso, Blind Blake, who JL heard by accident, floating in from the radio of his father while studying late one night on a mathematical problem involving fourier transformations. He rushed to the transistor just quickly enough to catch the name and his future was born. (He also finished the problem that night in case you wondered).\n\nFact #2: JL Stiles is the freakiest white fingerpicking guitarist in this great country right now.\n\nStiles carried on in his twin disciplines, learning Banach spaces and homology at college by day and wearing out his Blind Blake records at night, studying under the tutelage of the great Laszlo Fuchs, pioneer of abelian group theory, whilst writing hundreds of songs, each one getting gradually better than the last. Both strands were equal to him as he searched for the big picture in whatever way he could.\n\nBut something began to happen; as the songs got better and began to get attention, especially from the ladies, and JL realized that, Fuchs aside, a lot of academicians can be big dicks with fragile egos, he began to drift toward the more standard methods of soul searching for a young guy in late 20th century America: LSD, pot and anything other.\n\nHanging out in the blazing heat studying with Chinese Mathematicians, drifting into oblivion on opium and psychedelics, JL knew the music was more than a sideshow to a brilliant career in the outer reaches of theoretical math. It was, in fact, his calling, and one where he could teach the beauty of what is so perfect about math and blues, the abstract.\n\nImagine a wild-eyed, half-crazed math prodigy with the most dexterous fingers on earth, channeling the spirit of a mysterious blind blues genius who unexplainably vanished, and you are approaching where JL found himself at this juncture in his life.\n\nFact #3: The search for the fundamentals is the same in music as it is in math: The fingerpicking guitar opens up infinite possibilities\n\nBut what would he do with this burden? He wasn't just a singer-songwriter with a cute heartbreak song and a big white smile; he was the walking soul of mathematical fundamental principles driven into the ground by the spirit of the blues. Where could a young boy like this go? To the home of voodoo, New Orleans.\n\nIn an out of the coffee houses and clubs of New Orleans and Mississippi, JL spooked the audiences up and down and left and right, he cut a solo set of songs, just him and a guitar, that rang as clear and true as Blind Blake had 80 years earlier and he knew he had to get out there and spread the theory around.\n\nHe traveled to Mexico and Brazil, Amsterdam and Scandinavia, he lived in the woods for weeks at a time, writing new songs and trying to define a unifying mathematical and musical theory in homological algebra, he went to the brink and stared at the abyss and then he came back with songs in hand to deliver the message back to us dear souls who hadn't made the journey.\n\nHe found a spiritual home in san Francisco and immediately picked up on the musical community there. He played with Etta James in front of 6,000 in front of the courthouse in Riverside, he opened for the great Keb Mo, Leon Redbone, JJ Cale, John Hammond, he knew he was in the right place at the right time, and so, here he is.\n\nFact #4: What JL Stiles is writing now is the best he's ever written and is closer to the fundamental truth of bringing the past together with the future into a musical singularity than he's ever gotten.\n\nFact #5: JL Stiles believes he has come up with the algorithm for the pure heart of music.\n\nJL Stiles is a unique animal (as we have stated before), he believes that the soul of 1920's blues, c.400 BC Greek mathematicians and 21st century artists like Animal Collective (get ready for JL's incendiary cover of AC's \"No More Runnin\") can all be unified into his singular vision. Can he do it? With his head for numbers, I certainly wouldn't bet against him.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6820304.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26999, 37.790215], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Rock, Pop, Blues", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Eve's Waterfront"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Hot Club of Cowtown", "ArtistBio": "\u201cThis trio\u2019s stylistic genesis\u2013as well as title\u2013stems from the realization that the great heritage of strings (guitars and violins) originates mutually with the Manouche gypsies of France and the no-less virtuosic hillbilly pickers and fiddlers of Oklahoma and Texas\u2026.Together for over 15 years and a dozen albums, the threesome of high-heeled violinist Elana James, guitarist Whit Smith and bassist Jake Erwin showed from the beginning that jazz and country music could exist together on the same page, a highly commendable achievement if ever there was one.\u201d\n\n-Will Friedwald, Wall Street Journal (2014)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9401649.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: Hot Jazz, Western Swing, Folk, Roots, Blues, Gypsy Jazz, AMERICANA \\n\\nCovers Motown, Traditional and Southern Gospel Quartet, Ameripolitan, Dixieland, Jazz, Early Country", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse"}, {"Address": "City Center Drive, Rohnert Park, CA 94927", "Artist": "Sang Matiz", "ArtistBio": "Sang Matiz has been performing a collection of original and cover songs for 7 years, fusing energetic World and Afro-Brazilian/Peruvian beats with contemporary rhythms such as Pop, Jazz, and Funk.

The Brazilian American duo say that although their new track encompasses more of an electronic, synth-based feel, the lyrical subject matter was based on organic, human emotion.\n\n\u201cShow Me (that you want me) really struck me as an intense idea for a song,\u201d says vocalist da Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s scary how detached we humans have become.

Beginning as a local performer in Portland, Maine, James knew that he had to get his name heard in bigger cities. He left for San Francisco with nothing more than a guitar in hand to find work. Eventually, he joined forces with The Showdowns, a Bay Area-based group comprised of Matt Berg (drums), AJ Leighton (bass), John Paterson (keys), and Whitt Vicena (lead guitar). The unity amongst the band can be felt at every show through their synergized performances.\nSongs from their debut album, Lucky Breaks, and music from James\u2019 solo work have been played generously on SiriusXM Radio, radio stations throughout California, and placed in TV commercial promos. Chris James and the Showdowns\u2019 second album, Somewhere out in California, is authentic, dance-driven, heartfelt, and has been getting loads of attention from various media outlets. They have a packed tour schedule for the rest of the year, including full band and solo performances.\nDriving down the open road can get us lost in our thoughts when surrounded by the right views and accompanied by the right music. The title track off the album, \u201cSomewhere out in California\u201d begins with an acoustic guitar solo then joined by elegant piano keys. The intimate video is characterized by the natural beauty of California: the views, the ocean, and the forests. \u201cSomewhere out in California\u201d is the narration of a restless heart, reminiscing on all the possible \u201cwhat ifs\u201d of life. Every day we are forced to make hundreds of choices, big and small. After making a decision we sometimes have afterthoughts, imagining how life would be if different decisions were made and if different things were said. The lyric, \u201cDid you ever feel like we missed the bus\u201d is the metaphorical concern of making the wrong choices in the past and missing prime opportunities or possible new adventures. It is essential to remind ourselves to take risks: if not, we will regret all the possibilities that could\u2019ve been.\n\n--\"James' style of writing is hard to deny as it rings of times and life situations we can all relate to. It's nice to see an artist and band like the Showdowns hold true to Americana roots while still giving you a rock and roll kick in the ass!\" -Starita (Producer - Trevor Hall, Tribe Called Quest)\n\n--\"Chris is a singer-songwriter with an honest approach and style that really speaks to everyday people...\" - J.

As he unleashes his high-energy music to fans all over the world, Castro is inspired by the sounds he absorbed while coming of age on the rough and tumble side of San Jose, California. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, this was Castro\u2019s home turf\u2014his stomping ground. It was a place where the street-tough Mexican Americans and the counter-culture hippies came together to drink, smoke, laugh, party and listen to tunes\u2014the hippies with their blues and rock, the Mexicans with their soul music. Mixing the blues-rock he loved and the soul music he heard blasting out from the lowriders cruising the streets, along with the socially conscious message songs of the day, Tommy\u2019s own sound was born. He honed his guitar playing to a razor\u2019s edge on the city\u2019s competitive bar scene, where he learned how to capture an audience with his intensely passionate vocals, stellar musicianship and dynamic performances. Almost every major rock and soul act, from Ike & Tina Turner to Janis Joplin to Elvin Bishop to Taj Mahal, toured through the area, and Castro was at almost every show. He saw John Lee Hooker, Albert King and Buddy Guy & Junior Wells at the same local blues bar, JJ\u2019s, where he often jammed, dreaming of one day busting out.\n\nOver the course of his career, Tommy Castro\u2019s San Jose DNA has always inspired his music, whether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or the funkiest soul grooves. He and The Painkillers\u2014bassist Randy McDonald, keyboardist Michael Emerson and drummer Bowen Brown\u2014have played hundreds of shows to thousands of music lovers, always leaving his audiences screaming for more. All of his albums are filled with original blues, soul and West Coast rock, each song showing a slightly different side of Castro\u2019s multifaceted musical personality. Billboard says the band plays \u201cirresistible contemporary blues-rock\u201d with \u201cstreet-level grit and soul.\u201d\n\nOn his new album, Stompin\u2019 Ground, Tommy Castro opens windows into both his past and his always-evolving musical future. Produced by Castro and guitar wunderkind Kid Andersen and recorded at Andersen\u2019s soon-to-be legendary Greaseland Studio in San Jose, Stompin\u2019 Ground finds Castro letting loose on a set of 12 tracks featuring six originals and new versions of songs he learned and played as a young up-and-comer. He is simultaneously looking back with autobiographical originals and cover songs that inspired him, while forging a forward trail with modern lyrics atop blistering blues-rock. With The Painkillers firing on all cylinders behind him, Castro lays it all on the line from the opening notes of Nonchalant to the final, introspective Live Every Day. From the autobiographical My Old Neighborhood to the socially aware Enough Is Enough and Fear is The Enemy to versions of Elvin Bishop\u2019s Rock Bottom and Taj Majal\u2019s Further On Down The Road (two of his favorite songs from his earliest heroes), Stompin\u2019 Ground is pure musical pleasure. \u201cAs soon as we started cutting,\u201d Castro says, \u201cwe knew we were onto something.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the The Painkillers, Castro\u2019s friends Charlie Musselwhite (harp and vocals on Live Every Day), Mike Zito (guitar and vocals on Rock Bottom), Danielle Nicole (vocals on Soul Shake) and Los Lobos\u2019 David Hidalgo (guitar and vocals on Them Changes) add their talents to Stompin\u2019 Ground. \u201cI heard each one of my friends\u2019 contributions to these songs in my head as I was working on them. Happily, when I reached out and actually asked, everyone said yes.\u201d\n\nBorn in San Jose, California in 1955, Tommy Castro first picked up a guitar at age 10. He fell under the spell of Eric Clapton, Elvin Bishop, Taj Mahal, Mike Bloomfield and other blues-rockers. As he got older, Castro discovered the bedrock blues of Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Freddie King, Buddy Guy, Elmore James and the deep-rooted soul of singers like Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett and James Brown. By his teenage years, he was regularly heading to San Francisco to see his favorite artists at legendary venues like The Fillmore West and Winterland. He began playing in a variety of Bay Area blues and soul bands in his early 20s, making a name for himself as a hotter than hot live artist. In 1985 he became lead singer and guitarist for the locally popular blues band NiteCry, and began gigging regularly throughout Northern California.\n\nCastro joined Warner Brothers\u2019 artists The Dynatones in the late 1980s, gigging all over the country. He formed the first Tommy Castro Band in 1991, releasing his debut album in 1996 on Blind Pig. He hit the road hard, picking up new followers everywhere he went. In the mid-1990s The Tommy Castro Band served as the house band for three seasons on NBC Television\u2019s Comedy Showcase (airing right after Saturday Night Live), bringing him in front of millions of viewers every week. During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Castro released a series of critically acclaimed CDs for Blind Pig, Telarc and 33rd Street Records, as well as one on his own Heart And Soul label.\n\nCastro joined Alligator Records in 2009, releasing Hard Believer to massive acclaim. He won four of his six career Blues Music Awards including the coveted B.B. King Entertainer Of The Year Award (the very highest award a blues performer can receive). His song Hard Believer took first place in the blues category of the International Songwriting Competition. His next release, 2011\u2019s Tommy Castro Presents The Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue\u2013Live!, was a boisterous and searing collection of highlights from a series of live performances anchored by Castro and an all-star collection of blues giants, including Rick Estrin, Michael \u201cIron Man\u201d Burks and Joe Louis Walker. His relentless road-dog approach\u2014gig after gig, night after night\u2014has won him loyal, lifelong fans everywhere he plays. The Washington Post says Castro is \u201cphenomenal and funky\u201d with \u201csoulful vocals and inspired blues-rock guitar.\u201d\n\nCastro formed The Painkillers in 2012, creating a lean, mean four-piece lineup, capable of delivering soul-shaking, muscular music. The band released The Devil You Know in 2014 and Method To My Madness in 2015, with critics shouting praise and admirers cheering his every move. Castro had stripped his music down to its raw essence with the new, smaller band, sounding bigger than ever. On record and on stage, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers\u2019 road-hardened, seemingly telepathic musicianship bring an unmatched passion to Castro\u2019s blue-eyed California soul and hard-rocking, good-time songs. His hometown newspaper, The San Francisco Chronicle, describes Castro\u2019s music as, \u201cfunky Southern soul, big city blues and classic rock...silvery guitar licks that simultaneously sound familiar and fresh.\u201d\n\nWith months of tour dates across the U.S. and Europe, Tommy Castro & The Painkillers will be bringing the songs from their new album directly to their fans. No Depression says \u201cCastro plays gritty, string-bending blues like a runaway soul train...a glorious blend that rocks the soul and lifts the spirits.\u201d Blues Revue says simply, \u201cTommy Castro can do no wrong.\u201d With Stompin\u2019 Ground, he is clearly, once again, doing everything right.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8965655.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4576977, 38.2928073], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Rhythm, Soul, Rock", "OtherInfo": "Whether he\u2019s squeezing out the deepest blues or playing the funkiest soul grooves, legendary blues and soul giant Tommy Castro knows how to ignite a crowd.

That was back in 2002 and Chrigel only meant to form a studio project.\n\nSlania (2008)\n\nOf course all that is history by now and the so called \u201estudio project\u201c grew into a respected, well-known and active band. A relentless amount of touring and recording was all the band did in the past two years after having signed to Nuclear Blast Records. Their label debut \u201eSlania\u201c marked the first chart entry (Switzerland: #35, Germany: #72) and was followed by massive touring activities all around the globe throughout 2008.\n\nEvocation I: The Arcane Dominion (2009)\n\nIn 2009 the band fulfilled their dream of producing an all acoustic folk album without shredding guitars or growling vocals \u2013 for the first time in the bands history Hurdy Gurdy player Anna Murphy took over vocal duties. A masterpiece of folk music that fascinated fans and press alike. \u201eEvocation I: The Arcane Dominion\u201c of course also hit the charts hard \u2013 Switzerland: #20, Greece: #23, Germany: #60.\n\nEverything Remains\u2026 As It Never Was (2010 \u2013 2011)\n\n2010 & 2011 saw the band touring even more, but also dropping their most heavy and harsh album to date in February 2010: \u201cEverything Remains\u2026 As It Never Was\u201d \u2013 a contradictory title that, also in contradiction to its increased heaviness, hit the charts as high as never before: Switzerland: #8, Germany: #19, Austria: #22, Greece: #23, USA: #23 (Billdboard Heatseekers), Finland: #30.\n\nHelvetios (2012)\n\nEnter 2012, ELUVEITIE are set to lift the bar once again. With \u201cHelvetios\u201d the band created what is called the essence of their music by combining elements of all their efforts so far \u2013 taking them even further. From the raw and dark power of their early works to the anthemic tracks on \u201cSlania\u201d to the acoustic mysticism and beauty of \u201cEvocation\u201d to the heaviness and death metal brutality of \u201cEverything Remains\u2026\u201d. No doubt \u2013 \u201cHelvetios\u201d took ELUVEITIE not only one step but a whole lot of steps further!\n\nThe Early Years (2012-2013)\n\nOver the course of the band\u2019s 10th anniversary, it\u2019s now about time to scrutinize their early days closely, in which the foundation for today\u2019s success of the pioneers of their scene was laid.\n\nIt happened in winter of 2002/2003 that Chrigel started ELUVEITIE as a studio project to breathe life into his exceptional musical vision. The first self-financed EP \u201cV\u00ean\u201d was recorded in spring of 2003, was released in the same year \u2013 and completely sold out about six months later. The logical conclusion of the rhapsodical public reaction was quickly found: ELUVEITIE had to become a \u201creal\u201d combo with a consistent line-up for the purpose of being able to play live henceforth (the first concert in the band\u2019s history as support act of TRIMONIUM, MENHIR and SKYFORGER took place on the 5th of February 2004 in Winterthur, Switzerland). Quickly, ELUVEITIE were identified as an exceptionally gifted live band which enabled them to indulge in tour life extensively within the next months together with prestigious acts such as AMON AMARTH, FINNTROLL and KORPIKLAANI, before they returned to the studio in winter of 2005 to lay down their eagerly anticipated debut album. This very record named \u201cSpirit\u201d finally came out in 2006 and let the Swiss around maestro Glanzmann go down in the annals of metal as the founders and figureheads of the \u201cNew Wave Of Folk Metal\u201d. The rest is history\u2026\n\nNow ELUVEITIE have intensively recapitulated this exciting booster phase of their career. They\u2019ve re-recorded the entire rare \u201cV\u00ean\u201d EP in the line-up of 2012, by which a modern dimension was added to the legendary material, without the slightest loss of its historical splendour. Together with a re-mastered version of the full-length debut \u201cSpirit\u201d, this results in a profound retrospect that will send both long-time followers and nostalgia addicts as well as ELUVEITIE-newbies and those who have been chasing for these releases for years into rapture.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE.

An only child with no siblings, he struggled to fit in while growing up mostly raised by his Mother on Christian principles. Deep inside, Dallas felt no sense of Christ. He knew something was missing but was young in the faith and not fully developed in Jesus to know what to expect. The first 6 years of elementary, Dallas was in a Lutheran School. He was taken to Church and taught to upkeep the Christian values his Mom instilled as a child. Dallas was primarily raised by his Mother, Linda Francis. His father left when he was 5 years old due to his involvement with drugs and his abuse. At age 7, his Mother remarried finally presenting a male role model in his life that actually cared about him. However as soon as Dallas turned 14, he ran away from his mother and went to live with his Dad. Dallas\u2019 Dad never treated him like a Father should\u2026 bashing him for the way he dressed, calling him names, telling him he would never be anything and so forth. Dallas started believing the lies and walking around in hopelessness. He was fed up with his father and left, refusing to go back to his mother cause he wanted to prove to everybody he could make it on his own. He lived in his car on and off for around 3-4 months. After realizing he couldn't make it alone he finally called his mother when he was 17 from a payphone crying, saying \"HE HAD NO WHERE TO GO!\u201d\n\nAt age 21, his world began to shift and crumble. Growing up listening to rap music, he eventually learned to write his own. He worked at Blockbuster Movie Rental and one Friday night rapped in front of everybody in the store. A guy saw potential and asked him to be part of a group called \u201cPlatinum\u201d which consisted of 4 members who enjoyed money, girls, cars, fame, etc. He also began opening for clubs as well as other small venues, parks, bbqs, and award shows like the \u201cSammies\u201d (a local Grammys show in Sacramento). Since they were basically together all the time, he went to live with these 4 individuals. After a couple years, one of the group members went crazy and committed a murder which Dallas was accused of. Dallas felt confused, betrayed, full of anger, and rejected by God, even yelling at him.\n\nThe night before the murder, a still small voice told Dallas to call his Aunt and ask to come stay over a couple nights. While watching a movie with his cousin, he got a call from the Police Department saying his friend was murdered and he was needed for questioning. Dallas was traumatized. The Police investigation uncovered it was a Double Homicide. The woman that was killed was 8 months pregnant. This led a huge murder trial at the age of 22 for Dallas. At the time, Dallas was going to college and met a woman he used as a way of escape during the murder trial while staying with his aunt and uncle. When she accepted his marriage proposal, his aunt and uncle kicked him out leaving him feeling rejected. Dallas married for security so he'd have a place to stay. He grew to finally love this woman that claimed to \u201clove him.\u201d Six months later, she cheated on him with her ex-boyfriend. Dallas felt rejected and betrayed again but stayed with her for another 3 years. Knowing she cheated on him, every day Dallas lived with the shame and guilt that he wasn't good enough for anyone or anything. He finally got divorced and ended up living on his own again.\n\nThis is when Dallas found the only security he needed in Jesus Christ. Dallas went to live with his Mom yet again. He gave his life to Jesus and learned the principles of living a Christ centered life. This helped him realize he was living a lie from the enemy and God had a better plan for his life. He began developing a real relationship with Jesus. God brought one woman who knocked Dallas off his feet and treated him as he only dreamed of being treated. He trusted Gods direction and in 2009 ended up marrying Amy Marilyn Rodriguez who he's still married to this day. Dallas is on fire for God and teaching the message of the cross! He doesn't want others going down the path he did that may lead away from everlasting life through Jesus. Dallas writes music to encourage that we can make a difference in the world with no fear about rejection ever again. He once was rejected but now through Jesus Christ he has been adopted and accepted.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9103300.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.923243, 37.475317], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: Christian Rap, Christian, Gospel, Hip Hop, Rap", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Convergence House of Prayer"}, {"Address": "3098 E 10th St, Oakland, CA 94601", "Artist": "Saul Williams", "ArtistBio": "MartyrLoserKing has just tagged his screen name onto the White House lawn via remote drone.

And that\u2019s OK. But it takes courage to turn that anger into productive energy. The previous Sinkane album, 2017's Life and Livin' It, was released at a very crazy time: things like the Muslim ban, police shooting unarmed people of color, massive corruption in my native Sudan, fake news, Donald Trump, Brexit and so many other calamities all really forced me to think about my place in the world as a musician. I began to think about how I could use my music in a constructive way \u2014 not only to help myself but to help others who feel frustrated and powerless.\n\nI\u2019m not a newbie to hate: I\u2019m black, Muslim and even though I'm an American I'm often made to feel like a foreigner in my own country. And sometimes I do feel like a foreigner \u2014 in fact, I once made a whole album, 2012's Mars, about that feeling. I\u2019ve made a lot of music out of my life story but I\u2019ve always kept things vague enough that anyone listening to my music could relate to it on their own terms. And yet I have to admit that I never truly felt satisfied with that. I eventually realized that, in order to truly connect with other people, I first needed to connect with myself on a deeper level than before.\n\nThroughout the making of my new album I kept asking myself the same question: \u201cAs an immigrant to America, where do I belong?\u201d So, during the writing process, I worked mainly by myself so that I could ensure the most honest and personal answers to that question. I read books by Joseph Campbell, the late novelist/cultural theorist Daniel Quinn, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Pakistani novelist Mohsin Hamid, and the late African-American memoirist Philippe Wamba, hoping they\u2019d guide me to some kind of answer. Then, one day when I was wandering around the fertile desert of the internet, I stumbled upon an amazing word: d\u00e9pays\u00e9.\n\nD\u00e9pays\u00e9 is a French word that basically means \u201cto be removed from one\u2019s habitual surroundings.\u201d By extension, it means to be disoriented, homeless. That's a feeling I relate to very much in these times \u2014 and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one who feels this way. That word gave me clarity and made the journey inward that much more exciting.\n\nAfter I finished writing the album I brought the music to my band. Sinkane is an American band comprised of people from all over the world: I am Sudanese, guitarist Jonny Lam is Chinese, keyboardist Elenna Canlas is Filipina, drummer Chris St. Hilaire is Trinidadian, and bassist Michael \u201cIsh\u201d Montgomery is Black American. Our collective experience as children of the diaspora helped bring the music to life in the most honest way possible.\n\nSo here we are. D\u00e9pays\u00e9 is the story of an immigrant\u2019s journey of self-discovery in the Trump era. The music is loud and raw, and it's bursting with energy unlike anything I\u2019ve ever done before. It starts with a call to arms: \u201cEverybody,\u201d a rock & roll song in the spirit of Sly Stone and funky early-'70s Afro-rock bands like the Funkees and the Hygrades. Every day we wake up to another horror story about racism, and it\u2019s left many of us angry, confused and frustrated. But we can change the news for the better. We can show people that a multicolored world is a beautiful one. Celebrating our differences yields beauty in life. And that takes... everybody.\n\nThe second song of the album, the desert blues/dancehall-tinged \u201cEveryone,\u201d continues that line of thought to its logical conclusion: love is the key to helping us understand one another.\n\nThe psychedelic, groovy East African-inspired title track came to me in a dream: I dreamed I was walking the streets of Omdurman at night, a city along the Nile in my native Sudan, when I heard someone playing guitar and singing in Arabic. It turned out to be my father! He was sitting cross-legged on the ground, under a streetlight in front of my childhood home. His voice sounded hypnotic, raw and powerful as he sang: \u201cI am your life/And all of our lives/From within the city until our uprising/Our days have left us in the city and, with our imagination, we move forward.\u201d He sang that over and over, and I sing those same words in my song. This, along with the rest of D\u00e9pays\u00e9, has given me peace. I am no longer afraid of the unknown. I\u2019m no longer confused about my duality of my Sudanese and American identities. Now I accept it. And it's made me feel new.\n\n\u201cYa Sudan\u201d and \u201cThe Searching\u201d explore that duality. In \u201cYa Sudan\u201d I pay homage to my country of origin and in \u201cThe Searching\u201d I discuss what it means to move forward from that. Truly understanding one's duality means seeing beyond where you came from: let go of any definition that others put on you and then you can truly see the beauty of your life experience. \u201cStranger\u201d and \u201cBe Here Now\u201d address one of the most confusing aspects in the diaspora experience: religion. Lots of people have questions about their faith: What does this all mean? After all this work why do I still feel uncertain? What about all the bad people who are like me? And the good who are not? Those questions loom larger when you grow up with people different from you. I wanted to bring this up and let people like me know that they\u2019re not alone in questioning their faith. I also thought it would be funny to spitefully ask God to take accountability for his actions. The Arabic lyrics translate to \u201cOh God, aren\u2019t you our protector? Help me through these murky waters that seem part of your master plan.\u201d\n\nAs always, I'm inspired by Sly Stone, Fela Kuti, George Clinton and Bob Marley, as well as the beautiful music of east Africa (especially the Dur Dur Band from Somalia, Mulatu Astatkefrom Ethiopia, and Mohammed Wardi from Sudan). These people all spoke their minds confidently in front of a beat that made you dance. They welcomed every kind of person into their worlds with open arms. We live in an often terrible time but that shouldn\u2019t silence our desire to have a good time. To dance. To dream. To love. To be one with the world. To realize that we\u2019re not alone.\n\nI want Sudanese kids to see a person like them as a positive role model in the arts. I want Sudanese people, all over the world, to know that the world accepts us even when our own leaders, such as Omar El-Bashir or Donald Trump, do not. And ultimately, I want to make it clear that the world is a better place because of our differences. We\u2019re all strangers in this ever-stranger land of America. We are all the American Dream. D\u00e9pays\u00e9 is a place we can all know as home, with elements of all our homes. It's an act of imaginary cartography \u2014 on Mars, I called that place \u201cCaparundi,\u201d a place where Africa, North America, South America, Asia, and the Caribbean all meet in joyous harmony. The music is playing there all night long. Come in and dance and sing. And stay for the conversation.\n\nSincerely,\nAhmed Gallab", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8712679.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Funk, African, Reggae, soul, Psychedelic Rock, Jazz", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Cornerstone Craft Beer & Live Music"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Finish Ticket", "ArtistBio": "New EP When Night Becomes Day - Available Now \u25baiTunes http://smarturl.it/wnbditunes \u25baGoogle Play http://smarturl.it/wnbgGP \u25baSpotify http://smartu", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9173866.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Indie, Pop", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Slims"}, {"Address": "1131 N Lawrence Expy, Sunnyvale, CA 94038", "Artist": "Disturbio", "ArtistBio": "New EP When Night Becomes Day - Available Now \u25baiTunes http://smarturl.it/wnbditunes \u25baGoogle Play http://smarturl.it/wnbgGP \u25baSpotify http://smartu", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-121.996727, 37.3974], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Evolution Night Club"}, {"Address": "5104 Hopyard Rd, Pleasanton, CA 94588", "Artist": "Jess Hilarious", "ArtistBio": "Jess Hilarious is one of the freshest and most highly sought after faces in comedy.

Festival performances in front of 10,000+ people. They have also performed on the Today Show, X-Factor, Kelly and Michael and many other national television shows.\n\nMore amazing? They\u2019ve done this all on their own. No pop svengali overseeing their work. No studio musicians filling in the blanks. No Max Martin co-write. AJR may, in fact, be the first indie, DIY pop group from New York to make a splash.

No one could have foreseen that such a large audience would be interested in Finnish and English mythological texts.\n\nThe Folk Metal band rose up from the ashes of the former act Shaman and released their debut \u201dSprit Of The Forest\u201d in November 2003 via Napalm Records. Korpiklaani quickly prepared and recorded a new album called \u201dVoice Of Wilderness\u201d which came out in January 2005.\n\nTheir third album \u201dTales Along This Road\u201d was released the next year, followed by a successful promotion tour through Europe. The band kept on untiringly working on new songs, took part to the Wacken Open Air in 2006 and released both DVD and album \u201dTervaskanto\u201d in 2007.\n\nAfter a few sessions in studio came out the album \u201dKorven Kuningas\u201d in 2008. A music video to the song \u201dKeep On Gallopping\u201d was shot and broadcast on different channels.\n\nEven in 2009, the band didn\u2019t lazy and released their sixth album \u201dKarkelo\u201d.\n\nAfter some tours and appearances in festivals, the album \u201dUkon Wacka\u201d was published in February 2011 under the label Nuclear Blast.\n\nOne year and a half after the previous release \u201dUkon Wacka\u201d came the workaholics back from their refuge in the Finnish forests to bring us into a fascinating trip in the underworld. Alongside Tuomas Rounakari, successor of former fiddler Jaakko Lemmetty, and his impressive violinist skills, Korpiklaani proudly reveal\u201dManala\u201d their eighth studio album. The summarized story of Jonne gives a good of the concept behind the album: \u2018Manala\u2019 is the land of the dead, the Finnish underworld. This place has been mentionned several times in the finnish national epic \u2018Kalevala\u2019, which is the basis of many songs. In the 16th Kalavala\u2019s poem called \u2018V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen\u2019, a shamanic hero travels into the Manala in order to acquire knowledge from the dead. He meets there a girl named \u2018Tuonen tytti\u2019 or \u2018Tuonen piika\u2019 (maid of the dead), who will make him cross the river Tuoni. However, he does not find on the island Tuoni the spells he was looking for, and could only just escape. Now, the shaman curses every survivor who tries to enter the underworld.\n\nAs special gift for every fan outside their homeland, Korpiklaani released the original finnish version of \u201dManala\u201d with a bonus CD including the album in English in August 2012.\n\nThe band came back once again from the Finnish forests in May 2015 to deliver their new effort \u201dNoita\u201d. It is the first album featuring newcomer Sami Perttula and his accordion, after Juho Kauppinen left the band. As well as fiddler Tuomas Rounakari, Sami was very involved in folk arrangements. The album was once again recorded at the Petrax Studios with producer Aksu Hanttu.\n\nIn 2017, they released their debut DVD/Blu-Ray \u201cLive at Masters of Rock\u201d. This debut release captures everything they stand for; pure live energy, combined with their tales of Shamanic history and Finnish culture, to their world-renowned drinking habits which have been immortalised in a few songs dedicated to their favourite drinks.\n\nJonne was not just behind the editing of this release, he also took on the duties of mixing. As a knowledgable fan of music DVD\u2019s he spent a lot of time working with the mastering legend Svante Forsb\u00e4ck, who recently mastered the RAMMSTEIN DVD, ensuring that the perfect ambience and surround mix was achieved. Jonne\u2018s goal was to make the viewer feel like you are right there, live in the middle of the crowd.\n\n\u00bbLive at Masters of Rock\u00ab was filmed in 2016, capturing the band\u2019s performance at Masters of Rock Festival in Vizovice, Czech Republic. The performance was also a special event for another reason, achieving another of the band\u2019s visions; Tero Hyv\u00e4luoma (second fiddle) and Toni Perttula (second accordion and identical twin of Sami) both joined the Finnish masters live on stage, making it an unforgettable and unique folk show. Korpiklaani\u2019s vision of a bigger production is to have more folk musicians on stage with them. As Sami joked, having more folk musicians is a lot cheaper than pyro. He convinced his brother to play this show for just a few beers and Toni does not drink much\u2026\n\nJonne comments, \u201cThis is our first ever DVD release, which we are very proud of. It has no backing tracks, no choirs, no samples, and all of the mistakes are included. It is just us, Korpiklaani, pure live rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\u201d\n\nKorpiklaani have set the standard for entertaining any audience, no matter their age, musical preference or style.

The name Fee came by way of a bass player who thought Waybill looked like the King of Fiji, pictured on the cover of a National Geographic magazine, and began calling him \u201cFiji\u201d which eventually was shortened to Fee. Fee was raised in Scottsdale, Arizona where he sang and acted in elementary school assemblies which led to musical comedies in high school and then on to Arizona State University as a drama major. After moving to the mountains of northern Arizona to find his muse and living on brown rice and imagination he was enticed, without much difficulty, into being a roadie for the \u201cRed White and Blues Band\u201d on their way to San Francisco to make it big in the music business. Fee started singing background vocals and eventually the band combined with another Arizona band to become \u201cThe Tubes\u201d in 1973 with Fee as frontman and lead singer. The Tubes recorded ten LPs for A&M and Capitol Records from 1974 to 1985 and were headliners on their first tour, with 8 dancers, 7 band members, 6, 32\u201d onstage TV monitors, wild acts and and entourage of 35 including a pyrotechnic advisor, a video supervisor and two costume mistresses. In 1984, Fee recorded his first solo album \u201cRead My Lips\u201d and collaborated for the first time with Richard Marx. The pair has gone on to co-write over thirty songs for their own projects as well as for other artists. Fee left The Tubes after the 1985-86 tour to write and act and take a break from 14 years of touring. Moving to Los Angeles in 1986, Fee has since written lyrics for movie soundtracks as well as musical artists such as The Tubes, Richard Marx, Kenny Loggins, Toto, Steve Lukather, Pat Leonard, Vixen, Emerson Drive and others. Since 1991, Fee has won six BMI Performance Popularity Awards in recognition of his outstanding songwriting. His acting credits include Bill and Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventures, Ladies and Gentleman the Fabulous Stains, Private Eye, Bouncers, SCTV, MTV guest VJ appearances, along with three books on tape and various voice-overs on commercials. 1994 brought The Tubes back together with Fee for a long tour of Europe and a welcome reunion. The band has continued to play their unique brand of rock and roll, adding new songs to the mix of the already popular. \u201cDon\u2019t be Scared by These Hands\u201d was released in 1996, Fee\u2019s second solo CD, followed in 1997 by the eleventh Tubes release, \u201cGenius of America\u201d, the twelfth, Tubes World Tour 2001 and latest CD and DVD release in 2004, The Tubes Wild West Show. Fee continues to live in Los Angeles. He enjoys scuba diving, water skiing and hiking with his dog. He is also an avid polo player and owns four horses. He supports animal rights causes and participates in a number of celebrity charity events eachyear including Richard Marxs\u2019 CF charity show, Alice Coopers\u2019 Solid Rock Foundation Golf Tournament and ESPNs\u2019 annual charity golf tournament. His interests also include Mayan ruins, history and art of the American West and Bikram\u2019s hatha yoga. Fee is also a member (aka \u201cBarnie\u201d) of The Barn Theatre in Augusta MI, the oldest for profit summer stock theatre in the US, and has reprised his role as Frank N Furter in The Rocky Horror Show six times. Since Fee\u2019s first tenure at the Barn Theatre in 1999 he has revived the theatrical presentation of The Tubes show including props and more than ten costume and character changes in the current show. After a busy summer schedule Fee is thrilled to take a break and reprise his role, for the 6th time, as Frank Furter at the Barn. Fee says, \u201cIt\u2019s like a vacation for me to come back to The Barn to do Rocky again, it\u2019s so much fun and I feel so welcome.

He\u2019s a musical universe unto himself, expanding at a nearly immeasurable rate, ever more hard to define \u2014 as a mind-blowing guitarist, a dazzling songwriter and engagingly soulful singer. With his debut album Blak And Blu he has just become the first artist ever recognized by the Recording Academy with Grammy Award nominations in both the rock and R&B categories for the same album in the same year, winning the latter: Best Traditional R&B Performance\u201d - \u201cPlease Come Home\u201d (from the album Blak And Blu). And the day after claiming those honors he provided one of the highlights of the highlights-filled \u201cThe Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to the Beatles,\u201d with sparks flying as he dueled with Joe Walsh on an incendiary \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps,\u201d Dave Grohl behind them pounding the drums. But that barely scratches the surface. The album\u2019s a rocket ride from the Mississippi Delta of a century ago to multiple points still out beyond the horizon. Rock and R&B sure, but blues, soul, pop, psychedelia, punk and hip-hop are also in Clark\u2019s expansive musical embrace and insatiable hunger for inspiration, which he\u2019s internalized into music all his own. And his two acoustic blues performances on the soundtrack album for the acclaimed movie 12 Years a Slave show the distinct talent and personality he brings to his music. That, in turn, has been inspirational to others \u2014 including some who inspired him. Just ask Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Jay-Z, Jimmy Page, Alicia Keys, the Roots, Buddy guy, Dave Matthews, Roger Waters, Keith Urban, Sheryl Crow, Jeff Beck, among the many who hailed his arrival as a major talent and cherished chances to perform with him. It\u2019s no accident that he was invited to make more \u201cspecial guest\u201d appearances on the Stones\u2019 recent 50th anniversary tour than any other artist, including the concluding Hyde Park blowout in which he and band also were the opening act. Or ask President Barak Obama himself, who seeing Clark command the stage of the PBS White House concert honoring the blues \u2014 with Jagger, Beck, B.B. King and Buddy Guy among the veterans performing \u2014 declared of the young man, \u201cHe\u2019s the future.\u201d Rolling Stone dubbed Clark \u201cThe King of the Summer Festivals\u201d as he captivated audiences from Coachella to Glastonbury, Lollapalooza to the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, from Metallica\u2019s Orion Festival to Jay-Z\u2019s Made in America, and of course his hometown Austin City Limits Festival, where he his band set a daytime attendance record. He\u2019s dominated late night and daytime TV with multiple appearances on Leno, Letterman, Kimmel, Conan, Fallon, Arsenio Hall, Queen Latifah, Today, CBS This Morning and so on. Guitar Player magazine made him the first emerging artist to grace its cover in more than 15 years. Rolling Stone proclaimed him no less than \u201cThe Chosen One.\u201d It\u2019s a lot to live up to, but through it all his musical ambition and reach continue to grow. New songs he\u2019s previewed to delighted audiences show him exploring ever further combinations of sounds and styles, all with his distinct stamp. A man of few words, he\u2019s quietly grateful that the music he makes his way has connected with so many. \u201cTo think a weird idea I noodled on at the house has gone to something 40,000 people might hear at a festival is an indescribable feeling,\u201d he told Esquire recently. \u201cAs cool as I might try to be, I think, \u2018Oh my God, this is real!\u2019\u201d \"Come Together\" - the new single available now!

En 1975 decidieron juntarse para tocar distintos temas de grupos a los que admiraban, entre ellos The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, The Police, entre otros. Inicialmente, se hac\u00edan llamar The Spies of the Green Hat, pero pronto el nombre se abrevi\u00f3 a Green Hat y, finalmente, se adapt\u00f3 al espa\u00f1ol como Sombrero Verde, ya que la banda deseaba tocar rock en su propio idioma, siendo de los primeros grupos en aventurarse a componer sus propias canciones aun cuando el rock en espa\u00f1ol no era una tendencia. En 1981 publicaron su primer disco, Sombrero Verde, con el sello Ariola; los sencillos fueron \"Vampiro\", \"Profesor\", \"Long time\" y \"Despi\u00e9rtate\". En 1983 lanzaron A Tiempo de Rock; los sencillos del \u00e1lbum ser\u00edan \"Laura\", \"Hechos nada m\u00e1s\" y \"Me voy al mar\". Con esta producci\u00f3n el grupo logr\u00f3 escaso \u00e9xito. En 1984, Abraham Calleros, baterista del grupo, decide dejar la banda para continuar su carrera musical en Estados Unidos. El grupo decide poner un anuncio en el peri\u00f3dico solicitando un nuevo integrante, gracias a esto encuentran al joven baterista de origen cubano-colombiano nacido en Miami, Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, quien a partir de ese momento ser\u00eda pieza clave de la historia del grupo. La vida de Sombrero Verde continu\u00f3 hasta 1986, cuando el guitarrista Gustavo Orozco decide tambi\u00e9n abandonar la agrupaci\u00f3n concentrarse en sus estudios acad\u00e9micos. Al quedar de nuevo el grupo como cuarteto, Fher decide cerrar el libro de Sombrero Verde y formar una nueva banda que fusionara el rock, pop y los ritmos latinos. En esa \u00e9poca, comenz\u00f3 en M\u00e9xico el movimiento denominado \"Rock en tu idioma\", una estrategia comercial de algunas compa\u00f1\u00edas discogr\u00e1ficas encaminada a llamar la atenci\u00f3n de los j\u00f3venes para desarrollar m\u00fasica rock en espa\u00f1ol. La tendencia, importada de Argentina y Espa\u00f1a, estaba avalada por el trabajo pionero de grupos como Soda Stereo, Enanitos Verdes, Mecano, Nacha Pop, La Uni\u00f3n, Radio Futura, Hombres G y Zas (La banda de Miguel Mateos); como consecuencia de ello, aparecieron varias bandas mexicanas formadas por j\u00f3venes con influencias musicales de grupos norteamericanos y europeos. Surgieron as\u00ed las bandas l\u00edderes del movimiento en M\u00e9xico: Caifanes, Maldita Vecindad, Caf\u00e9 Tacvba y, entre ellas, Man\u00e1, quienes lograr\u00edan \u00e9xito no solo a nivel local sino tambi\u00e9n internacionalmente. Man\u00e1 En medio de este naciente movimiento, la banda adopt\u00f3 el nombre que le dar\u00eda proyecci\u00f3n internacional: \u00abMan\u00e1\u00bb, que fue elegido por el significado que tiene la palabra en polinesio: \u00abenerg\u00eda positiva\u00bb. La alineaci\u00f3n qued\u00f3 conformada por Fher Olvera como vocalista, los hermanos Ulises y Ju\u00e1n Diego Calleros, en guitarra y bajo respectivamente, y Alex Gonz\u00e1lez en la bater\u00eda. En 1987, el grupo firm\u00f3 con la discogr\u00e1fica Polygram y public\u00f3 Man\u00e1, disco que afianzar\u00eda el movimiento Rock en tu idioma. De este trabajo se desprendieron los sencillos: \u201cRobot\u201d, \u201cMentirosa\u201d, \u201cMueve tus caderas\u201d y \u201cQueremos paz\u201d. Con esta producci\u00f3n el grupo tuvo escaso \u00e9xito, y no dej\u00f3 del todo satisfechos a los integrantes; diversos roces con la disquera por el deseo de mantener la esencia e identidad del grupo, llevaron a Man\u00e1 a pedir su carta de retiro de Polygram. Falta Amor Con un futuro incierto el grupo trabaja en nuevos demos y busca una nueva compa\u00f1\u00eda discogr\u00e1fica, logrando firmar con Warner Music M\u00e9xico. Tras la mala experiencia del primer disco, Fher y Alex estaban concientes de los riesgos que implica ponerse en las manos de un productor que no entend\u00eda el concepto del grupo ni su propuesta art\u00edstica, por lo que optaron por iniciarse en un camino del cual no se han apartado desde entonces: asumir ellos la producci\u00f3n de todos sus discos. Con esa idea en mente graban el \u00e1lbum Falta Amor (1989), que no obtiene \u00e9xito sino hasta un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s de su lanzamiento gracias al sencillo \u201cRayando el sol\u201d, el cual se convierte en el primer gran \u00e9xito para Man\u00e1; los sencillos \u201cPerdido en un barco\u201d, \u201cEstoy agotado\u201d y \u201cBusc\u00e1ndola\u201d llegan tambi\u00e9n al gusto de la gente. El grupo realiza 112 presentaciones en M\u00e9xico y su primer concierto multitudinario fuera de las fronteras de su pa\u00eds, en el Coliseo General Rumi\u00f1ahui de Quito, Ecuador. Fue gracias a esta presentaci\u00f3n que el grupo se dio cuenta del potencial que la banda pod\u00eda tener a nivel internacional. \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os? En 1991 Man\u00e1 enfrenta el primer cambio en su alineaci\u00f3n con la salida de Ulises Calleros, quien desde entonces se dedica a representar al grupo. Ello signific\u00f3 la llegada de dos nuevos miembros: el tecladista Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez y el guitarrista C\u00e9sar \u201cEl Vampiro\u201d L\u00f3pez. Con esa nueva formaci\u00f3n graban en Los \u00c1ngeles en el a\u00f1o 1992 \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os?, \u00e1lbum que constituye un aut\u00e9ntico parteaguas en la historia del grupo y en la del rock en espa\u00f1ol, manteni\u00e9ndose durante 97 semanas en la lista Billboard de los discos m\u00e1s vendidos de Latinoam\u00e9rica. Ocho sencillos de esta producci\u00f3n encabezaron las listas de popularidad en toda la Am\u00e9rica hispanoparlante y se han convertido en temas cl\u00e1sicos de su repertorio: \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d, \u201c\u00bfD\u00f3nde jugar\u00e1n los ni\u00f1os?\u201d, \u201cDe pies a cabeza\u201d, \u201cComo te deseo\u201d, \u201cOye mi amor\u201d, \u201cC\u00f3mo diablos\u201d, \u201cTe llor\u00e9 un r\u00edo\u201d y \u201cMe vale\u201d. La globalizaci\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 inicia en 1993, con una maquinaria promocional de primer nivel y una serie de 268 conciertos en m\u00e1s de 17 pa\u00edses. La gira fue un \u00e9xito y posicion\u00f3 a la banda entre la comunidad latina de Estados Unidos y en mercados como Chile, Ecuador, Per\u00fa, Bolivia, Venezuela y Argentina. Argentina y Espa\u00f1a, dos territorios hist\u00f3ricamente dif\u00edciles de alcanzar para artistas latinos no nativos, fueron tambi\u00e9n conquistados por el fen\u00f3meno de Man\u00e1 gracias a que el tema \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d alcanz\u00f3 el primer lugar en las listas de popularidad de ambos pa\u00edses, lo cual no hab\u00eda sucedido en 26 a\u00f1os. Este mismo tema se hace merecedor al premio MTV Latino Video Music Award como mejor video del a\u00f1o. En Abril de 1994 y por diferencias art\u00edsticas y profesionales, Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez y C\u00e9sar \u201cEl Vampiro\u201d L\u00f3pez dejan Man\u00e1 a la mitad de la gira. Por un segundo, el futuro de la banda y su tour estuvo en duda, pero pronto demostraron que la formula de la agrupaci\u00f3n y su esencia segu\u00eda intacta. Para acabar la gira contrataron a los m\u00fasicos Ju\u00e1n Carlos Toribio como apoyo en teclados, Gustavo Orozco en guitarra y Sheila R\u00edos en coros. Man\u00e1 en Vivo Con su nuevo y bien merecido estatus en la escena del rock pop latino internacional, el tr\u00edo compuesto por Fher, Alex y Ju\u00e1n lanzaron el disco Man\u00e1 en Vivo (1994). La idea de lanzar un disco de sus conciertos surge como un medio para capturar la energ\u00eda y revivir cada momento, cada gota de adrenalina y sudor que forman parte de la magia de las presentaciones de Mana. El disco fue grabado entre Agosto y Septiembre de 1994, durante las presentaciones del grupo en el Universal Amphitheatre de Los \u00c1ngeles, la Sports Arena en San Diego, el Aragon Theatre en Chicago, el Teatro Gran Rex en Buenos Aires, el Estadio de Chile en Santiago y la Sala Est\u00e1ndar en Barcelona. Una vez m\u00e1s, la revista Billboard los galardon\u00f3 con el premio al mejor \u00c1lbum Rock/Pop del A\u00f1o. Cuando Los \u00c1ngeles Lloran Deseosos de regresar a su formaci\u00f3n original como cuarteto, Man\u00e1 tiene el tercer y \u00faltimo cambio en su alineaci\u00f3n. La banda audiciona a m\u00e1s de 80 guitarristas de M\u00e9xico, Argentina, Chile y Estados Unidos, hasta que finalmente en Aguascalientes, M\u00e9xico, encuentran al talento que buscaban en Sergio Vall\u00edn, cuya sorprendente sensibilidad, t\u00e9cnica y versatilidad vienen a darle un lustre distinto al sonido de las guitarras en las producciones de la banda. Con esa nueva formaci\u00f3n y con demos hechos en Guadalajara y Puerto Vallarta, graban y editan el disco Cuando los \u00c1ngeles Lloran (1995) entre Los \u00c1ngeles y el puerto jalisciense. Esta producci\u00f3n, lanzada tres a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su exitoso \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os? se distingue por una notable evoluci\u00f3n en la l\u00edrica y el sonido del grupo. Los sencillos \u201cD\u00e9jame entrar\u201d, \u201cNo ha parado de llover\u201d y \u201cHundido en un rinc\u00f3n\u201d no solo representaron un rotundo \u00e9xito en la radio, sino que los videos correspondientes tuvieron una gran rotaci\u00f3n en los canales de m\u00fasica y ganaron diversos premios por su calidad. El disco les permiti\u00f3 una primera nominaci\u00f3n al premio Grammy Americano, el m\u00e1s importante en la industria discogr\u00e1fica. Con el estandarte de un nuevo disco el grupo inicia su nueva gira el 12 de mayo de 1995, con un total de 52 conciertos realizados en 13 pa\u00edses, esto en un per\u00edodo de menos de cinco meses, lo cual mostr\u00f3 el fen\u00f3meno que para ese momento ya significaba Man\u00e1. Durante su visita a Espa\u00f1a en ese mismo a\u00f1o, el grupo se present\u00f3 en la plaza de Las Ventas junto a Revolver y La Uni\u00f3n, donde el p\u00fablico recibi\u00f3 a la banda con los brazos abiertos. La gira Cu\u00e1ndo Los \u00c1ngeles Lloran signific\u00f3 al grupo presentaciones con sold out completos en cada plaza que visitaban. Otros impresionantes logros fueron la inclusi\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 en el festival de Jazz de Montreaux y la conferencia Midem, que tuvieron lugar en Suiza y Francia, respectivamente, una proeza nunca antes alcanzada. Tambi\u00e9n participan con un tema en la pel\u00edcula My Family, a petici\u00f3n del prestigiado director Francis Ford Coppola. Man\u00e1 siempre ha expresado su inter\u00e9s en los problemas que el planeta est\u00e1 enfrentando en materia de ecolog\u00eda, por lo que en Septiembre de 1995 crearon la Fundaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica Selva Negra, con el objetivo de crear conciencia sobre el tema. (www.selvanegra.org.mx) A mediados de Abril de 1996, el grupo continu\u00f3 una extensa y esperada gira por toda la Rep\u00fablica Mexicana. Durante la segunda mitad de 1996 la banda se aventur\u00f3 en una gira de 17 conciertos con localidades agotadas en Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, Santa Barbara, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, New Orle\u00e1ns, Sacramento, Miami, San Jose, Phoenix, San Bernardino, Tucson, Anaheim y las Vegas. Dicho tour les vali\u00f3 importantes art\u00edculos en prestigiosas revistas como Rolling Stone, Time, Details, People Magazine, Newsweek y Pollstar. El 7 de Septiembre de 1996 la banda se presenta dos noches con localidades agotadas en el James Knight Center de Miami, logro nunca antes alcanzado por una banda de rock pop latina. La producci\u00f3n le vali\u00f3 al grupo el premio Billboard al Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock/Pop Latino, lo cual fijo un record de 6 premios Billboard recibidos en un per\u00edodo de 3 a\u00f1os. Despu\u00e9s de sus presentaciones en Estados Unidos la banda regresa a M\u00e9xico, donde dan 2 exitosos conciertos en la Plaza de Toros de su natal Guadalajara. Durante su estad\u00eda en dicha ciudad, la banda dio una conferencia de prensa para anunciar el lanzamiento de su website; mientras la conferencia ten\u00eda lugar el sitio recibi\u00f3 6000 entradas, una cifra sorprendente tomando en cuenta la \u00e9poca. En Marzo de 1997 la reconocida revista americana especializada en bateristas y la industria de este instrumento, Modern Drummer, public\u00f3 un art\u00edculo sobre Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, en la cual se\u00f1ala a Man\u00e1 como todo un suceso dentro del rock pop latino en Estados Unidos, a la par de reconocer a Alex como uno de los mejores bateristas a nivel mundial dentro del g\u00e9nero. 11 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, en Marzo de 2008 Alex aparece de nuevo en la revista, pero esta vez en una extensa entrevista. Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos Tras una favorable experiencia de su anterior grabaci\u00f3n en Puerto Vallarta, sitio important\u00edsimo en el atlas creativo de Man\u00e1, el grupo decide regresar para hacer los demos y la grabaci\u00f3n de su pr\u00f3xima producci\u00f3n. As\u00ed, con la ambici\u00f3n de crear m\u00fasica en un ambiente donde el agua, elemento vital como pocos, tuviera una presencia contundente, Man\u00e1 renta una hermosa casa con vista a Bah\u00eda de Banderas, en Conchas Chinas, y graban el disco Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos en 1997. Incontables atardeceres frente al oc\u00e9ano fueron el marco id\u00f3neo para concebir Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, \u00e1lbum producido tambi\u00e9n por Fher y Alex, en colaboraci\u00f3n con Benny Faccone. El resultado fue una energ\u00e9tica mezcla de rock, pop y ritmos latinos que van desde el bosanova hasta el flamenco, pasando por la cadencia caribe\u00f1a del reggae. Importantes sencillos como \u201cEn el Muelle de San Bl\u00e1s\u201d, \u201cHechicera\u201d, \u201cClavado en un bar\u201d y \u201cComo dueles en los labios\u201d se desprenden de esta producci\u00f3n. El disco sali\u00f3 al mercado en Octubre de 1997 y fue lanzado simult\u00e1neamente en 36 pa\u00edses; debut\u00f3 en primer lugar en el Billboard Hot Latin 50 Chart. La producci\u00f3n son\u00f3 fuerte tambi\u00e9n en la Uni\u00f3n Americana y Man\u00e1 se convirti\u00f3 en la primera banda de rock en espa\u00f1ol que se present\u00f3 en El Show de Kathie Lee & Regis, emisi\u00f3n l\u00edder de audiencia en la televisi\u00f3n estadounidense. El 30 de Enero de 1998 la banda inici\u00f3 su gira m\u00e1s ambiciosa, Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos World Tour en Chile, para posteriormente visitar Uruguay y M\u00e9xico. Tras una pausa de 4 semanas debido a que el baterista, Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, fue diagnosticado con hepatitis A, el grupo reanud\u00f3 la gira por su natal M\u00e9xico, donde ofrecieron 44 conciertos. Entre las presentaciones que destacan en la gira Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos Tour 98 se encuentran las de Bolivia, Colombia, Per\u00fa, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Chile, Puerto Rico, Honduras, y El Salvador. Otras de las presentaciones m\u00e1s importantes son los conciertos en el Auditorio Nacional, recinto en el que Man\u00e1 rompi\u00f3 r\u00e9cord, pues fue la primera ocasi\u00f3n en que una banda de este g\u00e9nero se presenta siete veces consecutivas sobre este escenario. De vital importancia para la carrera de Man\u00e1 fue ser la primera banda de rock en espa\u00f1ol firmada por la agencia Creative Artist Agency (CAA), con ello Man\u00e1 se un\u00eda a la importante lista de representados que inclu\u00eda a Bon Jovi, AC/DC, Alanis Morissette, Eric Clapton, Madonna, Depeche Mode, Santana, Bob Dylan, George Michael, entre otros. Su primer gira de la mano con CAA inici\u00f3 el 21 de agosto de 1998 en Los \u00c1ngeles, CA y cubri\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 30 ciudades con un total de 36 shows en arenas y anfiteatros, la mayor\u00eda de ellas con llenos totales. Importantes presentaciones tuvieron lugar en el Universal Amphitheatre de Los \u00c1ngeles y en el Rosemont Horizon Arena, donde rompen record al ser el primer grupo de rock pop latino en agotar localidades. Este tour fue el m\u00e1s grande realizado por un grupo de rock pop latino en Estados Unidos. La banda es nominada por sexta vez consecutiva a los premios que otorga la revista Billboard por Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, dentro del rubro Mejor \u00c1lbum Pop Rock del A\u00f1o, llev\u00e1ndose el cotizado premio. En diciembre de 1998, Man\u00e1 fue nominado por segunda vez a los Premios Grammy Americanos en la categor\u00eda Mejor \u00c1lbum Latino de Rock/Alternativo por Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, premio al que se hicieron merecedores el 24 de febrero de 1999. Este es el primer Grammy otorgado a una banda de rock pop mexicana. Tambi\u00e9n en diciembre de 1998, Fher recibe una invitaci\u00f3n por parte de Carlos Santana para participar en su nuevo material discogr\u00e1fico. Fher compone \u00a8Coraz\u00f3n espinado\u00a8, tema con el cual se abren fronteras para la m\u00fasica latina, tras colocarse este sencillo en los primeros lugares de pa\u00edses europeos, asi\u00e1ticos, y americanos. La grabaci\u00f3n se realiz\u00f3 en las ciudades de Los \u00c1ngeles y San Francisco CA, en donde naci\u00f3 una gran amistad entre ambos m\u00fasicos. Como resultado de esta colaboraci\u00f3n, Alex y Fher reciben el premio Grammy como productores y escritores de dicha canci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de realizar junto a Santana una gira por Estados Unidos y M\u00e9xico. El grupo comparti\u00f3 arenas, auditorios y estadios de la Uni\u00f3n Americana con Carlos Santana, en una extensa gira que dar\u00eda comienzo el 29 de julio de 1999 en la ciudad de Houston TX, seguida de varias presentaciones por diferentes ciudades de ese estado, para continuar en Phoenix, Tucson, San Diego, Anaheim, Mountain View, Concord, Sacramento, Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Boise, y Denver. Abrir\u00eda los conciertos el grupo Ozomatli, seguidos de Man\u00e1 y Carlos Santana alternando el orden de estos en cada una de sus presentaciones. Conciertos hist\u00f3ricos se llevan a cabo en el Arrowhead Pond en Anaheim, donde el grupo realiza cuatro shows sold out. La combinaci\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 y Carlos Santana dej\u00f3 sin duda huella en el mercado de rock en espa\u00f1ol, como uno de los acontecimientos m\u00e1s grandes de la historia del g\u00e9nero en los Estados Unidos. En total Man\u00e1 y Santana hab\u00edan realizado 43 shows por Estados Unidos, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, Guadalajara, y Monterrey al finalizar la gira en diciembre de 1999. MTV Unplugged La cadena de videos MTV llevaba varios a\u00f1os solicitando a Man\u00e1 su participaci\u00f3n en la serie de grabaciones Unplugged, sin que la banda hubiese podido acceder a la petici\u00f3n debido a los compromisos que le significaban sus grabaciones y extensas giras. Finalmente se dieron las condiciones para el proyecto, por lo que el 9 de Marzo de 1999 la banda graba Man\u00e1 Unplugged en Miami ante un \u00edntimo publico de 70 afortunados fans. En dicho material el grupo incluye \u00e9xitos de su repertorio m\u00e1s 3 covers en modalidad ac\u00fastica; tambi\u00e9n contiene el interludio musical \u00a8Coladito\u00a8, duelo de percusi\u00f3n entre Alex G\u00f3nzalez y el m\u00fasico invitado Lu\u00eds Conte, donde se pude apreciar la destreza de ambos ejecutantes. El 22 de Junio de 1999 el material se lanza a la venta simult\u00e1neamente en todo el continente americano, alcanzando el primer lugar de ventas en el TOP 50 Latino de la revista Billboard, con lo cual la banda repite la haza\u00f1a de ser el \u00fanico grupo de rock latino en lograrlo. Hasta el momento, este disco sigue siendo uno de los m\u00e1s vendidos para la cadena de televisi\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de que fue el primer artista latino en lanzar un material de este tipo (CD/DVD). El primer sencillo que se desprendi\u00f3 de esta producci\u00f3n, tema original de Juan Gabriel, \u201cSe me olvid\u00f3 otra vez\u201d permaneci\u00f3 durante m\u00e1s de 5 semanas consecutivas en el primer lugar en las listas de radio de gran parte de M\u00e9xico y Latinoam\u00e9rica. \u201cTe solt\u00e9 la rienda\u201d, del compositor Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez fue otro exitos\u00edsimo sencillo que se desprendi\u00f3 de esta grabaci\u00f3n. A principios de enero del 2000, Man\u00e1 recibe la noticia de su nominaci\u00f3n a los premios Grammy en la categor\u00eda de Mejor \u00c1lbum de Pop Latino por su disco MTV Unplugged, esta era la tercera vez consecutiva que el grupo estaba nominado a tan afamados premios. La banda con muchas ganas de tocar arranca una gira por Sudam\u00e9rica y el Caribe el 17 de Marzo de 2000, visitando pa\u00edses como Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Uruguay, Puerto Rico y Republica Dominicana; las presentaciones en la capital Argentina lograron un \u00e9xito y expectaci\u00f3n impresionante, tras ofrecer un concierto en el Estadio Ferro de Buenos Aires a tan solo unas semanas de haber realizado 2 conciertos previos en el Luna Park de esa misma ciudad; lo mismo sucedi\u00f3 en el estadio Santa Laura, en Santiago de Chile. El resto de la gira luci\u00f3 con llenos totales en todos los lugares en donde Man\u00e1 se present\u00f3. A mediados del mes de abril en la ciudad de Miami, se celebraron los premios Billboard a la M\u00fasica Latina, en los cuales Man\u00e1 recibe 2 premios importantes, el primero al Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Pop Latino por su producci\u00f3n MTV Unplugged, y el segundo premio para la Fundaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica Selva Negra, denominado Spirit of Hope el cual se entrega \u00fanicamente a aquellos artistas que se han destacado por realizar acciones altruistas en pro del medio ambiente y de los derechos humanos. En estas mismas fechas el grupo recibe un reconocimiento que por primera vez se les otorga, el premio que concede la cadena de renta y venta de videos y m\u00fasica m\u00e1s grande de los Estados Unidos, el Block Buster Award por Mejor Artista Latino. En el mes de Junio Man\u00e1 comienza su Gira por Espa\u00f1a y las Canarias en un tour denominado Tourriata, visitando ciudades como: Tenerife, Pamplona, Zaragoza, Toledo, Santiago, Burgos, Palencia, Zamora, Barcelona, Madrid, Victoria, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Gijon, La Coru\u00f1a, Elche, San Javier Murcia, Valencia, Sevilla, San Fernando y M\u00e1laga. Cabe mencionar que en la capital espa\u00f1ola, las dos fechas en la plaza de toros Las Ventas fueron llenos totales, lo cual era una haza\u00f1a dif\u00edcil a\u00fan para los artistas de origen espa\u00f1ol, y un logro nunca antes alcanzado por una banda o artista latino. En el resto de la gira que realizaron a lo largo y ancho de la Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica lograron igualmente ventas totales. En el mes de septiembre el grupo asiste a la primera entrega del Grammy Latino, en donde junto con Carlos Santana interpretaron el tema \u201cCoraz\u00f3n espinado\u201d, siendo \u00e9ste unos de los momentos m\u00e1s memorables de la noche. En dicha ceremonia Man\u00e1 resulto ganador de 3 Grammy por su participaci\u00f3n en el \u00e1lbum del guitarrista. Durante su estancia en la ciudad de Los \u00c1ngeles, Man\u00e1 es invitado a interpretar el tema \u201cCoraz\u00f3n espinado\u201d al lado de Carlos Santana en el #1 talk show de los Estados Unidos \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d con Jay Leno, quien reconoci\u00f3 a Man\u00e1 como el grupo de rock pop latino m\u00e1s importante. La banda no para y lanza el compilatorio titulado Grandes Man\u00e1, cuya edici\u00f3n se hizo solamente para Europa y Escandinavia; a escasas semanas de haber salido a la venta ocup\u00f3 las primeras posiciones de la radio principalmente de la Pen\u00ednsula It\u00e1lica con el tema \u201cEn el Muelle de San Blas\u201d. Con este suceso Man\u00e1 visita en Noviembre del 2001 por primera vez Italia, en una gira promocional en la cual realizan un showcase en Mil\u00e1n para medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, personalidades y p\u00fablico en general. Italia adopt\u00f3 a Man\u00e1, la barrera del idioma se rompe y entran directo a los primeros lugares de la radio, apareciendo en las primeras planas de la prensa nacional Italiana. Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor A principios de 2002 la banda se encierra para componer y hacer demos de lo que ser\u00eda su pr\u00f3ximo disco de estudio a tres a\u00f1os del lanzamiento de Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos. Lanzan Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor en Junio de 2002, disco en \u00e9l que se muestra la b\u00fasqueda de la banda por mezclar su esencia con el sonido de rock de los sesentas y setentas, adem\u00e1s de otras fusiones de m\u00fasica latina. El resultado fue una colecci\u00f3n de grabaciones completamente energ\u00e9ticas, con un sonido que privilegia el de las guitarras pero que no renuncia a la b\u00fasqueda y la fusi\u00f3n. Este, su sexto \u00e1lbum de estudio, fue grabado en su totalidad en Los \u00c1ngeles, entre Febrero y Mayo de 2002 y cont\u00f3 con la participaci\u00f3n de Carlos Santana y su guitarra en el tema \u201cJusticia, Tierra y Libertad\u201d, as\u00ed como la de Rub\u00e9n Blades en \u201cS\u00e1banas fr\u00edas\u201d. Cabe destacar que el guitarrista del grupo, Sergio Vall\u00edn, particip\u00f3 cantando el tema \u201c\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 te vas?\u201d, dedicado a sus padres. Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor alcanz\u00f3 el primer lugar en ventas en Espa\u00f1a, Latinoam\u00e9rica y Estados Unidos durante cinco semanas consecutivas. Tuvo como sencillos m\u00e1s destacados \u201c\u00c1ngel de amor\u201d, \u201cEres mi religi\u00f3n\u201d y \u201cMariposa traicionera\u201d. Gracias al \u00e9xito obtenido en Italia, el cantante Zucchero los invita a participar en la canci\u00f3n \u201cBaila morena\u201d, dueto que resulta todo un \u00e9xito tanto en Am\u00e9rica como en Europa. Man\u00e1 le devuelve el gesto al cantante al invitarlo a participar en la canci\u00f3n \u201cEres mi religi\u00f3n\u201d pero ahora en italiano, que luego fue incluida en una edici\u00f3n especial del disco Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor editado en Europa. El 29 de Septiembre de 2002 Man\u00e1 se aventura a una nueva gira de dos a\u00f1os que los pondr\u00eda como nunca antes al mercado internacional. La gira llev\u00f3 al grupo no solo a ciudades de Estados Unidos, M\u00e9xico, Latinoam\u00e9rica y Espa\u00f1a, sino a nuevas plazas como Roma, Mil\u00e1n, Par\u00eds, Berl\u00edn, Eifel, Nuremberg, Munich, Stuggart, Hamburgo, R\u00edo de Janeiro y Sao Paolo. La primera incursi\u00f3n de la banda en el dif\u00edcil mercado brasile\u00f1o se dio con llenos totales; lo mismo sucedi\u00f3 en sus presentaciones en Italia, Francia y Alemania donde alcanzaron un lugar entre los 30 mejores \u00e1lbumes respecto a ventas. En total, el grupo realiz\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 100 conciertos en 24 pa\u00edses. Durante su estancia por Europa, la banda particip\u00f3 en el especial Pavarotti & Friends al lado de Zucchero, donde se presentaron con estrellas de la talla de Bono, Eric Clapton, Lionel Ritchie, Queen, Deep Purple, Ricky Martin y Andrea Bocceli. Man\u00e1 recibe dos nominaciones en la 4ta entrega de los Grammy Latino que se realizaron en Miami el 3 de Septiembre de 2003, en las categor\u00edas de Mejor Ingenier\u00eda de Grabaci\u00f3n para un \u00c1lbum y Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock por un D\u00fao o Grupo, llev\u00e1ndose esta \u00faltima presea. Esenciales Man\u00e1 El 18 de Noviembre de 2003 el grupo, cansado de tantos a\u00f1os de trabajo, decide tomar un a\u00f1o sab\u00e1tico y aprovechan para lanzar los recopilatorios Esenciales en tres versiones: Sol, Luna y Eclipse, que incluyen sus temas m\u00e1s exitosos y otras colaboraciones de la banda, como por ejemplo la versi\u00f3n de \u201cFool in the rain\u201d, canci\u00f3n original de Led Zeppelin incluida en el tributo Encomium al legendario grupo ingl\u00e9s y donde Man\u00e1 fue el \u00fanico artista latino invitado. Tambi\u00e9n se encuentra en la compilaci\u00f3n la canci\u00f3n in\u00e9dita \u201cTe llevar\u00e9 al cielo\u201d, tema que se convirti\u00f3 en todo un \u00e9xito, alcanzando r\u00e1pidamente los primeros lugares de popularidad en radio y video. A manera de agradecimiento a sus seguidores, deciden poner a la venta el 12 de Diciembre de 2004 el DVD llamado Acceso Total, el cual incluye im\u00e1genes del tour Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor (2002-2003) m\u00e1s escenas nunca antes vistas en camerinos, permiti\u00e9ndole a los fans tener \u2018acceso total\u2019 a la experiencia que vive Man\u00e1 en sus giras. Amar es Combatir Casi 5 a\u00f1os hab\u00edan pasado desde el \u00faltimo disco de estudio de la banda, Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor, por lo que ya corr\u00edan rumores y especulaciones sobre la separaci\u00f3n del grupo. Lo que nadie sab\u00eda era que tras su a\u00f1o sab\u00e1tico y desde principios de 2005, Man\u00e1 se reuni\u00f3 para empezar a componer su s\u00e9ptimo disco de estudio, Amar es Combatir. En Febrero de 2006 la banda decide viajar a Miami, ciudad siempre vibrante, abrazada por el ambiente tropical y con una esencia latina que se respira en el aire, comuni\u00f3n id\u00f3nea para inspirar la grabaci\u00f3n de este CD en el que la banda llev\u00f3 a cabo una fusi\u00f3n de rock, pop, m\u00fasica latina, reggae, hasta drum and bass. Producido por Fher y Alex, al igual que sus discos anteriores, Amar es Combatir fue lanzado el 22 de agosto de 2006 y es editado en 40 pa\u00edses alrededor del mundo, alcanzando el n\u00famero 4 en el Top 200 \u00c1lbumes de la revista Billboard en los Estados Unidos, r\u00e9cord solamente alcanzado para una producci\u00f3n enteramente en espa\u00f1ol por el \u00e1lbum Fijaci\u00f3n Oral Vol. 1 de Shakira. Su primer sencillo, \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d, permanece durante ocho semanas consecutivas en el primer lugar de los charts latinos de radio y es nombrado entre los medios latinos m\u00e1s reconocidos de la uni\u00f3n Americana como uno de los tracks m\u00e1s escuchados y premiados del 2006. Los sencillos que le siguieron, \u201cBendita tu luz\u201d (a d\u00fao con Ju\u00e1n Luis Guerra) y \u201cManda una se\u00f1al\u201d se posicionan tambi\u00e9n en el primer lugar de las listas de popularidad. A estos se agregar\u00eda un quinto sencillo, \u201cEl rey tibur\u00f3n\u201d, lo cual es un logro a destacar ya que es cada vez menos frecuente que de una producci\u00f3n se desprendan 5 sencillos, dada la complicada situaci\u00f3n por la que atraviesa la industria. En noviembre de 2006 el grupo participa en la 7ma edici\u00f3n del Grammy Latino, donde adem\u00e1s de actuar junto a Ju\u00e1n Luis Guerra con un excelente performance de sus \u00e9xitos, que les vali\u00f3 una sentida ovaci\u00f3n de parte de los asistentes al evento y que fue uno de los momentos cl\u00edmax de la velada, reciben un homenaje por su trayectoria art\u00edstica y logros en la m\u00fasica. En febrero de 2007 y tras recibir 5 nominaciones a los premios Billboard Latino, 4 nominaciones a los premios Lo Nuestro y una al Grammy Americano como Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Alternativo o Urbano, Man\u00e1 inicia su gira Amar Es Combatir World Tour, con la mayor producci\u00f3n que haya tenido el grupo hasta el momento (m\u00e1s de 60 toneladas de equipo), la cual los llevar\u00eda a dar 116 conciertos durante un per\u00edodo de un a\u00f1o y medio. Los conciertos de Man\u00e1 en Estados Unidos y Puerto Rico, incluyeron shows en ciudades como San Diego, Los \u00c1ngeles, Laredo, Houston, Corpus Christi, Miami, Orlando, Nueva York, Washington, Chicago, Atlanta y San Ju\u00e1n de Puerto Rico. Man\u00e1 se convierte en la primera banda de rock pop en espa\u00f1ol en llenar por tres noches (dos consecutivas) el Madison Square Garden de Nueva York. Destacan tambi\u00e9n sus cuatro conciertos sold out consecutivos en el Staple Center de Los \u00c1ngeles, tres noches sold out en el Miami American Airlines Arena, tres m\u00e1s en el Toyota Center de Houston y cuatro sold out en el Coliseo Jos\u00e9 M. Agrelot de Puerto Rico. Adem\u00e1s de reunirse en Washington D.C. con la senadora estadounidense Hillary Clinton para compartir opiniones sobre el medio ambiente y migraci\u00f3n, Man\u00e1 recibe un reconocimiento por las m\u00e1s de 450,000 descargas de su ringtone \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d. Su gira por Latinoam\u00e9rica incluy\u00f3 conciertos en Chile, Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Panam\u00e1, Venezuela, Colombia, Per\u00fa, Brasil y Rep\u00fablica Dominicana. El grupo toc\u00f3 en grandes foros, de los cuales destacan los conciertos del grupo en Argentina: tres presentaciones en el Estadio Velez de Buenos Aires as\u00ed como en el Estadio Chateau Carrera de C\u00f3rdoba, el Estadio Central en Rosario y el Estadio Malvinas en Mendoza. Otras presentaciones de gran relevancia fueron: Estadio Defensores del Chaco en Asunci\u00f3n, Estadio del Ej\u00e9rcito en Guatemala, Estadio M\u00e1gico en San Salvador, Estadio de Futbol de Managhua, Estadio Ol\u00edmpico de Caracas, el Parque Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar en Bogot\u00e1, Estadio Alberto Spencer en Guayaquil, Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Atahualpa en Quito, Estadio Alejandro Serrano en Cuenca, Credicard Hall en Sao Paulo, Citibank Hall en Rio de Janeiro, Estadio Gigantinho en Porto Alegre y el Estadio Quisquella en Santo Domingo. Durante Junio y Julio de 2007 llevan su gira a Espa\u00f1a, donde rompen records al posicionarse como el artista latino de mayor convocatoria en la madre patria, al vender todas las localidades para sus conciertos en 15 provincias: Zaragoza, Pamplona, Bilbao, Gij\u00f3n, Santiago, Le\u00f3n, Barcelona, Madrid, Murcia, Alicante, Albacete, M\u00e1laga, Sevilla, Las Palmas y Tenerife. Cabe destacar la nominaci\u00f3n del grupo en los premios World Music Awards, realizados en M\u00f3naco, Francia. Este premio se entrega de acuerdo a las ventas que un artista logr\u00f3 durante un a\u00f1o y donde Man\u00e1 comparti\u00f3 escenario al lado de artistas como Celine Dion, Avril Lavigne, Rihanna, Patty Labelle, entre otros. Entre los premios m\u00e1s destacados que la banda obtuvo por esta producci\u00f3n se encuentra un Grammy Americano en el rubro de Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Alternativo o Urbano, 3 galardones Lo Nuestro por \u00c1lbum de Rock del A\u00f1o, Artista Rock del A\u00f1o y canci\u00f3n Rock del A\u00f1o; 2 Billboard Latinos por \u00c1lbum Rock Alternativo del A\u00f1o y tema Pop Airplay del A\u00f1o de D\u00fao o Grupo. Arde El Cielo La impresionante respuesta que tuvo la gira Amar Es Combatir World Tour fue una experiencia sorprendente para la banda, por lo que decidieron capturar esa energ\u00eda, esa adrenalina, en una grabaci\u00f3n con la cual sus seguidores pudieran recordar y revivir esos momentos. As\u00ed, la banda decide grabar dos de sus cuatro presentaciones en el Coliseo Jos\u00e9 M. Agrelot de Puerto Rico en Marzo de 2007. El 29 de Abril del mismo a\u00f1o Man\u00e1 presenta en Los \u00c1ngeles el CD/DVD llamado Arde el Cielo, el cual fue grabado durante el Amar Es Combatir World Tour. El material contiene 12 temas en directo que representan y repasan la historia de Man\u00e1, desde \u201cRayando el sol\u201d a \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d, pasando por \u201cEl rey\u201d y canciones tan conocidas como \u201cEn el Muelle de San Blas\" o \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d, as\u00ed como dos temas in\u00e9ditos grabados en estudio. El primero de estos temas in\u00e9ditos es \"Si no te hubieras ido\", una canci\u00f3n de Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds ya versionada por otros artistas pero en la que Man\u00e1 supo poner su peculiar sello. El segundo tema in\u00e9dito del CD es \"Arde el cielo\" un tema compuesto por Fher y producido en conjunto con \u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez. Ambos temas serian hits en 2008.

They became a very well-known and popular band in the Bay area in the mid-sixties. At first they played mainly r&b, but later started to add Latin music to the mix.\n\n\nThree or four years into the career of the Malibus, a guitarist was brought in by the name of Jorge Santana, the brother of the already famous Carlos Santana. In 1970 the Malibus changed their name to Malo and things started happening. At times numbering as many as ten or more musicians, Malo's powerful sound was different to that of Santana in that the line-up included a serious horn section, which included, at various times, leading trumpet player Luis Gasca, as well as percussionists Coke Escovedo, Francisco Aguabella, Victor Pantoja and Richard Bean (of Sapo fame).\n\n\nThey were signed to Warner Brothers Records and recorded their first album, which was simply entitled \"Malo\" (BS-2584). Arcelio co-wrote four of the six songs, including their classics \"Nena\" and \"Cafe.\" Released in 1972, \"Malo\" also included \u201cSuavecito,\" which had evolved from a song they had written and been doing in clubs called \u201cMy Love.\u201d\n\n\nOne of the band members at the time, Richard Bean, wrote a new lyric which gave birth to a major hit record. Malo members Pablo Tellez and Abel Zarate also got credit for the composition.\n\n\nWarner Brothers released Malo's second album, \"Dos\" in 1972, followed by \"Evolution\" in 1973. Illness kept Arcelio Garcia out of the group for a year in 74-75. This was the period when Little Willie G., formerly of Thee Midniters of East L.A., came in and became lead singer for Malo. Willie did one album entitled \u201cAscenci\u00f3n\u201d and toured with the band. This album was Malo's last with Warner Brothers.\n\n\nBack in good health, Arcelio, who owns the Malo name and logo, moved to New York and started Malo anew. This resulted in the release of Malo V in 1981. Arcelio then came back to the West Coast, where he has been based ever since.\n\n\nMalo's current lineup includes:\n\nArcelio Garcia, lead vocals; Ramiro Amador, bass; David George, drums; Gabriel Manzo, lead guitar; Jay Rossette, 2nd lead guitar; Daniel Cervantes, keyboards; Frank Bailey, lead trumpet; Pete Rodriguez, trumpet, trombone; Jack Musgrove trumpet, flogahorn; and Tony Menjivar, congas / timbales. Another addition to the current Malo is Arcelio\u2019s son, Octaviano, an excellent singer and performer in his own right.\nSite Designed by Skipnosis Studios", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8794432.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.132974, 37.708728], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Latin, R&b/soul, Funk, Latin Rock, Bass, Rnb-soul", "OtherInfo": "Get up close and personal with the legendary Latin hit makers Malo, live in concert.

A prolific composer and prodigious six-string talent, Di Meola has amassed over 20 albums as a leader while collaborating on a dozen or so others with the likes of Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White, John McLaughlin, Paco de Lucia, Jean-Luc Ponty and more. And while his dazzling technique on both acoustic and electric guitars has afforded him regal status among hordes of frettboard aficionados who regularly flock to his concerts, the depth of Di Meola's writing and compositions along with the soulfulness of his guitar expressions, have won him legions of fans worldwide.\n\nA pioneer of blending world music and jazz, going back to early Latin-tinged fusion outings like 1976's Land of the Midnight Sun, 1977's Elegant Gypsy and 1978's Casino, the guitar great has continued to explore the rich influence of flamenco, tango, Middle Eastern, Brazilian and African music throughout his long career.\n\nDi Meola\u2019s most recent release, 2013\u2019s \"All Your Life\", was an acoustic tour de force that had him revisiting the music of a seminal influence \u2013 The Beatles. \u201cI really credit the Beatles for the reason why I play guitar,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a major catalyst for me to want to learn music. So their impact was pretty strong.\u201d A virtual one-man show of virtuosity, it features the guitar great interpreting 14 familiar Beatles tunes in the stripped-down setting of strictly acoustic guitar. All the tracks are imbued with the guitarist\u2019s signature flamenco flourishes, intricate arpeggiating and dazzling cross-picking. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, where the Beatles created most of their records during their heyday, \"All Your Life\" stands as a triumph in the long and illustrious career of a bona fide guitar hero. \u201cI\u2019ve come full circle with this,\u201d says Di Meola. \u201cI started out my life loving the Beatles, and I never stopped, just like a lot of so many other guitarists from my generation. In the middle, we all went into whatever music we pursued in our careers -- fusion, jazz, whatever it might be. We all wanted to further our craft. But when you come back to the Beatles\u2019 music, it\u2019s like; \u201cMan, this stuff is still happening! All of it!\u201d\n\nDi Meola's ongoing fascination with complex rhythmic syncopation combined with provocative lyrical melodies and sophisticated harmony has been at the heart of his music throughout a celebrated career that has earned him critical accolades, three gold albums and more than six million in record sales worldwide. He has been particularly enamored over the past 20 years by the tango music of the late great Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla, whose compositions he has interpreted over time, beginning with 1990's Di Meola Plays Piazzolla, continuing to 1993's Heart of the Immigrants, 2002's Flesh on Flesh and right up to 2007's Diabolic Inventions and Seduction for Solo Guitar.\n\"Piazzolla had a profound effect on my development as a musician and as a person,\u201d says Al. \u201cWe became close friends, often communicating by mail. And during the course of this friendship my admiration and desire to learn more about this great man intensified.\u201d\n\nA native of New Jersey who still resides in the Garden State along with a home in Miami, Di Meola was born in Jersey City on July 22, 1954. Growing up in Bergenfield with the music of Elvis Presley, The Ventures and The Beatles, he naturally gravitated to guitar as a youngster and by his early teens was already an accomplished player. Attaining such impressive skills at such a young age didn't come easy for Al but rather was the result of focused dedication and intensive periods of woodshedding between his junior and senior years in high school. \u201cI used to practice the guitar eight to ten hours a day,\u201d he told DownBeat. \u201cAnd I was trying to find myself, or find the kind of music that suited where I was going with the guitar.\u201d\n\nIn 1971, Al enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and by the second semester began playing in a fusion quartet led by keyboardist Barry Miles. A gig tape of that band was later passed on to Chick Corea by a friend of Al's, and in the early part of 1974 the 19-year-old guitarist was tapped to join the fusion super group as a replacement for guitarist Bill Connors. \u201cI was just sitting around my apartment in Boston on a Friday afternoon when Chick called and asked me to come to a rehearsal in New York,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI couldn't believe it. But in 10 minutes I packed some clothes in a bag, got a ride to New York and never saw that apartment in Boston again.\u201d\n\nFollowing a weekend of rehearsals with Chick, Stanley Clarke and Lenny White, Di Meola made his Return to Forever debut at Carnegie Hall on July 3, 1974, officially launching his career into the stratosphere. \"Playing with Chick in Return To Forever was the first significant step in my development as a player,\u201d says Al. After three landmark recordings with Return To Forever \u2013 1974's Where Have I Known You Before, 1975's Grammy Award winning No Mystery and 1976's Romantic Warrior \u2013 the group disbanded and Al subsequently started up his career as a solo artist.\n\nHis 1976 debut as a leader, Land of the Midnight Sun, was a blazing showcase of his signature chops and Latin-tinged compositions that featured a stellar cast including drummers Steve Gadd and Lenny White, bassist Anthony Jackson and Jaco Pastorius, keyboardists Jan Hammer, Barry Miles and Chick Corea, and percussionist Mingo Lewis. Over the course of six more albums with Columbia Records \u2013 Elegant Gypsy, Casino, Splendido Hotel, Electric Rendezvous, Tour De Force and Scenario \u2013 Al established himself as an influential force in contemporary music.\n\n1980 marked the triumph of the acoustic guitar Trio with Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin. Their debut recording on Columbia Records, Friday Night in San Francisco, became a landmark recording that surpassed the two million mark in sales. The following year, 1981, Di Meola was inducted into Guitar Player\u2019s Gallery of Greats after four consecutive wins as Best Jazz Guitarist in the magazine\u2019s Readers Poll. The three virtuosos in the Trio toured together from 1980 through 1983, releasing the studio album Passion, Grace & Fire in 1982. In 1995, they reunited for a third recording, Guitar Trio, follow by another triumphant world tour. In early 1996, Di Meola formed a new trio with the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and RTF band mate Stanley Clarke called The Rite of Strings. Their self-titled debut was released in 1995. Di Meola subsequently recorded with the likes of opera superstar Luciano Pavarotti, pop stars Paul Simon and Dave Matthews, classical guitarist Manuel Barrueco, Japanese jazz pianist Yutaka Kobayashi and Italian pop star Pino Daniele. Over the course of his career, he has also worked and recorded with Phil Collins, Carlos Santana, Steve Winwood, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Milton Naciemento, Egberto Gismonti, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Jimmy Page, Steve Vai and Frank Zappa.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, Di Meola invited the great Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba to tour with him on some concert appearances which were greeted by fans with great applause.\n\nNow in early 2015 Di Meola is working on recording his newest album titled; ELYSIUM, and will be touring North America and Europe with many dates already booked.\n\nVisit: http://www.aldimeola.com/#!tour/c9a0\n\nAlbum recordings can be found at:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/al-di-meola/id814570\n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/al-di-meola-mn0000600228/discography\n\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Al+Di+Meola/+albums", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8725426.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.285583, 38.29958], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Jazz Fusion, Jazz Instrument, Fusion, Flamenco", "OtherInfo": "Full Food and Bar Menu Available in all sections PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE - 45 Years On Stage Tour 2019During a 40-plus year career marked by hugely influential recordings and worldwide tours, Di Meola has regenerated the jazz idiom three times over while dedicating himself to his art.

After three landmark recordings with Return To Forever \u2013 1974's Where Have I Known You Before, 1975's Grammy Award winning No Mystery and 1976's Romantic Warrior \u2013 the group disbanded and Al subsequently started up his career as a solo artist.\n\nHis 1976 debut as a leader, Land of the Midnight Sun, was a blazing showcase of his signature chops and Latin-tinged compositions that featured a stellar cast including drummers Steve Gadd and Lenny White, bassist Anthony Jackson and Jaco Pastorius, keyboardists Jan Hammer, Barry Miles and Chick Corea, and percussionist Mingo Lewis. Over the course of six more albums with Columbia Records \u2013 Elegant Gypsy, Casino, Splendido Hotel, Electric Rendezvous, Tour De Force and Scenario \u2013 Al established himself as an influential force in contemporary music.\n\n1980 marked the triumph of the acoustic guitar Trio with Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin. Their debut recording on Columbia Records, Friday Night in San Francisco, became a landmark recording that surpassed the two million mark in sales. The following year, 1981, Di Meola was inducted into Guitar Player\u2019s Gallery of Greats after four consecutive wins as Best Jazz Guitarist in the magazine\u2019s Readers Poll. The three virtuosos in the Trio toured together from 1980 through 1983, releasing the studio album Passion, Grace & Fire in 1982. In 1995, they reunited for a third recording, Guitar Trio, follow by another triumphant world tour. In early 1996, Di Meola formed a new trio with the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and RTF band mate Stanley Clarke called The Rite of Strings. Their self-titled debut was released in 1995. Di Meola subsequently recorded with the likes of opera superstar Luciano Pavarotti, pop stars Paul Simon and Dave Matthews, classical guitarist Manuel Barrueco, Japanese jazz pianist Yutaka Kobayashi and Italian pop star Pino Daniele. Over the course of his career, he has also worked and recorded with Phil Collins, Carlos Santana, Steve Winwood, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Milton Naciemento, Egberto Gismonti, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Jimmy Page, Steve Vai and Frank Zappa.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, Di Meola invited the great Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba to tour with him on some concert appearances which were greeted by fans with great applause.\n\nNow in early 2015 Di Meola is working on recording his newest album titled; ELYSIUM, and will be touring North America and Europe with many dates already booked.\n\nVisit: http://www.aldimeola.com/#!tour/c9a0\n\nAlbum recordings can be found at:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/al-di-meola/id814570\n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/al-di-meola-mn0000600228/discography\n\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Al+Di+Meola/+albums", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.640098, 38.233411], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "Doors 7:30pm // Show 8:30pm // Ages 21+", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Mystic Theatre"}, {"Address": "2840 Roblar Rd, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Attila.Viola and The Bakersfield Boys", "ArtistBio": "Al Di Meola\n\nA bona fide guitar hero and perennial poll-winner, Al Di Meola has been recognized internationally over the past four decades as a virtuoso of the highest order. A prolific composer and prodigious six-string talent, Di Meola has amassed over 20 albums as a leader while collaborating on a dozen or so others with the likes of Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White, John McLaughlin, Paco de Lucia, Jean-Luc Ponty and more. And while his dazzling technique on both acoustic and electric guitars has afforded him regal status among hordes of frettboard aficionados who regularly flock to his concerts, the depth of Di Meola's writing and compositions along with the soulfulness of his guitar expressions, have won him legions of fans worldwide.\n\nA pioneer of blending world music and jazz, going back to early Latin-tinged fusion outings like 1976's Land of the Midnight Sun, 1977's Elegant Gypsy and 1978's Casino, the guitar great has continued to explore the rich influence of flamenco, tango, Middle Eastern, Brazilian and African music throughout his long career.\n\nDi Meola\u2019s most recent release, 2013\u2019s \"All Your Life\", was an acoustic tour de force that had him revisiting the music of a seminal influence \u2013 The Beatles. \u201cI really credit the Beatles for the reason why I play guitar,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a major catalyst for me to want to learn music. So their impact was pretty strong.\u201d A virtual one-man show of virtuosity, it features the guitar great interpreting 14 familiar Beatles tunes in the stripped-down setting of strictly acoustic guitar. All the tracks are imbued with the guitarist\u2019s signature flamenco flourishes, intricate arpeggiating and dazzling cross-picking. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, where the Beatles created most of their records during their heyday, \"All Your Life\" stands as a triumph in the long and illustrious career of a bona fide guitar hero. \u201cI\u2019ve come full circle with this,\u201d says Di Meola. \u201cI started out my life loving the Beatles, and I never stopped, just like a lot of so many other guitarists from my generation. In the middle, we all went into whatever music we pursued in our careers -- fusion, jazz, whatever it might be. We all wanted to further our craft. But when you come back to the Beatles\u2019 music, it\u2019s like; \u201cMan, this stuff is still happening! All of it!\u201d\n\nDi Meola's ongoing fascination with complex rhythmic syncopation combined with provocative lyrical melodies and sophisticated harmony has been at the heart of his music throughout a celebrated career that has earned him critical accolades, three gold albums and more than six million in record sales worldwide. He has been particularly enamored over the past 20 years by the tango music of the late great Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla, whose compositions he has interpreted over time, beginning with 1990's Di Meola Plays Piazzolla, continuing to 1993's Heart of the Immigrants, 2002's Flesh on Flesh and right up to 2007's Diabolic Inventions and Seduction for Solo Guitar.\n\"Piazzolla had a profound effect on my development as a musician and as a person,\u201d says Al. \u201cWe became close friends, often communicating by mail. And during the course of this friendship my admiration and desire to learn more about this great man intensified.\u201d\n\nA native of New Jersey who still resides in the Garden State along with a home in Miami, Di Meola was born in Jersey City on July 22, 1954. Growing up in Bergenfield with the music of Elvis Presley, The Ventures and The Beatles, he naturally gravitated to guitar as a youngster and by his early teens was already an accomplished player. Attaining such impressive skills at such a young age didn't come easy for Al but rather was the result of focused dedication and intensive periods of woodshedding between his junior and senior years in high school. \u201cI used to practice the guitar eight to ten hours a day,\u201d he told DownBeat. \u201cAnd I was trying to find myself, or find the kind of music that suited where I was going with the guitar.\u201d\n\nIn 1971, Al enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and by the second semester began playing in a fusion quartet led by keyboardist Barry Miles. A gig tape of that band was later passed on to Chick Corea by a friend of Al's, and in the early part of 1974 the 19-year-old guitarist was tapped to join the fusion super group as a replacement for guitarist Bill Connors. \u201cI was just sitting around my apartment in Boston on a Friday afternoon when Chick called and asked me to come to a rehearsal in New York,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI couldn't believe it. But in 10 minutes I packed some clothes in a bag, got a ride to New York and never saw that apartment in Boston again.\u201d\n\nFollowing a weekend of rehearsals with Chick, Stanley Clarke and Lenny White, Di Meola made his Return to Forever debut at Carnegie Hall on July 3, 1974, officially launching his career into the stratosphere. \"Playing with Chick in Return To Forever was the first significant step in my development as a player,\u201d says Al.

In the last few years they've shared the stage with bands like Helmet, Fu Manchu, Oxbow, Coliseum, Black Cobra, Future of the Left, Bison BC, Church of Misery, Fatso Jetson, Yawning Man, and Eagles of Death Metal.\n\n\"If you ask Disastroid to describe themselves they may just shrug you off.

The band features Kyle Gibson (The Fresh & Onlys) on drums, Gustavo Mendoza (Curl Up & Die) on bass, and Jesse Robeck (HIDES) on guitar and lead vocals.

His dance music roots lie in Disco of the 70\u2019s and New Wave of the 80\u2019s. Presently living in San Francisco, he was born and raised in Montreal, Canada, and got tuned into dance music through the city\u2019s flourishing club scene and diverse radio broadcasts. He started collecting vinyl records in the mid 70\u2019s and took to the turntables in 1985, scoring his first major club gig two years later. Hearing the non-stop flow of music and observing the booth where the DJ seamlessly blended each selection were early influences for Julius. Later influences included reading about DJ residencies that were piloted by talented club music programmers that even today, influence the youngest of aspiring DJ\u2019s - legends like David Mancuso at The Loft & Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage in New York City to Frankie Knuckles at The Warehouse in Chicago and Tony Humphries\u2019 weekly at Zanzibar in New Jersey. Always inspired by the music listed in those articles, Julius would shop for those titles that would later become classics, worshipped by their discerning audiences. To this day, his goal is to keep expanding his foundation in music by being open-minded and eclectic in absorbing the music that truly touches him. That open-minded attitude is what Julius uses to fine-tune his musical palette, which gives him a dominant sound that exudes a deep and soulful perspective. That dominant sound is (Soulful) House Music \u2013 which to him, is about an uplifting positive message. People coming together in unity, with no barriers or restrictions, but rather, with tolerance and the spirit of music, unifying everyone on the dance-floor. That being said, he blends various musical styles together - including Soul, Latin, Afro, Disco, Jazz and Electronic sounds with such fluidity, that it is difficult at times to put a defining stamp on his sound. Contributing to that is his willingness to take a chance. He always tries to push the envelope by introducing music that deserves exposure, taking his audience on a musical journey with various mood and energy changes. Not content to limiting his ambitions in the DJ booth, Julius began producing music in 1994. The studio was another outlet for Julius\u2019 creative ideas to flow. His first release was a down-tempo project on the Acid Jazz tip. He also drew attention as part of the jazz and funk scene in San Francisco via the Mushroom Jazz parties alongside resident Mark Farina. As Julius\u2019 production catalogue grew, so did the amount of labels he released music on including \u2013 long tenured labels like King ST (NYC), Nervous Records (NYC), Large Music (Chicago) and OM (SF), to signings on Soulfuric Recordings (FL) and Kenny Dope\u2019s \u201cDope Wax\u201d (NYC) label, as well as Bob Sinclar\u2019s own Yellow Productions in Paris. He also ventured into the label arena with his own \u201cNeoDisco Music\u201d imprint. Named after the sound that continues to inspire him \u2013 the label offers him an alternate outlet to release his own productions. As a veteran in the club scene, Julius has refined a style of dance music that has taken him beyond the boundaries of San Francisco to global praise and recognition. Being nominated as \u201cMost Innovative Producer\u201d at the 2004 House Music Awards is a perfect example of that. Putting him in the company of other nominated producers like, Joey Negro, Osunlade, DJ Gregory, DJ Spinna and Ben Watt was an absolute honor for him. Upcoming releases for 2014 include a compilation/mix CD entitled \u201cA Long Hot Summer\u201d on King ST Recordings (NYC) as well as Julius\u2019 next full-length, artist-album, plus several singles. Recent production highlights include; Julius\u2019s collaboration with Lisa Shaw entitled \u201cWay Back,\u201d (DJ Smash Brooklyn Tech Remix), featured on the CBS crime drama, CSI: Miami; The song \u201cBelieve\u201d (with Deep Culture & Deborah Bond), included on Danny Krivit\u2019s 10 Year Anniversary, 718 Sessions, compilation/mix CD on Nervous Records. \u201cMusic Is The Key.\u201d Music Producer / DJ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6310748.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.408312, 37.780964], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: R&b/soul, Nu Disco, Downtempo, Deep House, Electronic, Disco, Soulful House Music, Rnb-soul", "OtherInfo": "On Saturday, September 28th, SALTED is back at Monarch for an intimate affair\u2026\n\nJoin us as we welcome back special guest DERRICK MCKENZIE, drummer extraordinaire from Jamiroquai playing a special DJ set downstairs along with MIGUEL MIGS and JULIUS PAPP.\n\nUpstairs features \u201cGood For You\u201d records label boss KENNY SUMMIT dropping a Nu Disco/Classic Disco/Disco House set with Diskophonic resident FRANKY BOISSY.\n\n\n9:30pm-3am | 21+", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Monarch"}, {"Address": "101 6th st, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Salted", "ArtistBio": "Julius Papp is one whose dedication to music has propelled his career as a producer and DJ in the dance/club music scene.

That open-minded attitude is what Julius uses to fine-tune his musical palette, which gives him a dominant sound that exudes a deep and soulful perspective. That dominant sound is (Soulful) House Music \u2013 which to him, is about an uplifting positive message. People coming together in unity, with no barriers or restrictions, but rather, with tolerance and the spirit of music, unifying everyone on the dance-floor. That being said, he blends various musical styles together - including Soul, Latin, Afro, Disco, Jazz and Electronic sounds with such fluidity, that it is difficult at times to put a defining stamp on his sound. Contributing to that is his willingness to take a chance. He always tries to push the envelope by introducing music that deserves exposure, taking his audience on a musical journey with various mood and energy changes. Not content to limiting his ambitions in the DJ booth, Julius began producing music in 1994. The studio was another outlet for Julius\u2019 creative ideas to flow. His first release was a down-tempo project on the Acid Jazz tip. He also drew attention as part of the jazz and funk scene in San Francisco via the Mushroom Jazz parties alongside resident Mark Farina. As Julius\u2019 production catalogue grew, so did the amount of labels he released music on including \u2013 long tenured labels like King ST (NYC), Nervous Records (NYC), Large Music (Chicago) and OM (SF), to signings on Soulfuric Recordings (FL) and Kenny Dope\u2019s \u201cDope Wax\u201d (NYC) label, as well as Bob Sinclar\u2019s own Yellow Productions in Paris. He also ventured into the label arena with his own \u201cNeoDisco Music\u201d imprint. Named after the sound that continues to inspire him \u2013 the label offers him an alternate outlet to release his own productions. As a veteran in the club scene, Julius has refined a style of dance music that has taken him beyond the boundaries of San Francisco to global praise and recognition. Being nominated as \u201cMost Innovative Producer\u201d at the 2004 House Music Awards is a perfect example of that. Putting him in the company of other nominated producers like, Joey Negro, Osunlade, DJ Gregory, DJ Spinna and Ben Watt was an absolute honor for him. Upcoming releases for 2014 include a compilation/mix CD entitled \u201cA Long Hot Summer\u201d on King ST Recordings (NYC) as well as Julius\u2019 next full-length, artist-album, plus several singles. Recent production highlights include; Julius\u2019s collaboration with Lisa Shaw entitled \u201cWay Back,\u201d (DJ Smash Brooklyn Tech Remix), featured on the CBS crime drama, CSI: Miami; The song \u201cBelieve\u201d (with Deep Culture & Deborah Bond), included on Danny Krivit\u2019s 10 Year Anniversary, 718 Sessions, compilation/mix CD on Nervous Records. \u201cMusic Is The Key.\u201d Music Producer / DJ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.408312, 37.780964], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "Salted w/ Derrick Mackenzie, Miguel Migs, Julius Papp", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Monarch"}, {"Address": "101 6th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Miguel Migs", "ArtistBio": "MIGUEL MIGS BIOGRAPHY\n\nMiguel Migs grew up in Northern California on his parent\u2019s diverse collection of classic rock, blues, funk, soul and reggae records \u2013 which helped set the tone for his musical inspirations. He infuses these creative influences into his own sound, which combines this wide range of styles, blending them together into his own unique artistry.\n\nMigs emerged from the 90\u2019s deep house underground scene to become the kind of artist who transcends the stylistic limitations of a genre so very few can. His musical journey began after picking up a guitar in his early teenage years and his first outlet was writing songs and playing in Dub/Reggae bands. Although Migs always loved and listened to all different styles of music, in the early 90\u2019s he connected to the soulful sounds of Deep House. By the mid \u201990s he began experimenting with producing electronic dance music. And by the time the new millennium dawned, a string of releases and remixes on numerous leading indie dance labels earned him an enviable reputation among discerning dance music fans worldwide. As Petalpusher, he\u2019d also become a stalwart of the hugely influential Naked Music stable with his original productions, remixes and compilations.\n\nBut even bigger things were to follow.\n\nRead full bio here: http://miguelmigs.com/bio", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6973912.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.408312, 37.780964], "Date": "Sat Sep 28 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-28", "Genre": "Genres: Dance Music, Electronic, Deep House, Soulful House, Nu Disco", "OtherInfo": "On Saturday, September 28th, SALTED is back at Monarch for an intimate affair\u2026\n\nJoin us as we welcome back special guest DERRICK MCKENZIE, drummer extraordinaire from Jamiroquai playing a special DJ set downstairs along with MIGUEL MIGS and JULIUS PAPP.\n\nUpstairs features \u201cGood For You\u201d records label boss KENNY SUMMIT dropping a Nu Disco/Classic Disco/Disco House set with Diskophonic resident FRANKY BOISSY.\n\n\n9:30pm-3am | 21+", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Monarch"}, {"Address": "399 9th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Darkroom", "ArtistBio": "Built from the ground up.

Sander van Doorn entered the musical scene in 1995, aged just sixteen. His brother\u2019s latest gadget at the time, a Roland Groovebox 303, caught his attention. He was astounded when he first experienced the amount of creativity that could be put into making electronic music. Time and time again, Sander would borrow his brother\u2019s Groovebox and his nephew\u2019s vinyl records and he played the life out of those records. Since then, Sander\u2019s heart belonged to music and it still does today. Sander has created his own inimitable sound and style. He is a producer at heart, and started DJing to create exposure for his productions. It\u2019s basically impossible to appoint one specific genre to him; his music gets influenced by a very broad spectrum of factors. He continues to be an immensely prolific and diverse producer, with his own monstrous solo output plus massive collabs helping him to amass millions of plays on YouTube and Spotify. Gold Skies has picked up well over 60 million plays alone, making for one of the biggest hits of his career so far. His A&R skills show no sign of faltering either with his DOORN Records imprint unleashing a steady stream of big names and hot new talents alike. 2017 saw him launch his exciting alias Purple Haze, dedicated to a \u201csharper, darker, rougher\u201d sound. The project was unveiled at Ultra Music Festival with a spectacular audio-visual live show that vividly brought to life his new concept. Later in the year he released the debut Purple Haze album, SPECTRVM: a riot of dark trance and tough techno with some standout vocals to boot. Rather than taking shine away from his usual SvD sounds, the new project has created a positive, synergised feedback loop in his studio, bringing a yin to his existing yang. \u201cToo often I\u2019ve seen artists lose their focus when they try to combine too many different sounds\u201d he says, \u201cbut I get so much creative energy from working on this project that it\u2019s actually added to the creative flow for Sander van Doorn.\u201d It\u2019s just the start for Purple Haze, with some very big plans in the works \u2014 and with such a positive reaction from fans, more material is hotly anticipated. Today, Sander has performed thousands of shows in every corner of the world and released numerous solo records, yet he is still part of a group of innovative and progressive artists. Sander\u2019s creative process exists of re-inventing musical styles, taking risks in regards to the sound he creates and most importantly staying ahead of the masses. Regular appearances at world-beating clubs and festivals like Creamfields, Tomorrowland, UNTOLD Festival and Electric Daisy Carnival pepper his hectic diary which sees him plays to tens of thousands across the globe every month. With three full-length albums, numerous hit-singles, remixes of the world\u2019s biggest artists, sold-out gigs in all major venues and festivals worldwide, his own successful record label and a weekly radio show named Identity, Sander van Doorn continues his musical journey into the heart of fans around the world www.facebook.com/sandervandoorn www.twitter.com/sandervandoorn www.youtube.com/sandervandoorntv www.instagram.com/sandervandoornofficial Sander van Doorn - Riff ( SvD x David Tort Remix) is available on November now!

Either way, it\u2019s safe to assume that Larry June, born Larry Hendricks, is the most colorful and unique rapper out right now spreading an authentic message of health and positivity.\n\nBorn April 8, 1991, in San Francisco to a musical family, Larry cites his cousin, a young rapper signed to Too Short, as the primary reason he went into music. June made his first beat around age 7 and 8 and released his first mixtape when he was 16 without any formal training, instead explaining that he \u201cjust got into rapping.\u201d The San Francisco native also calls Atlanta home, citing the two cities\u2019s variety of sounds, tempos, coasts and cultures as crucial to his music.\n\nEvident from his clever and musical ad libbing, the rapper gains most of his inspiration from Bootsy Collins, James Brown, and Michael Jackson. Much like these artists, June uses his voice as a musical agent, or, as he puts it, \u201cI look at ad libs as the instrument with the beat.\u201d He often freestyles adding to the witty charm obvious in his tracks and the fervent energy with a slowed-down groove element akin to the 70s soul music June listens to everyday\u2014complete with a photo of Lionel Richie on his refrigerator.\n\nInside his fridge, however, must be a plethora of oranges as the rapper is known for his iconic health advice and benefits of Vitamin C. The color is reminiscent of the 70s aesthetic and sound June seeks in his music and the health benefits of the fruit propagate his message of being good: \u201cYou got an orange, you\u2019re doing good.\u201d This playful element is reiterated in June\u2019s visual work and complementary material, such as the iOS game Orange Season accompanying his EP of the same name. June has plans to create a new, more impactful game in the future hinting at a possible collaboration.\n\nWhile June comes across as clever and humorous in his freestyles and symbolisms, his flow is nowhere near lighthearted territory. June displays an impressive command of his flows, never breaking his characteristic monotone delivery and easily spits out messages of life\u2019s complexities and nuances without missing a beat. After touring with Post Malone, who discovered him on Twitter with the internet buzzing around June\u2019s music, and tours with Asher Roth under his belt, the rapper secured a deal with Warner Bros. and is expected to release his new EP You\u2019re Doing Good.\n\nThe EP marks a departure from his previous EPs Larry and Orange Season with its experimental component in the production. \u201cI experimented with a lot of different sounds and wanted to try something with it. The flows didn\u2019t really change, it\u2019s just the beats that changed,\u201d says the rapper. The album came from a desire to create and maintain a positive outlook: \u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t feeling too good so I wanted to change to a positive perspective\u2014you\u2019re doing good because you are good,\u201d says June. He attributes the music to what his state of mind was at the time and this attempt to try every type of sound\u2014hence the experimental aspect of You\u2019re Doing Good.\n\nIndeed, You\u2019re Doing Good is heavily inspiring from the 80s influenced \u201cToo Live Crew\u201d to the more soul-inspired, bedroom jams \u201cThrow Sum\u201d and \u201cFall in Love\u201d. Each track is both stylistically and content-wise a bit different, but maintains that characteristic Larry June ethos. Of his top 3 tracks, June chooses \u201cSo Organic\u201d, \u201cToo Live Crew\u201d, and \u201cTell Me You Love Me\u201d for their distinct moods\u2014the \u201cbest moods\u201d for songs and some degree of relatability for everyone according to the rapper.\n\nJune continues the heat, health, and determination going for 2018\u2014completely deserving of the \u201cGood Job, Larry\u201d motivation.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8482626.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.201614, 37.750034], "Date": "Sun Sep 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-29", "Genre": "Genres: HipHop, R&B", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:30 PM", "Venue": "The Grounds at Oakland Coliseum"}, {"Address": "7000 Coliseum Way, Oakland, CA 94621", "Artist": "Lil Uzi Vert", "ArtistBio": "LUV is Rage 2 - OUT NOW https://lnk.to/LuvIsRage2", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8090142.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.201614, 37.750034], "Date": "Sun Sep 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-29", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop, Rap, Hip-hop", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:30 PM", "Venue": "The Grounds at Oakland Coliseum"}, {"Address": "7000 Coliseum Way, Oakland, CA 94621", "Artist": "Curren$y", "ArtistBio": "Curren$y's career flight plan has not come without a few layovers along his burgeoning career.

A prolific composer and prodigious six-string talent, Di Meola has amassed over 20 albums as a leader while collaborating on a dozen or so others with the likes of Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White, John McLaughlin, Paco de Lucia, Jean-Luc Ponty and more. And while his dazzling technique on both acoustic and electric guitars has afforded him regal status among hordes of frettboard aficionados who regularly flock to his concerts, the depth of Di Meola's writing and compositions along with the soulfulness of his guitar expressions, have won him legions of fans worldwide.\n\nA pioneer of blending world music and jazz, going back to early Latin-tinged fusion outings like 1976's Land of the Midnight Sun, 1977's Elegant Gypsy and 1978's Casino, the guitar great has continued to explore the rich influence of flamenco, tango, Middle Eastern, Brazilian and African music throughout his long career.\n\nDi Meola\u2019s most recent release, 2013\u2019s \"All Your Life\", was an acoustic tour de force that had him revisiting the music of a seminal influence \u2013 The Beatles. \u201cI really credit the Beatles for the reason why I play guitar,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a major catalyst for me to want to learn music. So their impact was pretty strong.\u201d A virtual one-man show of virtuosity, it features the guitar great interpreting 14 familiar Beatles tunes in the stripped-down setting of strictly acoustic guitar. All the tracks are imbued with the guitarist\u2019s signature flamenco flourishes, intricate arpeggiating and dazzling cross-picking. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, where the Beatles created most of their records during their heyday, \"All Your Life\" stands as a triumph in the long and illustrious career of a bona fide guitar hero. \u201cI\u2019ve come full circle with this,\u201d says Di Meola. \u201cI started out my life loving the Beatles, and I never stopped, just like a lot of so many other guitarists from my generation. In the middle, we all went into whatever music we pursued in our careers -- fusion, jazz, whatever it might be. We all wanted to further our craft. But when you come back to the Beatles\u2019 music, it\u2019s like; \u201cMan, this stuff is still happening! All of it!\u201d\n\nDi Meola's ongoing fascination with complex rhythmic syncopation combined with provocative lyrical melodies and sophisticated harmony has been at the heart of his music throughout a celebrated career that has earned him critical accolades, three gold albums and more than six million in record sales worldwide. He has been particularly enamored over the past 20 years by the tango music of the late great Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla, whose compositions he has interpreted over time, beginning with 1990's Di Meola Plays Piazzolla, continuing to 1993's Heart of the Immigrants, 2002's Flesh on Flesh and right up to 2007's Diabolic Inventions and Seduction for Solo Guitar.\n\"Piazzolla had a profound effect on my development as a musician and as a person,\u201d says Al. \u201cWe became close friends, often communicating by mail. And during the course of this friendship my admiration and desire to learn more about this great man intensified.\u201d\n\nA native of New Jersey who still resides in the Garden State along with a home in Miami, Di Meola was born in Jersey City on July 22, 1954. Growing up in Bergenfield with the music of Elvis Presley, The Ventures and The Beatles, he naturally gravitated to guitar as a youngster and by his early teens was already an accomplished player. Attaining such impressive skills at such a young age didn't come easy for Al but rather was the result of focused dedication and intensive periods of woodshedding between his junior and senior years in high school. \u201cI used to practice the guitar eight to ten hours a day,\u201d he told DownBeat. \u201cAnd I was trying to find myself, or find the kind of music that suited where I was going with the guitar.\u201d\n\nIn 1971, Al enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and by the second semester began playing in a fusion quartet led by keyboardist Barry Miles. A gig tape of that band was later passed on to Chick Corea by a friend of Al's, and in the early part of 1974 the 19-year-old guitarist was tapped to join the fusion super group as a replacement for guitarist Bill Connors. \u201cI was just sitting around my apartment in Boston on a Friday afternoon when Chick called and asked me to come to a rehearsal in New York,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI couldn't believe it. But in 10 minutes I packed some clothes in a bag, got a ride to New York and never saw that apartment in Boston again.\u201d\n\nFollowing a weekend of rehearsals with Chick, Stanley Clarke and Lenny White, Di Meola made his Return to Forever debut at Carnegie Hall on July 3, 1974, officially launching his career into the stratosphere. \"Playing with Chick in Return To Forever was the first significant step in my development as a player,\u201d says Al. After three landmark recordings with Return To Forever \u2013 1974's Where Have I Known You Before, 1975's Grammy Award winning No Mystery and 1976's Romantic Warrior \u2013 the group disbanded and Al subsequently started up his career as a solo artist.\n\nHis 1976 debut as a leader, Land of the Midnight Sun, was a blazing showcase of his signature chops and Latin-tinged compositions that featured a stellar cast including drummers Steve Gadd and Lenny White, bassist Anthony Jackson and Jaco Pastorius, keyboardists Jan Hammer, Barry Miles and Chick Corea, and percussionist Mingo Lewis. Over the course of six more albums with Columbia Records \u2013 Elegant Gypsy, Casino, Splendido Hotel, Electric Rendezvous, Tour De Force and Scenario \u2013 Al established himself as an influential force in contemporary music.\n\n1980 marked the triumph of the acoustic guitar Trio with Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin. Their debut recording on Columbia Records, Friday Night in San Francisco, became a landmark recording that surpassed the two million mark in sales. The following year, 1981, Di Meola was inducted into Guitar Player\u2019s Gallery of Greats after four consecutive wins as Best Jazz Guitarist in the magazine\u2019s Readers Poll. The three virtuosos in the Trio toured together from 1980 through 1983, releasing the studio album Passion, Grace & Fire in 1982. In 1995, they reunited for a third recording, Guitar Trio, follow by another triumphant world tour. In early 1996, Di Meola formed a new trio with the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and RTF band mate Stanley Clarke called The Rite of Strings. Their self-titled debut was released in 1995. Di Meola subsequently recorded with the likes of opera superstar Luciano Pavarotti, pop stars Paul Simon and Dave Matthews, classical guitarist Manuel Barrueco, Japanese jazz pianist Yutaka Kobayashi and Italian pop star Pino Daniele. Over the course of his career, he has also worked and recorded with Phil Collins, Carlos Santana, Steve Winwood, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Milton Naciemento, Egberto Gismonti, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Jimmy Page, Steve Vai and Frank Zappa.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, Di Meola invited the great Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba to tour with him on some concert appearances which were greeted by fans with great applause.\n\nNow in early 2015 Di Meola is working on recording his newest album titled; ELYSIUM, and will be touring North America and Europe with many dates already booked.\n\nVisit: http://www.aldimeola.com/#!tour/c9a0\n\nAlbum recordings can be found at:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/al-di-meola/id814570\n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/al-di-meola-mn0000600228/discography\n\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Al+Di+Meola/+albums", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8725426.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.285583, 38.29958], "Date": "Sun Sep 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-29", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Jazz Fusion, Jazz Instrument, Fusion, Flamenco", "OtherInfo": "Full Food and Bar Menu Available in all sections PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE - 45 Years On Stage Tour 2019During a 40-plus year career marked by hugely influential recordings and worldwide tours, Di Meola has regenerated the jazz idiom three times over while dedicating himself to his art.

In the middle, we all went into whatever music we pursued in our careers -- fusion, jazz, whatever it might be. We all wanted to further our craft. But when you come back to the Beatles\u2019 music, it\u2019s like; \u201cMan, this stuff is still happening! All of it!\u201d\n\nDi Meola's ongoing fascination with complex rhythmic syncopation combined with provocative lyrical melodies and sophisticated harmony has been at the heart of his music throughout a celebrated career that has earned him critical accolades, three gold albums and more than six million in record sales worldwide. He has been particularly enamored over the past 20 years by the tango music of the late great Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla, whose compositions he has interpreted over time, beginning with 1990's Di Meola Plays Piazzolla, continuing to 1993's Heart of the Immigrants, 2002's Flesh on Flesh and right up to 2007's Diabolic Inventions and Seduction for Solo Guitar.\n\"Piazzolla had a profound effect on my development as a musician and as a person,\u201d says Al. \u201cWe became close friends, often communicating by mail. And during the course of this friendship my admiration and desire to learn more about this great man intensified.\u201d\n\nA native of New Jersey who still resides in the Garden State along with a home in Miami, Di Meola was born in Jersey City on July 22, 1954. Growing up in Bergenfield with the music of Elvis Presley, The Ventures and The Beatles, he naturally gravitated to guitar as a youngster and by his early teens was already an accomplished player. Attaining such impressive skills at such a young age didn't come easy for Al but rather was the result of focused dedication and intensive periods of woodshedding between his junior and senior years in high school. \u201cI used to practice the guitar eight to ten hours a day,\u201d he told DownBeat. \u201cAnd I was trying to find myself, or find the kind of music that suited where I was going with the guitar.\u201d\n\nIn 1971, Al enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and by the second semester began playing in a fusion quartet led by keyboardist Barry Miles. A gig tape of that band was later passed on to Chick Corea by a friend of Al's, and in the early part of 1974 the 19-year-old guitarist was tapped to join the fusion super group as a replacement for guitarist Bill Connors. \u201cI was just sitting around my apartment in Boston on a Friday afternoon when Chick called and asked me to come to a rehearsal in New York,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI couldn't believe it. But in 10 minutes I packed some clothes in a bag, got a ride to New York and never saw that apartment in Boston again.\u201d\n\nFollowing a weekend of rehearsals with Chick, Stanley Clarke and Lenny White, Di Meola made his Return to Forever debut at Carnegie Hall on July 3, 1974, officially launching his career into the stratosphere. \"Playing with Chick in Return To Forever was the first significant step in my development as a player,\u201d says Al. After three landmark recordings with Return To Forever \u2013 1974's Where Have I Known You Before, 1975's Grammy Award winning No Mystery and 1976's Romantic Warrior \u2013 the group disbanded and Al subsequently started up his career as a solo artist.\n\nHis 1976 debut as a leader, Land of the Midnight Sun, was a blazing showcase of his signature chops and Latin-tinged compositions that featured a stellar cast including drummers Steve Gadd and Lenny White, bassist Anthony Jackson and Jaco Pastorius, keyboardists Jan Hammer, Barry Miles and Chick Corea, and percussionist Mingo Lewis. Over the course of six more albums with Columbia Records \u2013 Elegant Gypsy, Casino, Splendido Hotel, Electric Rendezvous, Tour De Force and Scenario \u2013 Al established himself as an influential force in contemporary music.\n\n1980 marked the triumph of the acoustic guitar Trio with Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin. Their debut recording on Columbia Records, Friday Night in San Francisco, became a landmark recording that surpassed the two million mark in sales. The following year, 1981, Di Meola was inducted into Guitar Player\u2019s Gallery of Greats after four consecutive wins as Best Jazz Guitarist in the magazine\u2019s Readers Poll. The three virtuosos in the Trio toured together from 1980 through 1983, releasing the studio album Passion, Grace & Fire in 1982. In 1995, they reunited for a third recording, Guitar Trio, follow by another triumphant world tour. In early 1996, Di Meola formed a new trio with the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and RTF band mate Stanley Clarke called The Rite of Strings. Their self-titled debut was released in 1995. Di Meola subsequently recorded with the likes of opera superstar Luciano Pavarotti, pop stars Paul Simon and Dave Matthews, classical guitarist Manuel Barrueco, Japanese jazz pianist Yutaka Kobayashi and Italian pop star Pino Daniele. Over the course of his career, he has also worked and recorded with Phil Collins, Carlos Santana, Steve Winwood, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Milton Naciemento, Egberto Gismonti, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Jimmy Page, Steve Vai and Frank Zappa.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, Di Meola invited the great Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba to tour with him on some concert appearances which were greeted by fans with great applause.\n\nNow in early 2015 Di Meola is working on recording his newest album titled; ELYSIUM, and will be touring North America and Europe with many dates already booked.\n\nVisit: http://www.aldimeola.com/#!tour/c9a0\n\nAlbum recordings can be found at:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/al-di-meola/id814570\n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/al-di-meola-mn0000600228/discography\n\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Al+Di+Meola/+albums", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Sun Sep 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "Chester Thompson Trio One of the most revered Hammond organists alive, Chester Thompson has led a charmed musical life \u2013 writing, recording and performing for four decades with two of the legendary bands to emerge in the 1960s and 1970s, Tower of Power and Santana.

In their obsession, the pair became accomplished players and soon began writing originals; a process which came naturally to both of them. In 2008, they were joined by Liam Gough (drums) and Brendon Love (bass) to form The Teskey Brothers. The group spent the next eight years cutting their teeth in city-fringe pubs and backyard party jams, honing the old-school Motown soul sound and working it into something of their own. Finally in 2017 The Teskey Brothers released their debut album Half Mile Harvest. The record, self-produced at their home studio in Warrandyte, captures the essence of old school soul that the four have grown to love and know over years of musical friendship. The songs are beautifully written, showcasing the musicianship at hand and dripping with warm melodious hooks as natural and alive as anything that came out of Stax-era Memphis.

Along the way, stories were turned into songs, forming 'Eva and the Vagabond Tales'. The Vagabond Tales is a multi instrumental music project that is centered around the songwriting of Eva Mikhailovna. The songs combine western, old folk, and ragtime into a musical melting pot, creating an alluring sound that \"transcends time and continents.\" Since the start of the project in 2011, Mikhailovna released a full length album entitled \"Letters From the Moon\" in the fall of 2013, and an EP in 2016, titled \"La Douleur Exquise\". The music project has been interviewed on NPR radio shows, featured numerous times on NPR's variety show American Parlor Songbook, and played on stations across the west coast. Along with her musicians, Mikhailovna appeared on LATV's the Zoo in 2016. In 2017, Eva and the Vagabond Tales were nominated for the best outdoor video for \"Desks in the Wild\" during NPR's Tiny Desk submissions. Mikhailovna has also teamed up with artists such as Lonesome Wyatt and the Holy Spooks, singing on his 2017 album, \"Grim Weepers\". More recently, Mikhailovna has teamed up with music producer Charles Newman of New York City's Mother West to record and produce the Vagabond Tales' next album. The music has often been described as nostalgic and close to the heart, and the songs are known for their melancholy, \"feel of old Europe\"- David Fleming, NPR.\n\nBorn to a musical family in Russia, lead singer and song writer Eva Mikhailovna began writing songs and lyrics at a young age. \"Music has been part of Mikhailovna\u2019s life for as long as she can remember \u2014 her first musical memory is hearing a piece of classical music and walking to the piano where her aunt was playing it. She learned how to play the piano before she could read or write\u2026. the whole family would play folk music and sing when they would come together for meals.\" (Vanessa Franko, Press Enterprise) While growing up in California, Mikhailovna would sit at the piano for hours and write out ideas for melodies that she thought could fit in with films she's seen. Wanting to create music for herself that was honest and simple, Mikhailovna started completing songs and adding her own old poems to them. The music was never intended to reach other people's ears, but rather to therapeutically express feelings and emotions that had no words attached to them. After an invitation to play some of her music at a local college, Mikhailovna put together a small band and along with help from friends, arrangements to songs were completed and ready to be performed live. After encouragement from friends, relatives and help from musicians that she looked up to, Mikhailovna arranged a series of songs to be released as the album \"Letters From the Moon\". The entire album was recorded by Mikhalovna in a 1920's back house. A local newspaper mentioned the unique packaging of the album, which was printed on envelopes, suiting the theme of the album's title. A later article said the album contained the \"best unconventional percussion,\" with Mikhailovna tap dancing on one of the tracks. For a few years after the first album's release, Mikhailovna played with a band, calling themselves \"Eva and the Vagabonds.\" Together, the band worked on arranging an appropriate set of songs for the La Douleur Exquise EP. With the Vagabonds already being notorious for their \"sad, melancholy songs,\" \"train beat,\" and using what they have to get their ideas done, the EP was completed and released in February of 2016.\n\nThroughout the existence of Eva and the Vagabond Tales, many people have expressed gratitude for music that people can relate to. \"It is often the hardest music to express on a daily basis, and not too many people want to feel these emotions or connect with that part of themselves, but when they do want to, it is incredibly important that [this kind of music] is available to them.\"- Eva Mikhailovna.\n\nDuring live performances, Mikhailovna is accompanied by a group of musicians whom are known as the \"Vagabonds\". The Vagabonds consist of accordion, bass, percussion, trumpets, violins, piano, and other various instruments, although more commonly the band can be found playing as a four piece group.

Along the way, stories were turned into songs, forming 'Eva and the Vagabond Tales'. The Vagabond Tales is a multi instrumental music project that is centered around the songwriting of Eva Mikhailovna. The songs combine western, old folk, and ragtime into a musical melting pot, creating an alluring sound that \"transcends time and continents.\" Since the start of the project in 2011, Mikhailovna released a full length album entitled \"Letters From the Moon\" in the fall of 2013, and an EP in 2016, titled \"La Douleur Exquise\". The music project has been interviewed on NPR radio shows, featured numerous times on NPR's variety show American Parlor Songbook, and played on stations across the west coast. Along with her musicians, Mikhailovna appeared on LATV's the Zoo in 2016. In 2017, Eva and the Vagabond Tales were nominated for the best outdoor video for \"Desks in the Wild\" during NPR's Tiny Desk submissions. Mikhailovna has also teamed up with artists such as Lonesome Wyatt and the Holy Spooks, singing on his 2017 album, \"Grim Weepers\". More recently, Mikhailovna has teamed up with music producer Charles Newman of New York City's Mother West to record and produce the Vagabond Tales' next album. The music has often been described as nostalgic and close to the heart, and the songs are known for their melancholy, \"feel of old Europe\"- David Fleming, NPR.\n\nBorn to a musical family in Russia, lead singer and song writer Eva Mikhailovna began writing songs and lyrics at a young age. \"Music has been part of Mikhailovna\u2019s life for as long as she can remember \u2014 her first musical memory is hearing a piece of classical music and walking to the piano where her aunt was playing it. She learned how to play the piano before she could read or write\u2026. the whole family would play folk music and sing when they would come together for meals.\" (Vanessa Franko, Press Enterprise) While growing up in California, Mikhailovna would sit at the piano for hours and write out ideas for melodies that she thought could fit in with films she's seen. Wanting to create music for herself that was honest and simple, Mikhailovna started completing songs and adding her own old poems to them. The music was never intended to reach other people's ears, but rather to therapeutically express feelings and emotions that had no words attached to them. After an invitation to play some of her music at a local college, Mikhailovna put together a small band and along with help from friends, arrangements to songs were completed and ready to be performed live. After encouragement from friends, relatives and help from musicians that she looked up to, Mikhailovna arranged a series of songs to be released as the album \"Letters From the Moon\". The entire album was recorded by Mikhalovna in a 1920's back house. A local newspaper mentioned the unique packaging of the album, which was printed on envelopes, suiting the theme of the album's title. A later article said the album contained the \"best unconventional percussion,\" with Mikhailovna tap dancing on one of the tracks. For a few years after the first album's release, Mikhailovna played with a band, calling themselves \"Eva and the Vagabonds.\" Together, the band worked on arranging an appropriate set of songs for the La Douleur Exquise EP. With the Vagabonds already being notorious for their \"sad, melancholy songs,\" \"train beat,\" and using what they have to get their ideas done, the EP was completed and released in February of 2016.\n\nThroughout the existence of Eva and the Vagabond Tales, many people have expressed gratitude for music that people can relate to. \"It is often the hardest music to express on a daily basis, and not too many people want to feel these emotions or connect with that part of themselves, but when they do want to, it is incredibly important that [this kind of music] is available to them.\"- Eva Mikhailovna.\n\nDuring live performances, Mikhailovna is accompanied by a group of musicians whom are known as the \"Vagabonds\". The Vagabonds consist of accordion, bass, percussion, trumpets, violins, piano, and other various instruments, although more commonly the band can be found playing as a four piece group. Currently, Mikhailovna is accompanied by long time members Alan Arteaga, Jasmine Capitulo (accordion) and Jacob Pflum (percussion). The band continues building it's sound from the foundations of old time music and melancholy story-telling, bending the laws of traditional songwriting and sound. \"The main intriguing factor about The Vagabond Tales is the inexplicit chameleon effect of ageless mood,\u201d writes Independent Feedback Blog.

And that\u2019s OK. But it takes courage to turn that anger into productive energy. The previous Sinkane album, 2017's Life and Livin' It, was released at a very crazy time: things like the Muslim ban, police shooting unarmed people of color, massive corruption in my native Sudan, fake news, Donald Trump, Brexit and so many other calamities all really forced me to think about my place in the world as a musician. I began to think about how I could use my music in a constructive way \u2014 not only to help myself but to help others who feel frustrated and powerless.\n\nI\u2019m not a newbie to hate: I\u2019m black, Muslim and even though I'm an American I'm often made to feel like a foreigner in my own country. And sometimes I do feel like a foreigner \u2014 in fact, I once made a whole album, 2012's Mars, about that feeling. I\u2019ve made a lot of music out of my life story but I\u2019ve always kept things vague enough that anyone listening to my music could relate to it on their own terms. And yet I have to admit that I never truly felt satisfied with that. I eventually realized that, in order to truly connect with other people, I first needed to connect with myself on a deeper level than before.\n\nThroughout the making of my new album I kept asking myself the same question: \u201cAs an immigrant to America, where do I belong?\u201d So, during the writing process, I worked mainly by myself so that I could ensure the most honest and personal answers to that question. I read books by Joseph Campbell, the late novelist/cultural theorist Daniel Quinn, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Pakistani novelist Mohsin Hamid, and the late African-American memoirist Philippe Wamba, hoping they\u2019d guide me to some kind of answer. Then, one day when I was wandering around the fertile desert of the internet, I stumbled upon an amazing word: d\u00e9pays\u00e9.\n\nD\u00e9pays\u00e9 is a French word that basically means \u201cto be removed from one\u2019s habitual surroundings.\u201d By extension, it means to be disoriented, homeless. That's a feeling I relate to very much in these times \u2014 and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one who feels this way. That word gave me clarity and made the journey inward that much more exciting.\n\nAfter I finished writing the album I brought the music to my band. Sinkane is an American band comprised of people from all over the world: I am Sudanese, guitarist Jonny Lam is Chinese, keyboardist Elenna Canlas is Filipina, drummer Chris St. Hilaire is Trinidadian, and bassist Michael \u201cIsh\u201d Montgomery is Black American. Our collective experience as children of the diaspora helped bring the music to life in the most honest way possible.\n\nSo here we are. D\u00e9pays\u00e9 is the story of an immigrant\u2019s journey of self-discovery in the Trump era. The music is loud and raw, and it's bursting with energy unlike anything I\u2019ve ever done before. It starts with a call to arms: \u201cEverybody,\u201d a rock & roll song in the spirit of Sly Stone and funky early-'70s Afro-rock bands like the Funkees and the Hygrades. Every day we wake up to another horror story about racism, and it\u2019s left many of us angry, confused and frustrated. But we can change the news for the better. We can show people that a multicolored world is a beautiful one. Celebrating our differences yields beauty in life. And that takes... everybody.\n\nThe second song of the album, the desert blues/dancehall-tinged \u201cEveryone,\u201d continues that line of thought to its logical conclusion: love is the key to helping us understand one another.\n\nThe psychedelic, groovy East African-inspired title track came to me in a dream: I dreamed I was walking the streets of Omdurman at night, a city along the Nile in my native Sudan, when I heard someone playing guitar and singing in Arabic. It turned out to be my father! He was sitting cross-legged on the ground, under a streetlight in front of my childhood home. His voice sounded hypnotic, raw and powerful as he sang: \u201cI am your life/And all of our lives/From within the city until our uprising/Our days have left us in the city and, with our imagination, we move forward.\u201d He sang that over and over, and I sing those same words in my song. This, along with the rest of D\u00e9pays\u00e9, has given me peace. I am no longer afraid of the unknown. I\u2019m no longer confused about my duality of my Sudanese and American identities. Now I accept it. And it's made me feel new.\n\n\u201cYa Sudan\u201d and \u201cThe Searching\u201d explore that duality. In \u201cYa Sudan\u201d I pay homage to my country of origin and in \u201cThe Searching\u201d I discuss what it means to move forward from that. Truly understanding one's duality means seeing beyond where you came from: let go of any definition that others put on you and then you can truly see the beauty of your life experience. \u201cStranger\u201d and \u201cBe Here Now\u201d address one of the most confusing aspects in the diaspora experience: religion. Lots of people have questions about their faith: What does this all mean? After all this work why do I still feel uncertain? What about all the bad people who are like me? And the good who are not? Those questions loom larger when you grow up with people different from you. I wanted to bring this up and let people like me know that they\u2019re not alone in questioning their faith. I also thought it would be funny to spitefully ask God to take accountability for his actions. The Arabic lyrics translate to \u201cOh God, aren\u2019t you our protector? Help me through these murky waters that seem part of your master plan.\u201d\n\nAs always, I'm inspired by Sly Stone, Fela Kuti, George Clinton and Bob Marley, as well as the beautiful music of east Africa (especially the Dur Dur Band from Somalia, Mulatu Astatkefrom Ethiopia, and Mohammed Wardi from Sudan). These people all spoke their minds confidently in front of a beat that made you dance. They welcomed every kind of person into their worlds with open arms. We live in an often terrible time but that shouldn\u2019t silence our desire to have a good time. To dance. To dream. To love. To be one with the world. To realize that we\u2019re not alone.\n\nI want Sudanese kids to see a person like them as a positive role model in the arts. I want Sudanese people, all over the world, to know that the world accepts us even when our own leaders, such as Omar El-Bashir or Donald Trump, do not. And ultimately, I want to make it clear that the world is a better place because of our differences. We\u2019re all strangers in this ever-stranger land of America. We are all the American Dream. D\u00e9pays\u00e9 is a place we can all know as home, with elements of all our homes. It's an act of imaginary cartography \u2014 on Mars, I called that place \u201cCaparundi,\u201d a place where Africa, North America, South America, Asia, and the Caribbean all meet in joyous harmony. The music is playing there all night long. Come in and dance and sing. And stay for the conversation.\n\nSincerely,\nAhmed Gallab", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8712679.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.073641, 37.05269], "Date": "Sun Sep 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-29", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Funk, African, Reggae, soul, Psychedelic Rock, Jazz", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Felton Music Hall"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Don Broco", "ArtistBio": "www.donbroco.com", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8983098.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Sun Sep 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-29", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Post Hardcore, Punk", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "SLEEP ON IT", "ArtistBio": "Chicago has been the birthplace of many great bands \u2013 and Sleep On It are a very worthy addition to that lineage. Yet the five-piece almost didn\u2019t happen. The seed was planted at Riot Fest in 2012, when guitarist/vocalist TJ Horansky met guitarist/vocalist Jake Marquis by chance. With bassist AJ Khah and drummer Luka Fischman in tow, the band began rehearsing and writing in Logan Square and released a couple of EPs with their original vocalist, John Cass. However, it was when Zech Pluister replaced Cass in 2016 that everything truly fell into line. \u201cWhen our original vocalist left, I didn't know if we would continue as a band,\" remembers Horansky. \"Once I knew Zech was available though, I wanted him to join Sleep On It.\u201d\n\nThe five-piece has been carefully crafting and honing their identity ever since. The culmination of that is the band\u2019s debut album, Overexposed. As much as these 12 songs fit the pop-punk mold, they also subvert them, elevating this record to something that sits outside the usual confines of genre. \u201cTo me,\u201d explains Horansky, \u201cOverexposed is about being vulnerable and all of the anxieties that come with that. It\u2019s also very liberating.\u201d The band has been busy building a fanbase while sharing the stage with bands such as State Champs, AS IT IS, Waterparks and Four Year Strong, as well as appearances at Riot Fest, Slam Dunk Festival and a run on the final Vans Warped Tour.

Throughout his life, Broussard has been tapped as a talent to watch.\n\n\n\nMarc\u2019s song \u201cHome\u201d was successful at radio and catapulted him onto the national touring stage. His music has been placed in many TV shows and movies. The timeless, soulful nature of Marc\u2019s vocal lends well to Film and TV, and will continue to do so for years to come.\n\n\n\nMost recently, Marc released an independent Christmas Album titled, \u201cMagnolias & Mistletoe\u201d. The original song, \u201cAlmost Christmas\u201d received radio play word wide. Marc\u2019s next project is a charitable rhythm and blues covers record to be released summer 2016. He will be donating fifty percent of the proceeds to City of Refuge.

Over the last decade, Pokey has won the hearts of music lovers across the globe with his creative mix of early jazz, string ragtime, country blues and western swing. After signing with Jack White\u2019s Third Man Records to release his fifth full-length album (Pokey LaFarge) in 2013, he performed as a musical guest on The Late Show with David Letterman and The Late Late Show on Ireland's RT\u00c9 One network. Pokey's rendition of \"Lovesick Blues\" with Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks, featured on an episode of Boardwalk Empire, was selected for inclusion on the series' official soundtrack (Vol. 2). Additionally, Pokey appeared in Disney\u2019s The Lone Ranger (both on screen and on the original score), was featured on A Prairie Home Companion and NPR's World Cafe, and recorded a song for ATO Records' Divided & United: Songs of the Civil War, produced by Randall Poster.\n\n\n\n2014 has been Pokey\u2019s most momentous year yet; by spring, he had brought his music to five continents, with international tours in India, Australia and New Zealand. In the past year, Pokey's tour trail (consisting of over 250 shows) included appearances at clubs and festivals across the USA and Canada as well as two extensive tours in Europe. Pokey has played with the likes of Jack White, The Raconteurs, Wanda Jackson, Old Crow Medicine Show, and most recently, Carolina Chocolate Drops. As an opening act on Jack White's Blunderbuss tour, he delighted sold out crowds at Red Rocks Amphitheater and Radio City Music Hall, among other notable venues in North America. Pokey is currently touring with a five-piece backing band, including his original bandmates (Ryan Koenig on harmonica, washboard and snare, Adam Hoskins on guitar and Joey Glynn on upright bass), in addition to Chloe Feoranzo on clarinet and TJ Muller on cornet.\n\n\n\nAt only 31 years old, Pokey\u2019s career has not slowed in momentum since it began with his first release Marmalade (2007). Shortly followed by Beat, Move and Shake (2008) and Riverboat Soul (2010), Pokey quickly graduated from breakthrough artist to leading musical figure, receiving two consecutive Independent Music Awards for Best Americana Album (Riverboat Soul and Middle of Everywhere).\n\n\n\nPokey\u2019s music transcends the confines of genre, continually challenging the notion that tradition-bearers fail to push musical boundaries. Rather than merely conjuring up half-forgotten imagery of days past, Pokey is a lyrical storyteller, the plot delivered smoothly through his dynamic vocals. Both on stage and off, his effortless wit never fails to charm audiences, giving way to a live music experience that manages to be grandiose and unassuming all at once. Born in the heartland of America and based in St. Louis, Missouri, Pokey\u2019s Midwestern charisma welcomes his audiences with open arms.\n\n\n\nPokey LaFarge is on a mission, encouraging fans worldwide to think differently about what it means to celebrate musical traditions. Simply put, Pokey explains, \u201cIt\u2019s not retro music. It\u2019s American music that never died.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7645726.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2729, 37.8708], "Date": "Sun Sep 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-29", "Genre": "Genres: Country, Country Blues, Blues, Early Jazz, Americana, American Roots Music, American Roots", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage (SOLO)"}, {"Address": "100 Yacht Club Dr, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "Twanguero", "ArtistBio": "Spanish Latin Grammy\u00ae Winner, songwriter/guitar bender TWANGUERO is one of the most active artists in the hispanic scene.

The video was featured in several film festivals including Sacramento Horror Film Festival and Cinekink.

Her music is always lyrically based with a strong foundation of passionate songwriting, while the timbres vary depending on the performance.

In March 2017 she released \"They've Done Studies\" followed by a multi-media dramatic live production at DNA Lounge called \"Studies Have Shown.\" She toured the production throughout the U.S. in the summer of 2017 and will be releasing a concert film of the show in 2018.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7617721.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.407929, 37.763394], "Date": "Sun Sep 29 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-29", "Genre": "Genres: Comedy, Singer, Songwriter, Political, Alternative, Experimental Pop Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Verdi Club"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Forest Sun", "ArtistBio": "With over 50 million plays on Pandora, troubadour and award-winning songwriter, Forest Sun, enlivens audiences around the globe with his wealth of songs and stories, all sung and told in a laid-back California style.

They learned to communicate, and later became half-formed, fundamentally decent kids, using music to pass the time and process life in an honest way. Then, Dan moved away, forcing them to send unfinished tracks back and forth, as if working on the same love letter. They released their debut, Growl Pop, in Feb. 2017, and thanks to some fans on youtube, earned a million plays on Spotify within the first 6 months. As an unsigned band, they were nonetheless praised by outlets like LA Record and Wild Honey Pie for their gummy, sticky bass lines underpinning an elastic vocal, alternately agile and throaty rich. Best exemplified by songs like Lester, their music is jangling acoustics over an 808 thump, where there are inside jokes told in outside voices. They do it to amuse themselves.

Originally from West Marin County, he made his way down the California coast through Santa Cruz, writing songs, jamming in garages and performing at every open mic he could find while simultaneously earning a BA in Film & Digital Media and Literature from the University of California Santa Cruz.\n\nHe then immediately moved to Los Angeles where he wrote and arranged his acoustic-laced debut studio album, Californicana. The album was produced by LA producer Marc Danzeisen (Riverdogs, Powerslide, Gilby Clarke), and features saxophonist Jeremy Trezona (Saint Motel), as well as guitarists Johnny Hawthorn (Toad The Wet Sprocket, Everclear) and Manny Alvarez (Jackson Browne, Lucinda Williams), among others. It released independently under Bourne\u2019s own Robotic Records with a successful sold out record release show at the historic (and now permanently closed) House of Blues on the Sunset Strip Foundation Room, followed by a 15-date California Tour.\n\nOn his 2015 debut, Frankie took a stance as a solo artist and emerged on the scene equipped with infectious roots-rock songs, and an authentic indie sound that, \"combines the style of new Americana with all the things you loved about 90s adult alternative bands\" (TourWorthy.com), and \"a smoky, quick-tongued lyrical quality that can change speeds like a Zack Greinke change-up\" (San Jose Rock Music Examiner). His first solo effort has been incredibly well-received by Indie, Rock and Americana radio stations nationwide, and won an award for best love song on the Jango Radio 2015 Valentine's Day Playlist, who call it, \"a refreshing roots rock record for the 21st Century\".\n\nAfter a hard-fought six years in the Los Angeles music scene, Frankie returned to his native San Francisco Bay Area in 2016, where his new band has quickly begun to make a name for themselves in the North Bay for their explosive, jam-oriented live shows, and their melodic roots-rock music that bridges eras of influence. Featuring drummer Jeff Nassi (Meredith Brooks, Fillmore Slim, Unauthorized Rolling Stones), guitarist Sunil Sharma (Alison Harris, Reality Check, Blusion), and bassist Matt Pasquale (Gravity Hill), Bourne\u2019s new band is his primary focus of late. They enter Prairie Sun Studios in Spring 2018 to cut an album under Robotic Records.\n\nOn February 17th 2017 Frankie released Valley of Vindication, a 5-track EP of songs that showcase a softer, more acoustic direction to his sound. On Record Store Day 2017 (April 22nd 2017) Frankie released another 3-track EP, titled Homemade Remedies.\n\nYou can find his music on iTunes, Spotify, Amazon and CD Baby, and hear it on the following terrestrial and internet radio stations: KSVY (Sonoma), KWMR (Marin), KRSH (Santa Rosa), KALW (San Francisco), KPIG & KZSC (Santa Cruz), KCBX (Central Coast), HFM LA (Los Angeles), KHLV (Las Vegas), KHTP (Phoenix), Jango Radio, Indie Radio Music, Relax Free Radio, The Mad Music Asylum, War Stories Radio, and UK based XRP Radio, among others.\n\nwww.frankiebourne.com\n\n\u201cTroubadour Frankie Bourne is one to watch as a burgeoning solo act.

He also knows just about everything about throwing the perfect curveball in baseball. A master on the mound in the major leagues for years, Zito had a virtually unstoppable curve that often proved unbeatable and earned him the coveted Cy Young Award right out of the gate at age twenty-four. A studied and disciplined scholar at whatever art he\u2019s attempting to master, the world class athlete is now throwing that heat in a new direction \u2013 his music. And with the release of his debut EP, NO SECRETS, he\u2019s ready to reveal an entirely new side of himself to the world \u2013 one that might surprise people who know him only for his pitching prowess and roller coaster career.\n\n\n\nZito has actually been playing guitar since his early 20\u2019s, while on the road in the minor leagues, and he began dabbling in songwriting for fun a few years later. Born with a natural athletic ability, he\u2019s also always possessed a love and talent for music that he comes by quite naturally. Zito grew up in a household surrounded by music. His father Joe worked as a conductor/arranger for Nat King Cole and eventually an artist manager, and his mother Roberta had been one of Cole\u2019s backup singers in the Merry Young Souls. Barry recalls having a fascination with music pretty early on.\n\n\n\nAfter retiring from his baseball career in 2015, Zito immediately turned his full attention to that second love and began crafting the songs that would fill his first album. You could almost say it was fate or kismet that brought the World Series winner full circle to a Triple A team in Music City right before he retired, and for Zito, it was definitely a long, winding journey full of interesting twists and turns that landed him there and ultimately inspired the songs on NO SECRETS.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore baseball became a constant focus, Dad always had different instruments in the house, and I remember when I was five playing a valve trombone and trying to match the notes to the Michael Jackson song I was hearing, so I think I had an ear for it. I was raised in more of the Jazz and R&B worlds since my dad was a Jazz conductor and arranger. He was actually self- taught -- he didn\u2019t go to school past the eighth grade and was from the Bronx. My mom was a classically trained singer who at 19 was singing with Nat, and my dad was conducting for Nat when they met. I remember growing up listening to a lot of Gino Vanilli, I was raised on his record, and a record called Time and Tide, by an artist named Basia. These are the sounds my dad loved and that I listened to, but if I had to pick one I would say Stevie Wonder is my greatest influence.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe family moved to San Diego when Zito was six so his mother could work with the metaphysical church his grandmother created, leaving his dad with plenty of time to devote to Barry\u2019s pitching endeavors. It became apparent early on to Mr. Zito that his son had a gift that could take him far. \u201cI was able to throw this uncanny curveball at seven or eight, and I was much taller than everyone else,\u201d recalls Zito. \u201dAnd my dad knew in baseball they send scouts around the world to find talent. Dad always said, \u2018if you master three pitches, they\u2019ll come and find you.\u2019 So from then on, I worked year round doing baseball.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt twenty-one Zito became a first-round pick and landed a contract with the Oakland A\u2019s, and within a year was pitching in the majors. By his third year, he boasted a sparkling 23-5 record and was given the Cy Young Award as the American League\u2019s best pitcher. A few years later in 2006 he made history by signing the richest contract ever for a pitcher at the time, with the San Francisco Giants, and subsequently launched one of the most confounding and frustrating chapters in his life\u2019s story. Rich beyond his wildest dreams, his confidence and performance wavered, and Zito began to realize he wasn\u2019t like all the other players.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the years of my career progressed I realized I was raised by musicians -- creative, sensitive, beautiful people, and there\u2019s not a lot of room in professional sports for sensitive vulnerable anything really. It was a real struggle for me to embrace my differences and be authentically who I was. It probably wasn\u2019t until the last few years of my career that I was able to do that. That\u2019s why I really love being a musician now, because it is who I feel I have always been at my core.\u201d\n\n\n\nLiving in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills with money, looks, fame, and everything else one could want, Zito not only began to lose his golden arm for a bit as his performance plummeted at times, he began to lose himself as well. Fans were brutal when he repeatedly failed to deliver consistent greatness, and at the point when he should have been happiest, he was at his lowest. There were trials and tribulations to follow, both personal and professional, and through it all Barry was led to become a Christian, and his whole life changed.\n\n\n\nThrough all of the vast changes in his life, Barry\u2019s move to Nashville, TN would prove to be one of the most influential. He not only discovered a renewed love for the game during his year with the Nashville Sounds, he also found time to focus on his songwriting. After talking about his musical aspirations in an interview with The Tennessean newspaper, an ASCAP rep contacted him and within months Barry began collaborating with some Nashville songwriters. He devoured songwriting books during his final summer in the locker room, and at the end of the season announced his retirement from baseball. Less than a year into his songwriting career, Barry threw all of his passion behind his music, heading into the studio and recording the collection of autobiographically-tinged tunes that would become his debut EP. For Zito, the project released years of pent-up emotions and feelings that had no place in baseball, but still had to be expressed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going at my music probably with more ferocity than I even did with baseball, because I\u2019ve been waiting for years to work on music full time. Every day is like a dream doing this... I\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve been consistently probably since 2002, my Cy Young year.\u201d\n\n\n\nSongs on the new project like \u201cSecret To Life\u201d peel back the curtain and give listeners a unique glimpse into Zito no one has ever seen before. The profoundly personal tune illustrates his firsthand experience with how money, fame and celebrity aren\u2019t really the gateway to fulfillment. The EP\u2019s songs definitely draw on universally relatable themes, as in \u201cWrong,\u201d a tune that addresses the habit we all have of telling ourselves things that we know aren\u2019t true, but that we can\u2019t seem to be totally honest and come clean about.\n\n\n\n\u201cUndiscovered You,\u201d inspired by Zito\u2019s wife Amber, speaks to the way a woman possesses a special, hidden side she reveals only to her partner. \u201cThere\u2019s always that part of a woman that she keeps hidden, that only one person gets to see. And what an honor it is as a spouse or boyfriend to get to see that,\u201d says Zito. \u201cMy wife has her side like that, and she was a big inspiration for this song. I know this amazing, intimate side to her that nobody else gets to know and that\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe album narrates Zito\u2019s journey through life as someone who has experienced life\u2019s pinnacles and its pitfalls and come out the other side a better man. On tunes like \u201cMy Own Path\u201d he opens up fully about demons he\u2019s faced head on and conquered and the challenges in embracing your own path in the midst of adversity and despair. The anchor of this intimate collection may well be \u201cHome\u201d though, a song penned about his Christian faith that encapsulates the arduous journey he\u2019s taken and how it ultimately led him right back to faith in God and himself. Penned during a particularly tough time in his baseball career, the song perfectly captures the angst and longing we all feel just trying to find our place in the world and how, in the end, we find we already possessed everything we were seeking deep inside ourselves.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wrote that song two months before I got saved,\u201d recalls Zito, \u201cand I was just in a nightmarish place in my life. It\u2019s more of a story song, and it starts off with \u2018I\u2019ve been walking this road for so long, can\u2019t see where I\u2019m going, forgot where I\u2019m from\u2019. And then I make it very personal talking about how as a little boy my dad always told me to dream big and dream always -- that was a catchphrase of my father\u2019s. It talks about how I worked hard and saw the money and fame and all those good things, but then the demons of pride were there waiting too. In the end the song describes how I realized I never really left home.

Gone are the days of reliance on formal singles and/or albums, and in their place waits a space of creative freedom for artists. Ilan Rubin never fit traditional molds anyway. Despite the energy and enjoyment of playing with artists like Nine Inch Nails, Angels & Airwaves, and Paramore, Rubin felt the urge to do more and was always at work creating his own music, his own sound, his own vision \u2013 The New Regime.\n\n\n\nBeginning in 2007, he spent every spare moment writing, arranging and performing his own songs. Every instrument, every note of The New Regime is played and/or sung by him. With two albums under his belt \u2013 Coup and Speak Through the White Noise \u2013 Rubin decided to take a different approach with his most recent crop of creative outpouring.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen it came time for a third release, I had enough material for almost two full-lengths. But, unlike my first two albums, these songs weren\u2019t written with a definitive vision in mind. I realized that this broader spectrum of ideas was an exciting thing \u2013 I could release the music as a series of EPs. I call them \u2018Exhibits\u2019 \u2013 a collection that I can and will constantly be adding to.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe first in the series - Exhibit A - is an exploration of dynamics. Its eight songs are a mix of organic sounds and electronics. \u201c\u2019This is a New World\u2019 is a song that sticks out to me,\u201d says Rubin, \u201cbecause it just about covers the sonic extremes of the EP in one song. With Exhibit A, I wanted to continue to push my songwriting in multiple directions, while keeping songs direct and concise. I think \u2018Daydream\u2019, the featured track from Exhibit A, is a good example of what I\u2019d like listeners to experience with this music. A lot of people like to tell stories with their lyrics. What I\u2019ve really enjoyed doing is trying to set scenes for those stories; to let people take their own journey along with the songs.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6166191.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.410073, 37.782687], "Date": "Mon Sep 30 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-30", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Alternative Rock", "OtherInfo": "THE NEW REGIME SUPPORTING ANGELS & AIRWAVES", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield"}, {"Address": "982 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Charming Liars", "ArtistBio": "Twitter: https://twitter.com/charmingliars\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/charmingliarsmusic\nWebsite: http://www.charmingliars.com\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/charmingliarsmusic", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8353109.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.410073, 37.782687], "Date": "Mon Sep 30 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-30", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Austin de Lone", "ArtistBio": "Twitter: https://twitter.com/charmingliars\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/charmingliarsmusic\nWebsite: http://www.charmingliars.com\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/charmingliarsmusic", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Mon Sep 30 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "Open Mic Night with Austin DeLone", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall"}, {"Address": "982 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Angels & Airwaves", "ArtistBio": "www.AngelsAndAirwaves.com", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9103027.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.410073, 37.782687], "Date": "Mon Sep 30 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-30", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield"}, {"Address": "711 Silver Lake Dr, Danville, CA 94526", "Artist": "Dan Ashley", "ArtistBio": "Dan Ashley has been around music and passionate about music his entire life, starting as a child with his first guitar and piano lessons and then singing in the junior choir at his church in North Carolina.

After the phenomenal online break-out success of 2015\u2019s reverberant beauty \u2018Nothing\u2019s Gonna Hurt You Baby\u2019 from the early Cigarettes EP (\u2018I.\u2019) from 2012, the Brooklyn transplant (originally from El Paso) wanted to project his worldview on to a bigger screen, a broader canvas. As Greg explains, \u201cThis is like the novel or feature-length version of Cigarettes. I wanted it to feel like a complete work, where some of the imagery repeats \u2013 like it\u2019s all in the same world. It\u2019s very much a fulfilment of the feelings in the short works.\u201d\n\nThat sense of fulfilment is richly felt on Cigarettes After Sex, which unspools like the most achingly romantic of movies: immersive, cohesive and transporting. Swooning in the spirit of influences such as Mazzy Star and Red House Painters, its sumptuous songs of love elevate Cigarettes to the ranks of those acts who create worlds of their own, exciting the most devoted kind of following \u2013 for Gonzalez, The Smiths were a reference point.\n\nRight from the off, Gonzalez\u2019s ability to set a scene and sustain a mood reels you in deeply. On album opener \u2018K.\u2019, a tale of blossoming love etched in tiny details luxuriates over chiming guitars; on the hymn to romantic compulsion of \u2018Each Time You Fall in Love\u2019, the suspended animation of Angelo Badalamenti\u2019s heart-stopping Twin Peaks music is echoed. \u2018Sunsetz\u2019 and the gently lilting \u2018Sweet\u2019, meanwhile, showcase Gonzalez\u2019s ability to weave impressionistic snapshots of romance into melodies that haunt like memories of past loves, all coalescing around his melting vocals.\n\nElsewhere, Gonzalez mounts movies in miniature with the photographic references of \u2018Flash\u2019 and Fitzcarraldo echoes of \u2018Opera House\u2019, a song so lovingly languid it could, conceivably, soundtrack a man hauling ships over mountains for love. And, just as every good film-maker knows the need for a killer finale, so Gonzalez closes the album with the retro-romantic swing and teasingly filthy put-downs (the \u201csucking cock\u201d lyric isn\u2019t as barbed as it seems, just friendly joshing) of \u2018Young & Dumb\u2019, which brings the album to a close with good, timeless advice: \u201cDrive your car to the beach with the song on repeat\u2026\u201d.\n\nIf the result is the spirit of pop-noir romanticism distilled, it\u2019s also grand pay-off for Gonzalez\u2019s band\u2019s slow-burn gestation. Although Cigarettes seemed to spark into life over one breakthrough weekend in 2015, Gonzalez ignited the project in 2008. Early iterations nodded to 1980s-vintage New Order, Erasure and Madonna, before Gonzalez harkened back to darker influences such as Joy Division for a band makeover. A commitment to confessional, sexualised lyrics stuck early; Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u2018Chelsea Hotel No 2\u2019 numbered among Greg\u2019s reference points.\n\nFor some of the band\u2019s early years, Gonzalez studied music at the University of Texas, El Paso. He dropped out but his time there was not wasted. Attracted by the \u201cecho-y\u201d sonic potential of a university stairway, he recorded an EP there which, he says, \u201cended up being something special\u201d. Indeed, Cigarettes\u2019 2012 EP was so special Gonzalez struggled to follow it. When his patient perfectionism bore fruit with \u2018Affection\u2019, the online response took his breath away, he recalls. \u201cThere was this big flood of support over, like, a weekend\u2026 It was fairly emotional for me, because I\u2019d been waiting for that since I started writing music.\u201d\n\nPost-university, Gonzalez had moved to Brooklyn, where he bided his time working as a musician and managing a cinema, the Beekman Theatre on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. If his memories of holding private screenings with friends there sound romantic, so do his favourite films. The \u201cstrange mystery\u201d and \u201chazy\u201d romance of Antonioni\u2019s L\u2019Avventura was one influence; so was the \u201cautumnal beauty\u201d of Kieslowski\u2019s The Double Life of Veronique.\n\nTo mirror their woozy romanticism in music, Gonzalez rejected conventional studio routes for his band, which numbers Randy Miller on bass, Jacob Tomsky on drums and Tubbs on keyboards. Taking influence from The Cowboy Junkies\u2019 The Trinity Session (recorded in a church, single microphone), Cigarettes recorded most of the album in three days at the Sweatshop rehearsal space, Bushwick.

His new single \u201cBeautiful Life\u201d is captivating audiences.\n\nWhile many artists spend a lifetime chasing \u201cinternational status,\u201d 24-year-old classically trained singer-songwriter-musician Sebastian Mikael is already starting his career where others can only hope to finish. Born in Sweden to a Swedish father and Ethiopian mother, Sebastian Mikael\u2014formerly known as De-Lor (which is French for \u201cof gold\u201d)\u2014was raised in a diverse household that was enriched by music. While no one in his family ever made music professionally, Sebastian Mikael inherited his passion for music from his father and the sounds he grew up listening to inspired him to find out what was going on behind the music.\n\nWhat started off as a childhood hobby soon snowballed into an adolescent obsession that led to him picking up the guitar and mimicking the sounds he heard on the radio. \u201cI became interested in knowing exactly what the musicians were doing and how they got their sounds,\u201d says Sebastian Mikael, who started off playing his favorite songs by Marvin Gaye, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Wyclef Jean, Akon and Usher.\n\nBefore long, Sebastian Mikael\u2019s newfound passion led him to clocking long hours at Swedish recording studios, singing hooks for rappers and teaming up with a local producer to form a production team. But while the duo\u2019s initial recordings generated a lot of online buzz, Sebastian Mikael was eager to strike out on his own. \u201cI saw the initial potential of the work we were doing,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t getting a shot at doing my own songs. Plus, they are not as open-minded about music in Sweden as they are in the U.S.\u201d\n\nFeeling a glass ceiling approaching in Sweden, Sebastian Mikael set his sights on America and enrolled at California\u2019s Musicians Institute to study audio engineering in 2008. After living in California for two years, he relocated to Boston in 2010 to attend Berklee College of Music. While a student at Berklee, Sebastian was signed by Slip-N-Slide Records CEO Ted Lucas and in late 2011 he released his first mixtape, J\u2019Adore, which received rave reviews from his steadily growing fan base. His breakthrough video single, \u201cBeautiful Life,\u201d in which he sings an inspirational message about appreciating life, captures the essence of Sebastian Mikael\u2019s music as a whole. \u201cMy lyrical content is not always about love, but what we go through and feel in life,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to put hope in my music\u2014stuff that makes you feel good musically and lyrically.\u201d\n\nNow in the studio working on his hotly anticipated forthcoming full-length debut album due out in 2013, Sebastian Mikael has been busy collaborating with some of the finest producers and songwriters in the business, including Jim Jonsin and Rico Love.\n\nWith just a handful of years experience as a musician, Sebastian Mikael is already skilled at meshing elements of rock, R&B, pop and electronic music into one cohesive package, held together by his unique acoustic guitar playing. \u201cI feel like my music truly has something to say,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people hear my music, I want them to relate. The way my music makes me feel inside is usually the same way people feel when they hear it.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8983573.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Tue Oct 1 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-01", "Genre": "Genres: R&B", "OtherInfo": "Mahalia", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall"}, {"Address": "444 Battery Street, San Francisco, CA 94111", "Artist": "Joey Avery", "ArtistBio": "After starting his career in Cape Town, South Africa Joey Avery received the Jimmy Gunn award for Best Newcomer to the Bay Area comedy scene in 2014, and landed a top 10 video on Reddit.

The EP returns to peace with the dreamy \u201c426\u201d\u2014 the address of a summer residence in which Hana discovered a sense of place or belonging\u2014 though fleetingly, as her friends disbanded at the season\u2019s end. But, c\u2019est la vie. Solitude, for all its occasional pangs, is for Hana Vu as much a condition of her independence, a little breathing room from the throng to forge her own certain future in music. As she\u2019ll tell you, with poise and fairly pleased with things so far,\u201cI spend most of my time alone.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Tue Oct 1 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "ARIANNA NEIKRUG W/ LAURENCE HOBGOOD TRIO", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero West, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Arianna Neikrug", "ArtistBio": "After winning the 2015 Sarah Vaughan International Vocal Competition then performing at the Montreal International Jazz Festival the following year, 25-year-old singer and songwriter Arianna Neikrug makes her grander introduction to the music world with the August 24, 2018 release of Changes on Concord Jazz.\n\nProduced by the Grammy-winning pianist and arranger Laurence Hobgood, Changes displays Neikrug\u2019s gift for interpreting tunes from the Great American Songbook and more recent pop and R&B classics from the \u201970s. The disc also contains two originals that reveal some of Neikrug\u2019s journey from her hometown of Los Angeles to New York City, where she argues she truly belongs.\n\nHobgood, who recruited his regular trio mates \u2013 drummer Jared Schonig and bassist Matt Clohesy \u2013 for Changes, describes Neikrug as \u201can intellectual and complex person.\u201d \u201cI can honestly say that she\u2019s the most theoretically informed singer that I\u2019ve ever worked with \u2013 in terms of just knowing music,\u201d Hobgood says. \u201cShe understands the basic structures of music and how to talk about it. She has a healthy combination of being strong-willed with being totally open-minded to suggestions. Those are attributes of a singer with a long career.\u201d\n\nChanges begins with a hypnotic reading of \u201cNo Moon at All\u201d on which Neikrug initiates by pairing her comely soprano with Hobgood\u2019s economical piano accompaniment. Soon after the rhythm section enters the fray and buoys her along as she demonstrates her assured sense of swing, bluesy phrasing and remarkable scatting acumen.\n\nNeikrug\u2019s graceful rendition of \u201cSpring Can Really Hang You Up the Most\u201d is the second of the Great American Songbook compositions to appear on Changes. Neikrug says that she started singing the Fran Landesman and Tommy Wolf tune when she was only 17, but with little understanding of its emotional subtext. \u201cHow could I? First of all, living in Los Angeles, I only had summer my whole life. So, what is spring?\u201d Neikrug laughs. \u201cAfter I first moved to New York, I finally understood what spring was all about. I found out why so many songs are written about the weather and the seasons, because they make a huge difference in your mental and emotional state.\u201d\n\nThe disc shift gears with Neikrug\u2019s divine makeover of Al Green\u2019s R&B staple, \u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together\u201d on which she sings the pleading lyrics and succinct melody atop Hobgood\u2019s beguiling arrangement. Hobgood suggested the song to Neikrug during one of their first think-tank sessions while they were scanning Rolling Stone magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Best Songs.\u201d\n\nNeikrug\u2019s burgeoning songwriting talent gets the spotlight with \u201cChanges,\u201d the disc\u2019s title track. Spurred by a lithe samba rhythm, the song touches on the difficult period between graduating from Frost School of Music at the University of Miami with a bachelor of music degree in studio music and jazz vocal performance and applying for the Sarah Vaughan International Vocal Competition. \u201cI was going through my first major depressive episode,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was experiencing a rough time because I didn\u2019t have any structure or job yet. It was weird for me to be out in the real world and think, \u2018Okay? What do I do? How do I make a schedule? Where do I go?\u2019\u201d\n\nNow in hindsight, Neikrug sees that struggling, transitional period as a blessing because it afforded her some of life\u2019s big lows and highs, which enabled her to write more convincing life-based songs and interpret emotionally gripping standards. \u201cHaving to build yourself up when you\u2019re down is not an easy thing to do\u201d she says. \u201cBut how else are you going to write music from the heart and emote these big experiences that you can put into your art? In the worst way, it\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d\n\nChanges continues with the first of two intriguing mash-ups, \u201cNever Let Me Go/I\u2019ll Be There.\u201d Neikrug and Hobgood delve into Ray Evans and Jay Livingston\u2019s 1956 standard as a sparkling duet before the rhythm section slides in for a sumptuous rendition of the Jackson Five\u2019s Motown gem. \u201cI\u2019ve been pitching \u2018I\u2019ll Be There\u2019 as just a lush jazz ballad to a number of singers for about 15 years. Nobody has bit until now,\u201d Hobgood says.\n\nNeikrug returns to jazz standards with a blistering version of \u201cThe Song Is You,\u201d on which she flaunts her rhythmic and tonal agility before delivering her second original \u201cNew York Song,\u201d articulating her long desire to move to the Big Apple then returning to standard repertoire again by digging deep into the jazz canon for her bewitching, R&B-laden refurbishing of \u201cAfter You\u2019ve Gone,\u201d a Henry Creamer and Turner Layton classic that\u2019s 100-years-old. At the Sarah Vaughan International Competition, she\u2019d performed a vastly different, more up-tempo treatment of \u201cAfter You\u2019ve Gone\u201d during the final round.\n\nNeikrug then performs what she argues is the song that sealed her win at that aforementioned competition \u2013 Bob Dorough and Terrell Kirk\u2019s \u201cDevil May Care.\u201d Again, she explains that Hobgood\u2019s mesmeric arrangement differs from the one she performed at the competition, which she described as \u201csassier and more down-home blues.\n\nChanges concludes with its second mash-up \u2013 two Joni Mitchell songs \u201cHelp Me/Be Cool.\u201d After college graduation, Neikrug went on a Joni Mitchell binge, beginning with the 1971 landmark LP, Blue. \u201c[\u2018Help Me\u2019] sounds almost as if it were written for my voice,\u201d Neikrug says. \u201cThe key is perfect; the melody is perfect. The song is challenging enough that I had a desire to learn it. But it was also about storytelling and being young and full of angst.\u201d\n\nAfter agreeing on \u201cHelp Me,\u201d Hobgood suggested intertwining it with \u201cBe Cool.\u201d Neikrug had her reservations though. \u201cTo be honest, the first time I heard it, I said, \u2018OK, could you give me something a little bit harder to sing?\u2019\u201d Neikrug laughs. \u201cBut Laurence wanted to do a mash-up. It almost resembles how I wish pop music sounded. It still sounds really hip but it\u2019s challenging, eye-opening and re-imaginative.\u201d\n\nBlending the right amount of reverence for the jazz tradition with a knowing glance to modern pop and R&B classics, sprinkled with two inviting originals, Changes will delight both jazz purists and novices without making any unwise artistic compromises as she superbly negotiates the glories of jazz\u2019s past with a wide-eyed optimism that betrays her tender age. \u201cWhen you\u2019re recording your debut album, fresh out of college, you\u2019re not exactly sure how you want to present yourself,\u201d Neikrug explains. \u201cIt was easier figuring that out by discovering who I didn\u2019t want to be. I\u2019m just trying to take the jazz tradition and move it in my direction.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8783700.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Tue Oct 1 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-01", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "OtherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents Arianna Neikrug w/ Laurence Hobgood Trio", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, USA", "Artist": "Huun-Huur-Tu", "ArtistBio": "\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0443\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0425\u0443\u0443\u043d-\u0425\u0443\u0443\u0440-\u0422\u0443 / Official page of Tuva throat singers Huun Huur Tu", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8262992.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Tue Oct 1 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-01", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Ethno", "OtherInfo": "Huun Huur Tu", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Festival"}, {"Address": "860 San Pablo Ave, Albany, CA 94706", "Artist": "Smokers", "ArtistBio": "\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0443\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0425\u0443\u0443\u043d-\u0425\u0443\u0443\u0440-\u0422\u0443 / Official page of Tuva throat singers Huun Huur Tu", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.299266, 37.890398], "Date": "Tue Oct 1 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "Niki Saint Kitten Presents", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room"}, {"Address": "522 2nd St, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Profondo Rosso", "ArtistBio": "\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0443\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0425\u0443\u0443\u043d-\u0425\u0443\u0443\u0440-\u0422\u0443 / Official page of Tuva throat singers Huun Huur Tu", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.277791, 37.797058], "Date": "Tue Oct 1 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Oakland Metro Operahouse"}, {"Address": "1151 Folsom St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Phat Tuesday", "ArtistBio": "\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0443\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0425\u0443\u0443\u043d-\u0425\u0443\u0443\u0440-\u0422\u0443 / Official page of Tuva throat singers Huun Huur Tu", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.408767, 37.775679], "Date": "Tue Oct 1 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-01", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "\"Phat Tuesday\" w/ DJs Scotty Fox & Clinton Lee", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Raven Bar"}, {"Address": "859 O'Farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Jvck James", "ArtistBio": "SPVCEKID", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9064040.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Tue Oct 1 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-01", "Genre": "Genres: R&B, Soul", "OtherInfo": "Mahalia", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall"}, {"Address": "444 Battery St, San Francisco, CA 94111", "Artist": "Jim McVeigh", "ArtistBio": "Jim McVeigh is a stand up comic based in the SF Bay Area.

Sessions for Meltdown commenced once again at their home base of The Station House in Echo Park with engineer and co-producer Mark Rains (Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Waylon Jennings, etc).

Elsewhere, \"Why Is it so Hard To Be Good?\" lumbers to a start with thunderous early-Swans sounding drums leading a dark lament of our collective penchant to do wrong. Throughout the album there's chiming power-pop (\"Dead Celebrity Party\"), somber balladry (\"Summer Fades\", \"Obsession\"), dramatic pageantry that would make Born To Run era Springsteen blush (\"Angel of Sleep\") and so many other twists and turns that the album's dramatic title will make perfect sense. Sessions for Meltdown commenced once again at their home base of The Station House in Echo Park with engineer and co-producer Mark Rains (Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Waylon Jennings, etc). The line-up on Meltdown proves to be their most enduring, sturdiest and studied yet \u2013 familiar faces from their last effort being Hart\u2019s right hand man Christopher Rager on guitar (and co-producing), last O.G. member Hannah Blumenfeld on strings (the group has since turned her into an octopus string quartet in the studio \u2013 recently earning her full-string duties on the new Ghostface Killer record), secret weapon Marty Sataman on piano/synths, vocalists Jada Wagensomer, Marianne Stewart and Kristina B holding steady as three-part harmony dream team, with Wagensomer occasionally moving front and center as Hart\u2019s female counterpart, where they duet on \u201cWhy Is It So Hard To Be Good?\u201d and \u201c\u2026Keeping The Faith,\u201d also seeing her solo spotlight on \u201cA Promise\u201d and \u201c\u2026Never Going To Find Me.\u201d The new fierce rhythm section that came swinging to rescue the group from mid-recording uncertainty includes Morgan Hart Delaney on bass (and blood, as Hart\u2019s own cousin) and Hart\u2019s long co-conspirator Dave Clifford (The VSS, Pleasure Forever, Red Sparowes, Hart\u2019s own Starvations/Fortune\u2019s Flesh) on drums. Meltdown -- A Declaration of Unpopular Emotion will be available on LP and download via Neurotic Yell Records on August 27th, 2013.

Fronted by self-confessed contrarian Phil Labonte, the band has experimented with a range of styles including pop, rock and caustic metalcore with just one objective \u2013 to create great songs that come straight from the heart.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always been to write songs that we like,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cAll That Remains has seen a lot of criticism about the songs that we\u2019ve written and what people think we\u2019re supposed to do. We started as a very underground death metal kind of band, we\u2019ve since moved away from that and have never apologized for it. The music we\u2019ve written has been reflective of that and I think the lyrics, the ideas, have always been reflective of that as well.\u201d\n\nAnd through it all, All That Remains have experienced considerable success. The band\u2019s last album 2015\u2019s The Order of Things reached #3 on the Billboard U.S. Hard Rock Albums chart and #5 on their Top Rock Albums chart. And to date, All That Remains have sold over a million albums Worldwide. The band has headlined across the world and played major festivals, including the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Fest.\n\nYet along the way, All That Remains have taken flak from just about everybody: extreme metal purists who accused the group of selling out, rock fans that don\u2019t get the screamy stuff, liberals who object to Labonte\u2019s right-of-center lyrics and conservatives that can\u2019t understand the singer\u2019s non-violent, Libertarian ways. Labonte\u2019s response \u2013 bring it on!\n\nMadness, All That Remains\u2019 eighth album, is the band\u2019s most musically eclectic, provocative release to date \u2013 full of undeniable hooks, incisive riffs, electronic samples and a variety of vocal styles. And, of course, the range of subject matter addressed pushes the band\u2019s limits further than ever.\n\n\"I don't mind if I piss off if it gets them to think about things. People know that I have strong opinions and I disagree with things. That's my whole deal.\"\n\nAs contrary as he wants to be, Labonte still values quality over confrontation. Madness, produced by Grammy award winning Howard Benson (Halestorm, Papa Roach, Chris Cornell), is All That Remains at their best, offering a level of accessibility and diversity lacking from much of today\u2019s hard rock and metal. The first single and title track, \u201cMadness,\u201d is a microcosm for the rest of the album.\n\nThe song starts on an experimental note with a barrage of amp static and the buzzing of ungrounded electricity accompanied by a sharp, simple drum intro. A pause later, the whole band kicks into gear, blending a propulsive rhythm with a kinetic groove that swings like a rope ladder in a thunderstorm. As the vocals enter, the guitars drop out, replaced by a delicate keyboard melody and electronic beats. Then, after Labonte sings, \u201cWhy should we escape ourselves? We are who we are in the end,\u201d the tone shifts back in a heavier direction, leading to a monster chorus more infectious than influenza.\u201d In true Labonte style, the tune is neither a love song nor a euphoric anthem about rocking out. \u201cIt\u2019s about socialism,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the repetition of bad ideas.\u201d\n\nOther songs on Madness are far more variegated. The leadoff track \u201cSafe House,\u201d which is about a man who lures robbers into his home and then kills them, is the heaviest track All That Remains has written since they played melodic death metal in the first half of the aughts. Driven by barreling beats, thrashy guitars, a crushing breakdown and metalcore screaming, the track pulverizes even as haunting keyboards and clanging percussion offer a brief respite from the jackhammer pounding.\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cFar From Home,\u201d which shifts between ringing acoustic guitars and forlorn vocals about being lost and alone, and a euphoric rock passage that shows that there\u2019s always light in the darkness.\n\nThroughout Madness All That Remains revisits the dichotomy between savagery and sensitivity. \u201cTrust and Believe\u201d contrasts double-bass drums, chugging riffs and melodic guitar licks with soaring guitar melodies and an anthemic chant-along chorus and \u201cHalo\u201d opens with a speedy electronic passage that sounds like a violin on hyper drive, then develops into a blazing number that balances melodic vocals with pain stricken howls.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted this record to be different,\u201d Labonte says,\u201d explaining the inclusion of electronic samples and the dramatic juxtaposition between roaring chaos and accessible craftsmanship. \u201cWe wanted to really push ourselves and push the boundaries of what we\u2019re allowed to do. We\u2019ve always pushed that envelope, but we wanted to push it more.\u201d\n\nAll That Remains started working on Madness in the spring of 2016, then in April Labonte flew from his home in Western Massachusetts to Los Angeles to start working on vocal melodies and lyrics with Benson. It was the first time the band didn\u2019t have fleshed out riffs and fully written rhythms to serve as guideposts for the vocals. At first, the process was difficult and the band members were uncomfortable, but the more they worked on the record the more excited they became about the way the songs were coming out. For the first time in years, they felt genuinely challenged and inspired to learn new ways to create.\n\n\u201cMe, Mike and Oli are the primary writers and we\u2019ve always written songs on guitars because we\u2019re all guitar players,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt was a totally different way to write songs. And I feel like it was really, really cool to do that because it gave us a fresh perspective. I\u2019d bring Mike and Oli the vocals and they\u2019d use what I had come up with to construct the riffs instead of the other way around.\u201d\n\nThe most difficult song for Labonte to create was \u201cRivercity.\u201d The song begins with a ringing telephone and progresses through an electronic beat, a melancholy, ballad-like guitar line and plaintive vocals. The track changes in intensity numerous times and injects various rhythm shifts before ending like it began. When he was working on \u201cRivercity,\u201d Labonte\u2019s then-wife was deployed in the Middle East in the Marines and the singer was left helpless at home while she risked her life on the front lines.\n\nWhile the title \u201cRivercity\u201d sounds like an innocent enough name for a song \u2013 the kind of title John Mellencamp might use about childhood memories -- for Labonte the term was very real and frightening. \u201cRivercity stands for \u2018reduced communications,\u2019 he explains. \u201cMe and my ex would be on the phone and she\u2019d be like, \u201cYo, the base is getting mortared. I gotta go.\u2019 If someone dies, they shut off communications until they can notify the families of the people that die. So we\u2019d be talking and she would say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to rivercity and hang up, and I wouldn\u2019t talk to her for three or four days and I wouldn\u2019t know what happened. The base is getting mortared. She might have taken a round or died. Being on the other end of that is agonizing.\u201d\n\nIntegrating excruciating personal experiences, political rants and controversial commentary with music that\u2019s just as confrontational, Madness is an unapologetic showcase of honesty and ingenuity. Inducing gentle head-bobbing one moment and inciting teeth-clenching fist pounding the next, All That Remains have created about 50 minutes of attitude-laden rock music.

Is anyone challenging what the listener expects anymore? We don\u2019t do stuff because we\u2019re supposed to.\u201d\n\nLabonte accepts he\u2019ll continue to be misunderstood. Some will love Madness, some won\u2019t, but the album will make an impression on everyone who gives it an honest listen. Asked how he\u2019d like to viewed, Labonte responds, \u201cI want to be the guy that really challenges people\u2019s ideas. I\u2019m fucking punk rock. Punk rock hasn\u2019t been punk rock for 30 years. For too long metal has been bullshit, milky pandering crap. What happened to metal? What happened to punk rock? What happened to being anti-establishment?

They debuted as Complicated Animals in 2015, with the release of their 6-song EP \u201cIn This Game\u201d. Written and recorded in a cabin in the woods in Michigan, \u201cIn This Game\u201d received rave reviews from blogs and journalists, and was called the \u201cbeginning of a new sound\u201d by PopMatters.\n\nComplicated Animals released their brand new single Show Me on 1/19/18. While creating their new track, Monica da Silva and Chad Alger were greatly inspired by their recent move to Los Angeles, the music of the 80s, a love for lush, dreamy pop songs, and all things David Lynch. The Brazilian American duo say that although their new track encompasses more of an electronic, synth-based feel, the lyrical subject matter was based on organic, human emotion.\n\n\u201cShow Me (that you want me) really struck me as an intense idea for a song,\u201d says vocalist da Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s scary how detached we humans have become. Technology is great, but we\u2019ve got to remember how important human interaction is, and not just go through the motions like zombies. For this song, Chad dug an old synthesizer we had out of the closet. We started stacking sounds and layering vocals. The production came together quickly, and virtually all of the sounds in the track were created using the same synth.\u201d\n\nMonica da Silva's song Back To His Girl is now featured in the movie Lady Bird. Complicated Animals\u2019 music has also been featured in The World Cup, on international compilations such as Putumayo World Music\u2019s Brazilian Beat, and Ibiza Beats, in the BBC One drama The Replacement, and is slated to appear in the upcoming Paramount Network series American Woman.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8537608.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.457444, 38.284075], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Indie Pop, Brazilian Music, Bossa Nova, Electronic, Dream Pop, Alternative, Acoustic, Singer, Songwriter", "OtherInfo": "We are excited to present the MacArthur Place Sessions \u2013 a weekly live music series featuring local bands in our classically-styled Bar.

The record was named as one of the \"10 Best Metal Albums of 2017\" by AXS.com. MetalSucks wrote that \"Medusa\" is \"a synthesis of all manner of melodic, progressive, technical metal \u2014 Dream Theater, Opeth, et al. \u2014 mixed with a groovy, almost tribal approach trafficked by \u201990s stalwarts like Sepultura and Fear Factory.

Certainly not.\"\n\nUncured is quickly gaining a reputation among fans and critics for its aggressive, technical, yet highly diverse live performances. Metal Injection reported that \"Uncured sounds a bit like old school Dream Theater with some modern tricks thrown in, such as full-on breakdowns and smoking guitar acrobatics. This is band comprised of extremely talented and promising young musicians.\"\n\nMetal Assault Magazine reported that \"the talent in musical composition and song arrangement was vastly evident right from the outset, and it never ceased to engage and compel.

Formed, written, and lead by two teenagers, is truly insane.\" The magazine continued that Uncured has \"the sound of old school metal with an influx of modern solos and rhythms, while vocally pulling from a death metal side of things. The solos were the contrast to their music, very progressive sounding and very technical, whereas their song structure was brutal and heavy.\"\n\nCritics have commented on the diversity of Uncured's sound. CrypticRock.com reports that Uncured \"matches speedy, technical guitar riffs with blistering drumming--but the true highlight of Uncured's live set is the ability to slow it down at the drop of a dime, mixing in darker, compelling storylines amidst all the chaos.\" Metal Nexus reviewed Uncured's show in Washington, DC: \"It has been a long time since I have been this utterly impressed by a new band with only a debut album. And how often do you see two vocalists unleashing harsh vocals with intense yet melodic riffs? The young lads with their youthful energy, technical prowess, and blistering speed set the stage on fire.\"\n\nUncured released Spontaneous Generation in 2016, a 4-song instrumental EP.

Stephen\u2019s most recent writing work with legendary guitarist Robert Randolph, led to a 2017 Grammy nomination for \"Best Contemporary Blues Record.\" He's also had his songs covered by international major label acts and released ten studio albums of his own yielding hundreds of thousands of ticket and record sales.\n\nA father of four and married to his high school sweetheart, filmmaker Peter Harding was so moved by the everyman nature of Kellogg's story that he made a documentary called \"Last Man Standing\" which went on to become an Amazon exclusive film. In recent years, Kellogg has added authorship and speaking to his resume as well. He delivered a TEDx Talk on job satisfaction, the key note speech for the prestigious photography summit WRKSHP, and was invited to speak to the students at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO on the topics of social justice and 'finding your voice.\u2019 He has appeared as a contributing author in several publications and in 2019, will be publishing his first full length book entitled \u201cObjects in the Mirror: A Storyteller\u2019s Take On What Matters Most.\u201d\n\nKellogg\u2019s newest studio album, \u201cObjects in the Mirror\u201d, was recorded over the course of a single week in Nashville, TN. Produced by Will Hoge and featuring twelve songs that explore American life in 2018, the decision was made to track the band live, keeping the results in tact with minimal overdubs. \u201cI wanted to make an album that sounded and felt like the ones I grew up loving; Bob Seger and Cat Stevens, Tom Petty and Rod Stewart. Emotional records where the songs relate to each other and the lyrics are front and center. That\u2019s my true north.\u201d Kellogg\u2019s emotion has never been in question with one music blogger succinctly describing his music as \u2018a beautiful display of\u2014well, his heart.\u201d And as for the lyrics, Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz can lately be heard singing their praises on his \u2018Underwater Sunshine\u2019 podcasts.\n\nWhile Stephen Kellogg may have remained underneath the radar for some in the mainstream, he has succeeded in building a meaningful career alongside many of the best in the business. He\u2019s sung duets with Sara Bareilles, Josh Ritter, Rosanne Cash, and Pat Monahan of Train and participated in the 2018 \u201cGarden Of Dreams\u2019 concert at the Beacon Theater. His music has found its way onto the Billboard charts and been featured in numerous films and TV shows. Whether performing solo or with a band, Kellogg\u2019s soul and energy fuel one of the most dynamic shows anywhere. \u201cWith beautifully written songs and an engaging personality\u201d, The Michigan Daily reports, \u201cKellogg appears as if he was born on stage, taking the spotlight and using it to his advantage, but never letting go of his connection with the audience.\u201d A master storyteller in his prime, he will spend much of 2019 where he\u2019s always been at home\u2026the road.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9096104.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: singer songwriter, Rock n Roll", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads"}, {"Address": "90 Railroad Ave, Danville, CA 94526", "Artist": "Sunny And The Black Pack", "ArtistBio": "Since 2015, Sunny And The Black Pack have been building a reputation as true visionaries in the music scene.

A native of Leesburg, Florida, Croker is the grandson of the late great jazz trumpeter Doc Cheatham. He began playing trumpet around age 11 after hearing Cheatham play in New York City, and by his teens was studying music at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in Jacksonville, Florida. From 2003 to 2007, Croker attended the music conservatory at Oberlin College. While at Oberlin, he was mentored by legendary trumpeter and educator Donald Byrd. Also during this time, he earned the Presser Music Foundation Award, which funded his debut album, 2006's Fundamentals. After graduating Oberlin, Croker relocated to China, where he took up residency at Shanghai's House of Blues. His 2009 album, In the Tradition, paid tribute to Cheatham.\n\nIn 2013, Croker returned to the States and began work on his third solo album, the Dee Dee Bridgewater-produced Afro Physicist. Released in 2014 on OKeh/Sony Masterworks Records, the Echo Award nominated album found him branching out stylistically, weaving elements of funk, Latin jazz, and hip-hop into his sound. In 2016, he delivered Escape Velocity, which found him delving deeper into a genre-bending, spiritually enlightened, funk-influenced jazz sound.\n\nUpon the album\u2019s release, The Wall Street Journal heralded the album as \u201c timeless and of-the-moment\u201d. His live performances, the Huffington Post lauded Croker\u2019s band DVRKFUNK, saying they were \u201ca tight front line that weave in serpentine precision and are backed by a powerful rhythm section that pushes the groove.\u201d Outside of his solo career, Croker has lent his inimitable talents as composer, arranger and musician to J.

Others chronicle their times. It\u2019s a rare artist who can do both, telling their own story through songs that also encapsulate the essence of people and places who have helped define their era overall. Woody Guthrie comes to mind, and so does Bob Dylan. Bruce Springsteen certainly as well. Yet few others, for whatever genius they may possess, can relate their own history to the history experienced by those who find that common bond, be it in a coming of age, living through the same realities or sharing similar experiences. Ellis Paul is one of those gifted singer/songwriters.Though some may refer to him as a folksinger, he is more, for lack of a better word, a singular storyteller, a musician whose words reach out from inside and yet also express the feelings, thoughts and sensibilities that most people can relate to in one way or another, regardless of age or upbringing. The exhilaration of the open road. A celebration of heroes. The hope for redemption. Descriptions of those things that are both near and dear. The sharing of love..., intimate, passionate and enduring. These are the scenarios that emerge from Ellis Paul\u2019s new album, Chasing Beauty, a set of songs which detail, in typical Paul fashion, stories of people and places that reflect larger truths about us all. \u201cKick Out the Lights (Johnny Cash)\u201d pays tribute to that fearless American icon name-checked in its title. \u201cPlastic Soldier\u201d offers homage to a wounded soldier returning from Afghanistan.

In reality, these stories are a continuation of tales Paul has told for more than a quarter century, over the expanse of nineteen albums, numerous critical kudos (15 Boston Music Awards alone), inclusion in several movie soundtracks, and stages he\u2019s headlined both near and far. \u201cI\u2019ve got a car with over 475,000 miles on it, and it's my third road vehicle,\u201d Paul declares. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing 200 shows a year for over twenty years. There isn\u2019t a town in the country where I won\u2019t find a friend. I\u2019m a nomad. And I\u2019m gonna write and play until I\u2019m gone.\u201d No doubt he will. Still, it\u2019s somewhat ironic that Paul gravitated towards this bigger world of intent and expression given that the place Paul considers his hometown these days isn\u2019t New York or Nashville, or Boston or Austin or Charlottesville, VA. where he lives, but rather Presque Isle, Maine, a tiny enclave surrounded by three rivers. Not surprisingly, the name translates to \u201calmost an island.\u201d Presque Isle shares a vanishing tradition with many small towns these days, where family farms are giving way to industrialization and giant corporations, and earning a livelihood from the land is no longer the simple option it once was. Nevertheless, it\u2019s still a haven for traditional values and for people as real and authentic as the soil they once tilled. If there\u2019s one grace left to cling to, it\u2019s the grace of nature\u2019s beauty, sealed off by the surrounding mountains and fields. Likewise, his geographical origins also couldn\u2019t have been further from the world at large. He was born in the dead of winter in the small town of Fort Kent, Maine, a place nestled right up next to the Canadian border. He came from humble origins, a family of potato farmers who could count among their forebears a veteran of the battle of Gettysburg, whose heroism on that field of honor earned him the 140 acres of Maine farmland that his descendants would continue to sow. It was the place that taught Paul the meaning of hard work and self-reliance, and the values that accompany as much drive and determination any individual could muster. As a boy, Paul found his escape in athletics, working out as a runner and testing his mettle in the open spaces near his home. He became a star competitor, and enjoyed the advantage of traveling throughout the nation after being given opportunities to compete. Along the way, he saw more of the country than most people do in a lifetime. \u201cI was lucky to be able to travel for competitions all over the U.S. and to see places I once could only dream of,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles, the endless plains of Texas, the Kansas prairie, the Rocky Mountain in Wyoming. Every trip was funded by a hat the town passed around on my behalf, and it never came back empty.\u201d When Paul finished second in a nationwide track competition, he was met at the airport by the high school marching band and a fire engine with spinning lights that drove him in triumph through town. In an expression of hometown pride, the mayor handed him the key to the city. No one ever told Paul he had to follow in his family\u2019s tradition. He was a dreamer after all, and he had seen enough of America to know there was more out there than his little town could ever offer. Consequently, his ambitions were never destined to stay bottled up for long. He would write, paint, play trumpet and sing in the school choir. \u201cI never had anyone tell me I had to be a farmer,\u201d Paul insists. \u201cI had plenty of people telling me how my hard work and talent could take me places. That\u2019s enough to get you dreaming, And enough to make you believe those dreams are within reach.\u201d Indeed, Paul found those dreams were within his reach, at least in terms of his imagination. However their pursuit would take him far from home. His first destination was Boston College, courtesy of a track scholarship. Yet as Paul describes it, his athletic endeavors, combined with his academic responsibilities, served to rob him of his creativity. It was only after he suffered a knee injury which forced him to take a year off that he rebounded with a new form of expression, made possible when his girlfriend\u2019s sister gave him a secondhand guitar. \u201cA mysterious, lustful partnership with the instrument followed,\u201d Paul concedes. \u201cIt became a marriage, a friendship, a lifelong bond that only comes when you find that one thing that becomes an extension of yourself. I played for hours, choosing to write my own original songs and sing instead of studying, socializing or exploring what the Boston streets could offer after hours.\u201d After graduation, Paul did find time to explore those paths, while taking opportunities to indulge his creative ambitions. Working as a teacher and social worker with inner city children by day and pursuing the possibilities offered by Boston\u2019s fertile music scene at night, he gained prominence in local coffeehouses and open mic nights. It was the same circuit that opened the door for other like-minded artists of the day, and in turn, gave Paul exposure to such creative contemporaries as Shawn Colvin, Dar Williams, Patty Larkin, John Gorka, Catie Curtis, and Bill Morrissey. It also helped him win a Boston Underground Songwriting competition and placement on a Windham Hill Records singer/songwriter compilation, bringing him his first hint of national exposure at the same time. The major tipping point in his career came with the opportunity to open for Bill Morrissey, one of New England\u2019s most prominent folk artists. Paul would repeatedly ask Morrissey about his own influences and seek his advice on who he ought to listen to. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s a very smart thing to do,\u201d Morrissey muses. \u201cIt helped set him apart. A lot of young singers I meet are not curious about what went on before; they just say, \u2018I want to sing another song about my life.\u2019 Paul has a sense of roots, of connectedness to the whole history of folk music; he sees the thread that runs through all the generations of this music.\u201d It was mutual admiration that caused Paul to ask Morrissey to produce his first full album, 1993\u2018s Say Something. It was released on Black Wolf Records, the label he founded with Ralph Jaccodine, the man who would become his manager. \u201cRalph was fulfilling a dream to get into the music business,\u201d Paul recalls. \u201cStarting with a folk singer isn\u2019t a rocket launch, but we got off the ground. We started a label and began a lifelong, DIY partnership and have been in the trenches for over 20 years.\u201d Paul also became infatuated with the music of Woody Guthrie, drawn to Woody\u2019s social consciousness and the humanitarian streak that ran through his work. He even had a tattoo of Guthrie imprinted on his right shoulder, referring to it as \u201ca badge of who he was.\u201d His commitment to Guthrie\u2019s legacy eventually led to his inclusion in a ten day celebration of Woody\u2019s work held at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 1996, an event that included such notables as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, the Indigo Girls and Ani DiFranco and which was presided over by Guthrie\u2019s daughter Nora. Later, when Guthrie\u2019s hometown of Okemah, Oklahoma hosted the first Woody Guthrie Folk Festival in July, 1998, Paul was tapped as one of the headliners. He has since made this an annual part of his touring schedule, garnering the honor of being named an honorary citizen of Okemah in the process. The connection with Guthrie continued into the new millennium when Nora Guthrie invited him to put music to a set of her father\u2019s lyrics. He later participated in the \u201cRibbon of Highway\u201d tour, a communal salute featuring such luminaries as Arlo Guthrie, Marty Stuart, Ramblin\u2019 Jack Ellott, Nanci Griffith, Guy Clark and Janis Ian, among others. There\u2019s likely no greater evidence of how Guthrie\u2019s insights and humanity have rubbed off on Paul than in this particularly telling tribute from Nora Guthrie. \"A singer songwriter is only as good as the times he reflects,\u201dshe said in praising Paul. \u201cIn times like these, when so many nuts are running the show, it's comforting to know that Ellis Paul is actually holding our sanity on his own stage! Wise, tender, brilliant and biting, Ellis is one of our best human compasses, marking in melodies and poems where we've been and where we might go if we so choose to. Personally Ellis, I'm goin' where you're goin'!\" Where Paul is \u201cgoin\u2019\u201d is to practically every place a microphone beckons and a crowd of the folk faithful awaits. He\u2019s become a staple at the Newport Folk Festival, played Carnegie hall, and venues from Alaska to Miami, Paris and London. In addition to his 19 albums released on the Rounder and Black Wolf record labels, his music has appeared on dozens of distinguished compilations. A Film/DVD entitled 3000 Miles -- part concert film, part documentary, part instructional video -- provides a further prospective on both the man and his music. He\u2019s also released a pair of children\u2019s albums, earning him honors from the Parent\u2019s Choice Foundation for both. His latest, \"The Hero In You\" has been turned into a picture book, detailing the lives of great American heroes. Ellis' literate, evocative and insightful writings are further showcased in a book of poetry and short stories entitled \u201cNotes from the Road,\" already in it's third pressing. It\u2019s no wonder then that recently Paul received a prestigious honor: an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the University of Maine, which also asked him to write the school's alma mater as well as deliver its commencement address in May 2014. Happily, his music has been shared with a wider audience as well, through commercials, documentaries, TV shows and in the soundtracks of several blockbuster films, among them three by the Farrelly Brothers -- \u201cHall Pass\u201d (starring Owen Wilson and Alyssa Milano), \u201cMe, Myself, & Irene\u201d (starring Jim Carrey) and \u201cShallow Hal\u201d (starring Jack Black and Gwyneth Paltrow). Peter Farrelly summed up the sentiments of all those who have come to know and appreciate Paul\u2019s music by referring to him as \u201ca national treasure.\u201d Not surprisingly, Paul\u2019s consistently been heralded by others as well. One writer noted \u201cthat it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music -- storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless, indifferent would, out music doesn\u2019t have to reflect our culture.\" Another reviewer was even more pointed. \u201cEllis Paul is one of the best singer/songwriters of his generation,\u201d she commented. \u201cAnd for many of us he is the face of contemporary folk music. Few are as smart, as literate, as poetic as Paul. I cannot think of another artist on the acoustic music scene is better loved by fans, or more respected by his contemporaries.\u201d Indeed, he is all that, and in a very real sense, even more. He\u2019s an observer, a philosopher, and an astute storyteller who shares with his listeners the life lessons he\u2019s learned, and in turn, life lessons they ought to heed as well. By affirming and defining who he is, Ellis Paul affirms and uncovers the essence of us all. -- Lee Zimmerman (writer/reviewer for American Songwriter, No Depression, New Times, Country Standard Time, Blurt, Relix, and M Music and Musicians) www.EllisPaul.com", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7458566.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.272093, 37.871966], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: Acoustic, Folk, Singer Songwriter", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Back Room Music"}, {"Address": "1743 San Pablo Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Ghost Town Hangmen", "ArtistBio": "'Despite his success and sense of history, Mr. Paul remains an artist with his eye on the future and an interest in discovering the transformative potential in his music.' - The New York Times Some artists document their lives through their music.

Ellis' literate, evocative and insightful writings are further showcased in a book of poetry and short stories entitled \u201cNotes from the Road,\" already in it's third pressing. It\u2019s no wonder then that recently Paul received a prestigious honor: an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the University of Maine, which also asked him to write the school's alma mater as well as deliver its commencement address in May 2014. Happily, his music has been shared with a wider audience as well, through commercials, documentaries, TV shows and in the soundtracks of several blockbuster films, among them three by the Farrelly Brothers -- \u201cHall Pass\u201d (starring Owen Wilson and Alyssa Milano), \u201cMe, Myself, & Irene\u201d (starring Jim Carrey) and \u201cShallow Hal\u201d (starring Jack Black and Gwyneth Paltrow). Peter Farrelly summed up the sentiments of all those who have come to know and appreciate Paul\u2019s music by referring to him as \u201ca national treasure.\u201d Not surprisingly, Paul\u2019s consistently been heralded by others as well. One writer noted \u201cthat it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music -- storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless, indifferent would, out music doesn\u2019t have to reflect our culture.\" Another reviewer was even more pointed. \u201cEllis Paul is one of the best singer/songwriters of his generation,\u201d she commented. \u201cAnd for many of us he is the face of contemporary folk music. Few are as smart, as literate, as poetic as Paul. I cannot think of another artist on the acoustic music scene is better loved by fans, or more respected by his contemporaries.\u201d Indeed, he is all that, and in a very real sense, even more. He\u2019s an observer, a philosopher, and an astute storyteller who shares with his listeners the life lessons he\u2019s learned, and in turn, life lessons they ought to heed as well. By affirming and defining who he is, Ellis Paul affirms and uncovers the essence of us all. -- Lee Zimmerman (writer/reviewer for American Songwriter, No Depression, New Times, Country Standard Time, Blurt, Relix, and M Music and Musicians) www.EllisPaul.com", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.272395, 37.80758], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "Live at The New Parish", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The New Parish"}, {"Address": "406 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Andrew Bundy", "ArtistBio": "'Despite his success and sense of history, Mr. Paul remains an artist with his eye on the future and an interest in discovering the transformative potential in his music.' - The New York Times Some artists document their lives through their music. Others chronicle their times. It\u2019s a rare artist who can do both, telling their own story through songs that also encapsulate the essence of people and places who have helped define their era overall. Woody Guthrie comes to mind, and so does Bob Dylan. Bruce Springsteen certainly as well. Yet few others, for whatever genius they may possess, can relate their own history to the history experienced by those who find that common bond, be it in a coming of age, living through the same realities or sharing similar experiences. Ellis Paul is one of those gifted singer/songwriters.Though some may refer to him as a folksinger, he is more, for lack of a better word, a singular storyteller, a musician whose words reach out from inside and yet also express the feelings, thoughts and sensibilities that most people can relate to in one way or another, regardless of age or upbringing. The exhilaration of the open road. A celebration of heroes. The hope for redemption. Descriptions of those things that are both near and dear. The sharing of love..., intimate, passionate and enduring. These are the scenarios that emerge from Ellis Paul\u2019s new album, Chasing Beauty, a set of songs which detail, in typical Paul fashion, stories of people and places that reflect larger truths about us all. \u201cKick Out the Lights (Johnny Cash)\u201d pays tribute to that fearless American icon name-checked in its title. \u201cPlastic Soldier\u201d offers homage to a wounded soldier returning from Afghanistan.

In reality, these stories are a continuation of tales Paul has told for more than a quarter century, over the expanse of nineteen albums, numerous critical kudos (15 Boston Music Awards alone), inclusion in several movie soundtracks, and stages he\u2019s headlined both near and far. \u201cI\u2019ve got a car with over 475,000 miles on it, and it's my third road vehicle,\u201d Paul declares. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing 200 shows a year for over twenty years. There isn\u2019t a town in the country where I won\u2019t find a friend. I\u2019m a nomad. And I\u2019m gonna write and play until I\u2019m gone.\u201d No doubt he will. Still, it\u2019s somewhat ironic that Paul gravitated towards this bigger world of intent and expression given that the place Paul considers his hometown these days isn\u2019t New York or Nashville, or Boston or Austin or Charlottesville, VA. where he lives, but rather Presque Isle, Maine, a tiny enclave surrounded by three rivers. Not surprisingly, the name translates to \u201calmost an island.\u201d Presque Isle shares a vanishing tradition with many small towns these days, where family farms are giving way to industrialization and giant corporations, and earning a livelihood from the land is no longer the simple option it once was. Nevertheless, it\u2019s still a haven for traditional values and for people as real and authentic as the soil they once tilled. If there\u2019s one grace left to cling to, it\u2019s the grace of nature\u2019s beauty, sealed off by the surrounding mountains and fields. Likewise, his geographical origins also couldn\u2019t have been further from the world at large. He was born in the dead of winter in the small town of Fort Kent, Maine, a place nestled right up next to the Canadian border. He came from humble origins, a family of potato farmers who could count among their forebears a veteran of the battle of Gettysburg, whose heroism on that field of honor earned him the 140 acres of Maine farmland that his descendants would continue to sow. It was the place that taught Paul the meaning of hard work and self-reliance, and the values that accompany as much drive and determination any individual could muster. As a boy, Paul found his escape in athletics, working out as a runner and testing his mettle in the open spaces near his home. He became a star competitor, and enjoyed the advantage of traveling throughout the nation after being given opportunities to compete. Along the way, he saw more of the country than most people do in a lifetime. \u201cI was lucky to be able to travel for competitions all over the U.S. and to see places I once could only dream of,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles, the endless plains of Texas, the Kansas prairie, the Rocky Mountain in Wyoming. Every trip was funded by a hat the town passed around on my behalf, and it never came back empty.\u201d When Paul finished second in a nationwide track competition, he was met at the airport by the high school marching band and a fire engine with spinning lights that drove him in triumph through town. In an expression of hometown pride, the mayor handed him the key to the city. No one ever told Paul he had to follow in his family\u2019s tradition. He was a dreamer after all, and he had seen enough of America to know there was more out there than his little town could ever offer. Consequently, his ambitions were never destined to stay bottled up for long. He would write, paint, play trumpet and sing in the school choir. \u201cI never had anyone tell me I had to be a farmer,\u201d Paul insists. \u201cI had plenty of people telling me how my hard work and talent could take me places. That\u2019s enough to get you dreaming, And enough to make you believe those dreams are within reach.\u201d Indeed, Paul found those dreams were within his reach, at least in terms of his imagination. However their pursuit would take him far from home. His first destination was Boston College, courtesy of a track scholarship. Yet as Paul describes it, his athletic endeavors, combined with his academic responsibilities, served to rob him of his creativity. It was only after he suffered a knee injury which forced him to take a year off that he rebounded with a new form of expression, made possible when his girlfriend\u2019s sister gave him a secondhand guitar. \u201cA mysterious, lustful partnership with the instrument followed,\u201d Paul concedes. \u201cIt became a marriage, a friendship, a lifelong bond that only comes when you find that one thing that becomes an extension of yourself. I played for hours, choosing to write my own original songs and sing instead of studying, socializing or exploring what the Boston streets could offer after hours.\u201d After graduation, Paul did find time to explore those paths, while taking opportunities to indulge his creative ambitions. Working as a teacher and social worker with inner city children by day and pursuing the possibilities offered by Boston\u2019s fertile music scene at night, he gained prominence in local coffeehouses and open mic nights. It was the same circuit that opened the door for other like-minded artists of the day, and in turn, gave Paul exposure to such creative contemporaries as Shawn Colvin, Dar Williams, Patty Larkin, John Gorka, Catie Curtis, and Bill Morrissey. It also helped him win a Boston Underground Songwriting competition and placement on a Windham Hill Records singer/songwriter compilation, bringing him his first hint of national exposure at the same time. The major tipping point in his career came with the opportunity to open for Bill Morrissey, one of New England\u2019s most prominent folk artists. Paul would repeatedly ask Morrissey about his own influences and seek his advice on who he ought to listen to. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s a very smart thing to do,\u201d Morrissey muses. \u201cIt helped set him apart. A lot of young singers I meet are not curious about what went on before; they just say, \u2018I want to sing another song about my life.\u2019 Paul has a sense of roots, of connectedness to the whole history of folk music; he sees the thread that runs through all the generations of this music.\u201d It was mutual admiration that caused Paul to ask Morrissey to produce his first full album, 1993\u2018s Say Something. It was released on Black Wolf Records, the label he founded with Ralph Jaccodine, the man who would become his manager. \u201cRalph was fulfilling a dream to get into the music business,\u201d Paul recalls. \u201cStarting with a folk singer isn\u2019t a rocket launch, but we got off the ground. We started a label and began a lifelong, DIY partnership and have been in the trenches for over 20 years.\u201d Paul also became infatuated with the music of Woody Guthrie, drawn to Woody\u2019s social consciousness and the humanitarian streak that ran through his work. He even had a tattoo of Guthrie imprinted on his right shoulder, referring to it as \u201ca badge of who he was.\u201d His commitment to Guthrie\u2019s legacy eventually led to his inclusion in a ten day celebration of Woody\u2019s work held at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 1996, an event that included such notables as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, the Indigo Girls and Ani DiFranco and which was presided over by Guthrie\u2019s daughter Nora. Later, when Guthrie\u2019s hometown of Okemah, Oklahoma hosted the first Woody Guthrie Folk Festival in July, 1998, Paul was tapped as one of the headliners. He has since made this an annual part of his touring schedule, garnering the honor of being named an honorary citizen of Okemah in the process. The connection with Guthrie continued into the new millennium when Nora Guthrie invited him to put music to a set of her father\u2019s lyrics. He later participated in the \u201cRibbon of Highway\u201d tour, a communal salute featuring such luminaries as Arlo Guthrie, Marty Stuart, Ramblin\u2019 Jack Ellott, Nanci Griffith, Guy Clark and Janis Ian, among others. There\u2019s likely no greater evidence of how Guthrie\u2019s insights and humanity have rubbed off on Paul than in this particularly telling tribute from Nora Guthrie. \"A singer songwriter is only as good as the times he reflects,\u201dshe said in praising Paul. \u201cIn times like these, when so many nuts are running the show, it's comforting to know that Ellis Paul is actually holding our sanity on his own stage! Wise, tender, brilliant and biting, Ellis is one of our best human compasses, marking in melodies and poems where we've been and where we might go if we so choose to. Personally Ellis, I'm goin' where you're goin'!\" Where Paul is \u201cgoin\u2019\u201d is to practically every place a microphone beckons and a crowd of the folk faithful awaits. He\u2019s become a staple at the Newport Folk Festival, played Carnegie hall, and venues from Alaska to Miami, Paris and London. In addition to his 19 albums released on the Rounder and Black Wolf record labels, his music has appeared on dozens of distinguished compilations. A Film/DVD entitled 3000 Miles -- part concert film, part documentary, part instructional video -- provides a further prospective on both the man and his music. He\u2019s also released a pair of children\u2019s albums, earning him honors from the Parent\u2019s Choice Foundation for both. His latest, \"The Hero In You\" has been turned into a picture book, detailing the lives of great American heroes.

The release features eight songs of rabble-rousing political commentary that turns a critical eye on the crisis of conscience and culture threatening to tear apart his country. The album is Hoge's impassioned portrait of what he holds dear \u2014 and what we all might risk losing.\nThe first song that Hoge completed was \u201cThoughts & Prayers,\u201d inspired directly by the mass of school shootings and the inept response of politicians. The song is an acoustic ballad in which Hoge asks, \"Why don't you do your job up there? Keep your thoughts and prayers.\" It's a raw, fiery song with just Hoge and his guitar, belting out his frustrations in the recording booth. In addition, Hoge is a member of the Music Council of Everytown For Gun Safety, which aims to bring more Americans and music fans into the gun safety movement.\n\nFor the \u201cThoughts & Prayers\u201d video, Hoge has boldly highlighted politicians tweets into a masterful piece of art.\n\nRecorded in Nashville at Sound Emporium, Hoge incorporated his touring band into his permanent lineup: Thom Donavan (lead guitar), Chris Griffiths (bass) and Allen Jones (drums). Hoge took the production reins, while celebrated Nashville producer Ray Kennedy (Steve Earle, Ray Davies) was enlisted for mixing duties.\n\nOn My American Dream, Hoge puts himself in someone else's shoes, be it the homeless heartland worker who watched his job prospects head overseas on \"My American Dream\" or the Mexican immigrant crossing the border to provide for his family on \"Illegal Line.\" At their core, both songs are about empathy. \"At the end of the day, that's really what folks are after, is just to be treated with some respect,\" he says. He knows how fragile life can be, having been left in critical condition by a scooter accident 10 years ago. \"I was on the brink of things being a disaster. I started to see how quickly, even someone who's working hard, can end up in a situation and not see a way out.\"\n\nHoge\u2019s acclaimed 2001 debut Carousel established himself as a masterful songwriter, performer and critical favorite. Rolling Stone compared him to Bob Seger and John Mellencamp, while NPR praised his \u201csharp, smart, passionate rock \u2018n\u2019 roll that seems to exist out of time.\u201d My American Dream is the follow-up to Hoge\u2019s 2017 album Anchors.\n\nMy American Dream Track Listing:\nGilded Walls\nStupid Kids\nStill A Southern Man\nOh Mr. Barnum\nThoughts & Prayers\nMy American Dream\nThe Illegal Line\nNikki\u2019s A Republican Now", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9198047.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: rock n roll country soul", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "The String Cheese Incident", "ArtistBio": "Over the past decade, The String Cheese Incident has emerged as one of America\u2019s most significant independent bands. Born in 1993 in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, SCI has since released 10 albums, 5 DVDs and countless live recordings from their relentless tour schedule. Their 14 year history is packed full of surreal experiences, epic moments, groundbreaking involvement and huge accomplishments. They have been recognized for their commitment to musical creativity and integrity, for their community spirit, philanthropic endeavors, and for their innovative approach to the business of music. When The String Cheese Incident\u2019s growth first started gaining momentum over a decade ago, the internet was just beginning to take hold and the major-label business model was failing; the band decided then to make music on their own terms. Since then, The String Cheese Incident has gone on to carve out a completely different approach to the business of music; they are truly pioneers of the new way of \u201cmaking a band.\u201d With the World Wide Web as their tool, SCI was among the first artists to disseminate information via the internet - such as tour dates, release information, and other news - to their growing fan base. Rather than doing business on such terms as \u201cthe bottom line,\u201d The String Cheese Incident put their music and their fans first, offering such fan services as ticketing, travel, and merchandise to best serve their community. The band\u2019s record label, SCI Fidelity Records, has always operated under the same ideals. Even early on, SCI Fidelity embraced downloadable music and file sharing, delivering SCI\u2019s \u201cOn the Road\u201d series, where every show the band plays is made available for download on the internet. Whether they realized it at the time or not, The String Cheese Incident was inventing grassroots band development. Today, literally thousands of bands are using some version of this same approach to building a band. The String Cheese Incident\u2019s commitment goes well beyond their immediate community, and even beyond the music community as a whole. Early on, the band took a serious interest in giving back to the communities that they visited, and they were among the first performers to encourage \u201cGreen\u201d shows and tours. SCI\u2019s support has helped give rise to such not-for-profit organizations as Conscious Alliance, Rock the Earth, and Head Count. In 2002, when the band\u2019s right to sell tickets to their own shows became threatened by ticketing giant Ticketmaster, the band stood strong for the independent music community and filed a lawsuit against the company. All the while, The String Cheese Incident has stayed committed to music as a creative endeavor, not just in their recordings but also in their live performances. The list of SCI\u2019s special guests and collaborators is long and diverse. Their annual events such as Horning\u2019s Hideout and holiday shows such as New Year\u2019s and Halloween have helped redefine the concert experience and has garnered the band a reputation as live music vibe innovators. \u266b ROOTS RUN DEEP \u266b", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6386811.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: Country, Jam, Rock, Bluegrass", "OtherInfo": "Doors open at 7pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Wednesday Sept. 18", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore"}, {"Address": "3301 Lyon St, San Francisco, CA 94123", "Artist": "Jake Shimabukuro", "ArtistBio": "Almost everyone in Hawaii has strummed a ukulele at one time or another. But at the age of 14, Jake Shimabukuro realized that he was doing something a little different with the four-stringed instrument \u2013 OK, a lot different.\n\nShimabukuro\u2019s wholly unique approach to the ukulele started early. As a youngster growing up in Honolulu, Hawaii, Shimabukuro started playing the instrument at the age of four, learning the basics from his mother, Carol, and then developing his craft further by studying the likes of musical masters such as Eddie Kamae, Ohta-San and Peter Moon. As he matured, Shimabukuro also found inspiration from guitar players, drummers, pianists, and singers. Even athletes helped fuel the intensity of his artistic fire.\n\nIn 2005, Shimabukuro\u2019s touring career really came to life with a video on YouTube. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what YouTube was at the time, so I was totally surprised when people started telling me they\u2019d seen a video of me playing \u2018While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBefore I got a chance to check it out myself, the video had gone viral and a lot of music industry folks seemed to know about it. It was crazy!\u201d Shimabukuro\u2019s deeply beautiful and original take on George Harrison\u2019s love ballad, one which captured colors and moods never associated with the ukulele before, opened the floodgates \u2013 now legions of new music lovers had to hear this instrumental marvel \u2013 and the 2006 release of Gently Weeps (produced by Mac McAnally), which mixed his own originals with equally adventurous versions of \u201cAve Maria\u201d and \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d was an unqualified success.\n\nShimabukuro\u2019s records have topped the Billboard World Music Charts on numerous occasions, and as a live performer he has become one of the hottest tickets around. He\u2019s played with world-renowned orchestras and at prestigious venues such as the Hollywood Bowl, Lincoln Center and the Sydney Opera House, and has dazzled audiences at music festivals including Bonnaroo, SXSW, the Playboy Jazz Festival and Fuji Rock Festival. He even performed for that rarest of audiences: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Not too shabby for a humble young man from Hawaii and his trusty ukulele.\n\nEven with the constant demands on his time \u2013 Shimabukuro tours roughly half the year and makes frequent appearances on media outlets such as The Today Show, Good Morning America, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Conan O\u2019Brien, A Prairie Home Companion and NPR\u2019s Morning Edition \u2013 Shimabukuro\u2019s album output hasn\u2019t slowed. In 2016, he recorded the all-original Nashville Sessions at Music City\u2019s famed Ronnie\u2019s Place studio with producer R.S. Field (Steve Earle, Webb Wilder) and the ace rhythm section of bassist Nolan Verner and drummer Evan Hutchings. And now he\u2019s returned to the same city and studio \u2013 and with the same gang, too (augmented by guitarist Dave Preston) \u2013 for his newest record, The Greatest Day, which will be released on August 31, 2018.\n\n\u201cI had such a great time working with R.S. Field on Nashville Sessions,\u201d Shimabukuro explains, \u201cand I knew I wanted to continue working with him on The Greatest Day. On the last record, it was pretty much the sound of a live trio, which sounded fresh, raw and organic. We were basically writing and improvising in the studio. Now we\u2019ve expanded to a quartet, which has added more colors and variety to the overall production. Once we recorded the live takes, we experimented with overdubs, and added horns, strings and keys, and other funky sounds. There are even some vocals on a few cuts.\u201d\n\nThe 12 tracks that comprise The Greatest Day feature some of Shimabukuro\u2019s most imaginative and adventuresome playing yet. Half of the album is devoted to originals, on which the instrumentalist reaches new heights of compositional distinction. And on the covers, Shimabukuro\u2019s prodigious skills allow him to achieve the impossible, transcending his material \u2013 no mean feat considering some of the classics and standards he\u2019s tackling.\n\nAmong the self-penned tunes, there\u2019s the blissed-out title track, so effervescent and airy that it transports the listener into the clouds. Shimabukuro wrote the song the night before going into the studio. Shimabukuro, Verner and Hutchings recorded their parts first. Later, Dave Preston added a joyous, Edge-like guitar riff that really finished the tune. \u201cIt came together so quickly,\u201d Shimabukuro says, \u201cand when I heard the final mix, I just thought, \u2018Wow, this has been the greatest day!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPangram\u201d has already turned heads in concert. Titled after a sentence that uses all the letters in the alphabet (\u201clike \u2018the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog\u2019\u201d), it\u2019s based on a chromatic scale that utilizes all the notes in the Western music scale. But even non-musicologists will ride happily along its rivers of cascading melodies and its pumping, rock-soul rhythms.\n\nAnother treasure is \u201cStraight A\u2019s,\u201d a carefree and vibrant ride guaranteed to lift spirits, on which Shimabukuro\u2019s soulful soloing recalls one of his influences, Carlos Santana. The song was inspired by the A string on the ukulele. \u201cI wanted to write something where the \u2018A\u2019 note could ring out through the entire song.\u201d\n\n\u201cMahalo John Wayne\u201d is a flat-out stunner, a delicate melody that transforms into a grand-scale cinematic symphony. Discussing its origins, Shimabukuro explains that his father\u2019s favorite actor is John Wayne (\u201cHe named me Jake after one of the Duke\u2019s characters, in the movie \u2018Big Jake\u2019\u201d), and that the two of them would often watch Westerns together. \u201cThose are some great memories of mine,\u201d he says, \u201cso, I\u2019m saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to John Wayne for my name in this song. In Hawaiian, \u2018mahalo\u2019 means \u2018thank you.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs always, Shimabukuro\u2019s playing has a wonderful quality to it \u2013 there\u2019s an innocence, as if each phrase feels new to him. This sense of discovery is abundant on his astonishing reinterpretations of songs such as the Beatles\u2019 \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d now re-imagined as a driving and insistent ballad, brimming with furious jazz chords and a spirited back-and-forth between Shimabukuro and dobro legend Jerry Douglas. \u201cIt was such an honor to have Jerry guest on the record,\u201d Shimabukuro says. \u201cHe was only going to play on one tune, but we had such a great time that he stayed and played on two more tracks. I hope we can do more together one day.\u201d\n\nThe two go toe to toe on Jimi Hendrix\u2019s freak-flag classic \u201cIf 6 Was 9,\u201d spiraling off into a spacey, jazz-rock odyssey that manages to be reverential to the original while simultaneously distinguishing itself as a bold new tour de force. Shimabukuro\u2019s wild wah-wah lines form transfixing sheets of sound, and he even pulls off a neat trick, varying some of his melodies to recall another Hendrix standard, \u201cLittle Wing.\u201d \u201cI wanted to throw in something unexpected, because that\u2019s what I felt like Hendrix would do.\u201d\n\nThe Zombies\u2019 psychedelic rock nugget \u201cTime of the Season\u201d was one Shimabukuro often heard in his house growing up, and on The Greatest Day he trips into nostalgia with an elegant rendition that features some of his smoothest, Wes Montgomery-like phrases. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to play this one for my parents,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as they heard it, they were like, \u2018Oh, wow! You covered the Zombies!\u2019 They thought that was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nThe Greatest Day concludes on a stately note, with a sparse yet exquisite reading of Leonard Cohen\u2019s iconic hymn \u201cHallelujah.\u201d Each line that Shimabukuro plays seeps into one\u2019s heart and soul, proving that music is indeed the universal balm. \u201cI had recorded it before, but after Cohen passed I wanted to re-record it \u2013 I felt a new emotional response to it. It seemed like the perfect way to end the album.\u201d\n\nOnly he didn\u2019t end it there: Shimabukuro was particularly excited about his playing on a recent round of dates with bassist Nolan Verner and guitarist Dave Preston. The addition of a guitarist allowed him to solo more expressively than ever before. The digital edition of The Greatest Day includes a beautiful live version of \u201cBlue Roses Falling\u201d that features Shimabukuro dueting with cellist Meena Cho as well as a concert recording of \u201cKawika\u201d (originally made famous by the Sunday Manoa).\n\nThe CD and vinyl versions of the album include both tracks along with three more cuts including immersive takes on \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d and Shimabukuro\u2019s own \u201cDragon,\u201d. There\u2019s even a slinky, ultra-funky interpretation of Bill Withers\u2019 hit single \u201cUse Me\u201d that sees Preston showing off his soulful vocal chops. They were recorded live with no overdubs at various venues by engineer Brett Lind and mixed by Jack Clarke (who engineered Nashville Sessions and The Greatest Day).\n\nShimabukuro has already been performing some of the material from The Greatest Day live, and he\u2019ll soon work more songs into his set. In mid-July, he embarks on an extensive tour of the U.S and a fall tour of Japan. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to play the new songs in my shows,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking this record was one of the highlights I\u2019ve had in the studio. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the sounds and arrangements. But most of all, we had a ton of fun making it.\u201d\n\nAlong with his tremendous professional achievements, Shimabukuro\u2019s personal life is filled with riches: He\u2019s a loving husband and proud father of two boys. While balancing career with family, he also remains firmly rooted in his commitment to community, frequently performing at schools in Hawaii and overseas, urging youngsters to find their passion and live drug-free.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8534039.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.448345, 37.802902], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: Instrumental, Acoustic, Pop", "OtherInfo": "Shimabukuro\u2019s busy touring schedule is complemented by a rich and varied catalog of albums that capture the many moods of the uke.", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Palace Of Fine Arts Theatre"}, {"Address": "1522 Francisco Blvd, Pacifica, CA 94044", "Artist": "Moxi & Loon", "ArtistBio": "Moxi & Loon are a high energy two-piece rock band based in San Diego CA.

To her, it's become a motto - a hopeful thought that carries her through rough days. \"I literally had to be dropped off at my write the day we wrote Diamonds, because my Bug had died. For good. I didn't know what I was gonna do. And so we just wrote what I was feeling that day. I say what I think and I write my life.\" No stranger to the Nashville struggle, her highs and lows can be heard in her music. Steele\u2019s lyrics touch on being a twenty-something girl who's not sure how she's going to pay her rent, wishing that she had things a little more figured out by now. She covers the ups and downs of love, victimizing her heart's counterpart on \"You Made It That Way\" (Steele/Terry McBride/Derrick Southerland), but keeps it light and fun with a road trip to Vegas in \"Getaway Car\" (Steele/Nathan Chapman). Steele also has a unique woman-to-woman perspective that gives a nod to her classic country heroes with songs \"Boyfriend\" and \"High Horse.\" Often compared to the likes of Sheryl Crow and Dolly Parton, this 5-foot-2 Leap Year baby isn't afraid to say what everybody else is thinking. \"Everybody's wanted something they can't have. We've all been there before. When we wrote \"Boyfriend\", (co-written with Raelynn and Nicolle Galyon), we wanted to come across as bold and honest with a touch of grace.\" High Horse (co-written with Ben Stennis and Brandon Hood), an ode to Steele's love of the Wild West, is a song about knocking an ambiguous enemy off of their \"Holier Than Thou\" throne. Steele grew up in a one-stoplight town in South Dakota. Although nobody in her immediate family was musical (her parents are both special education teachers), her love of music began early on. If the TV was on in the house, she was standing three feet away from it singing along with the videos on CMT. Her parents started taking her to concerts when she was young, and she grew up loving everything from Patsy Cline to Patty Loveless to The Eagles to Def Leppard. When she was just 10 years old, Steele opened for Loretta Lynn at a casino in South Dakota, where she befriended a Native American Chief named Dennis Alley. Soon after, Chief Alley began introducing her to all of his musical friends, including BB King, Aaron Neville, Waylon Jennings, and Willie Nelson. By the time she was 15, Willie was inviting Hailey to sing onstage with him during his finale. \"My experience with Willie will always be so special, but when I look back on it now that I'm older, it seems like it was almost spiritual. He\u2019s a huge part of my story.\" Steele\u2019s friendship with Willie and The Chief led her to many unique opportunities, such as performing at Farm Aid and singing a duet with Willie at the historic Corn Palace in Mitchell, SD. At age 19, Hailey moved to Nashville and began writing songs. One of her writing relationships led her to become part of the duo The LiNE, produced by Grammy-nominated songwriter Stephony Smith. The pair spent two seasons on a NASCAR tour, received the rare \u201cfour chair turn\u201d on Season 2 of The Voice (Team Xtina), and even had the honor of performing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. As soon as The Voice ended, Hailey decided to split from The LiNE and started to write for her solo project. \"Being in a duo was a great experience for me. We made a lot of friends and wrote a lot of songs, but at the end of the day I wanted to get back to what my message was, and why I came to Nashville.\" Not long after, Hailey had found herself surrounded by a community of talented artists, writers, producers, and believers. One of those believers was producer Paul \"Relli\" Barber. \"Relli and I had been talking about making a record for four or five years. Either the timing was never right, or we were too busy, or the money wasn't there. But he was always extra invested in the music. Over the course of our friendship, I'd sent him almost every song I'd written.\" One of those songs, \"Getaway Car,\" (co-written with Nathan Chapman) was almost forgotten. \"Getaway Car was on hold for another artist who was in pre-production at the time, so I kind of counted it out for myself. Within the hour that I found out they weren't going to cut it, Relli randomly sent my own demo of Getaway Car to me and said, \"Hey, What about this song?\" We both took it as a sign, and now that song is the first single.\" Another cut from the EP, \u201cYou Made It That Way,\u201d was co-written by Derrick Southerland and Terry McBride. \u201cWe had a write scheduled for February 28th, which is usually when I celebrate my birthday on off years. Normally I would take the day off, but I heard somebody say that it was good luck to work on your birthday. When I walked in, the boys were playing the opening riff of what turned out to be one of my favorite songs I\u2019ve ever written.\u201d McBride, a celebrated songwriter and founder of McBride and the Ride says of Hailey, \u201cI\u2019ve worked with a lot of upcoming artists over the last twenty years. Some you remember and some you forget. But some you just know they have what it takes to make it, and Hailey Steele falls into that category. She has the determination and talent to separate her from the rest of the pack, and a voice that leaves an impression on those who get the chance to hear her.\u201d When it came to the recording process, Relli and Hailey had the opportunity to make the EP in a way that was very unique to Nashville. \"We sat in a studio by ourselves for almost six weeks and came up with parts, and played most of it ourselves, \" Relli said. \"A lot of the arrangements were already there, and some of the parts were derived from Hailey's live band show.\" Once Relli and Hailey had exhausted all of their musical resources (Steele on acoustics, piano, and background vocals, Relli on acoustics, electrics, piano and drum programming), they called in some of their favorite musicians, including Doug Lancio (Patty Griffin), Adam Ollendorff (Kacey Musgraves), Shaun Balin, Jon Rogerson, and Matt Butler (Sheryl Crow). Steele says that this EP will give listeners the perfect idea of who she is, because if you know her songs, you know her. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be any happier with how this EP turned out. Every single note on this thing speaks for who I am as an artist. Now I\u2019m ready to get out there and share it with the world.\u201d Along with the release of her debut EP, Steele will be on tour this fall with singer/songwriter Stephen Kellogg. In 2013, she became the youngest member to be inducted into the South Dakota Country Hall of Fame.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8137465.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.516602, 37.968097], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: Country", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Terrapin Crossroads"}, {"Address": "406 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Matt Herrero", "ArtistBio": "Matt Herrero is a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, actor, and high-functioning procrastinator from the San Francisco Bay Area.

To read various descriptions from magazines and reviews, you might feel like you couldn't be reading about the same band. From chamber music to black metal to goth to jazz and avant-garde classical -- nothing really fits. Is Hubardo the \"true\" Kayo Dot? Is Coffins on Io? Choirs of the Eye? Does the question need an answer? Toby Driver, the primary composer and frontman for the band, has been fiercely productive over the years, and while that usually refers to how many songs or albums an artist has made, with Driver the productivity is in the realm of ideas as much as music itself. In the course of a single Kayo Dot song, the amount of risks and liberties taken with form and convention usually outnumbers what other artists cover in a full album. That's not to say Kayo Dot doesn't have an impressive catalog. Neither is the band jarring the listener from one absurd extreme to another just to prove a point. For as much ground as they cover, it's always in the service of a carefully curated mood. The core of Kayo Dot might be that mood, one that lies at the crossroads of darkness and mystery. In films, the music that accompanies mystery is almost always nocturnal, probably playing on some primal relation in our brains between the unknown and the night time. It's at this intersection that one is most likely to nail down what Kayo Dot is all about. Driver still collaborates with former maudlin of the Well bandmate Jason Byron, with Jason handling lyrical duties. Byron, who is a lifelong student of the occult, gives the listener a feast of words to unpack that are as elusively satisfying as the labyrinths of sound they travel through. Whether by way of menacing guitars, ethereal woodwinds, or alien electronics, there's always a sense that a new passage could open, that around the next corner could be anything: a beast or some figure of erotic desire. Kayo Dot have played the stages of Roadburn and SXSW. In 2015, Driver organized and played a month long, career-spanning residency at The Stone in New York. Kayo Dot records have appeared on labels as diverse and distinguished as Hydra Head, The Flenser, and John Zorn's Tzadik. With the release of 2016's Plastic House on Base of Sky, they take a decidedly electronic turn, incorporating a variety of synthesizers (many of them vintage analog) to create another work of ambition and magnitude that fuses the explosive musical imagination of a band like Magma with the forward-thinking experimentalism of Conrad Schnitzler or Morton Subotnick. Everything is fluid. The only constant is change. You can't step in the same river twice. Many people hold these truths to be self-evident. As these ideas become even more more commonplace, it only makes sense that musicians should defy the demand to answer the question \"Who are you?\" The refusal to answer is, in a way, the best answer possible. Kayo Dot is what that refusal sounds like. \u2013 Joshua Strawn \"This is what progressive rock really should be like, progressive in every sense... they are one of the very best bands out there.\" - OrganThing/ResonanceFM (London, UK) DO NOT SEND US MESSAGES ON FACEBOOK.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9416197.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.769989, 37.680587], "Date": "Thu Oct 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-03", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Monica's Livermore"}, {"Address": "1650 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132", "Artist": "Alvie & The Breakfast Pigs", "ArtistBio": "We're a loud and in your face rock n roll trash blues rock band shredding the mean streets of San Francisco.

While attending college, Tim began to experiment with guitar. He became especially fascinated with song-writing and recording. He began co-writing and recording and producing with the New Jersey based band Dog Show Blues. During this time he also worked on what would later become his debut album. Attributing much of his inspiration to his three older brothers, he named the solo project The Fourth Son. His debut album The Fourth Son EP was released in 2014. In the winter of 2015, The Fourth Son relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, and began developing a live presence. He played at open-mic nights throughout the Bay Area, while teaching elementary physical education by day. He released his second album titled Lavenia in 2016. With an increasing number of tour dates the project has developed a unique and powerful live sound.

Co-produced by Waldon and Dan Knobler, the collection opens with a confident anthem, \u201cAnyhow,\u201d which finds the Nashville-based songwriter forging ahead after some frustrating setbacks.\n\n\u201cThe past three years since we put a record out, we\u2019ve seen some of the biggest ups and downs, like exciting things happening, and not-so-exciting things happening. We kept going and it\u2019s all about that process,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the title alludes to things going on around us, in the world and in our environment. I do think there is a lot of white noise. That title describes where I\u2019m at.\u201d\n\nThe song \u201cWhite Noise, White Lines\u201d is inspired by a pivotal weekend in August 2017. While driving to see her family in her hometown of Monkey\u2019s Eyebrow, Kentucky, Waldon had an epiphany that everything was going to turn out all right. She\u2019d just turned 30 and had fallen in love again. A stunning solar eclipse that occurred directly over Nashville left her in awe. Meanwhile, during her visit home, she befriended a few members of the Chickasaw Tribe who were staying at her father\u2019s hunting lodge. Each of those experiences ended up in the song, including some tribal chants she recorded on her phone, added later with the tribe\u2019s blessing.\n\nSonic snapshots of Waldon\u2019s life are nestled into the album, without ever taking a listener out of the experience. For example, she dropped in a voicemail from her father, who\u2019d called to say he just heard her on the radio. Then she condenses her life story into four minutes with \u201cKentucky 1988,\u201d sharing some rough parts of her childhood but acknowledging that she wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. She draws on a historical battle in the Bluegrass State on \u201cBlack Patch,\u201d which is followed by a snippet of her friends playing and singing the bluegrass tune, \u201cRun Rabbit Run.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was on my birthday and we were having a picking party,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI wanted the record to feel personal and untainted. I also wanted to show that bluegrass is a huge part of everything about me.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Kentucky, Waldon took piano lessons but shifted to guitar when she was 12. Her mom bought her a 10-track recorder so she could start recording the songs she was writing. She nurtured her singing talent at county fairs and in church, then decided to move to Nashville at the age of 19 to pursue a music career. Overworked and broke, she moved back home after a year and enrolled in community college. After being accepted by Belmont University, she zeroed in on songwriting courses and became the first person in her family to earn a diploma.\n\nTo make ends meet, she spent three years working as a bartender at the Nashville Palace, but when a booking agency started getting her on the road regularly, she bought a van and hired a band \u2013 and she\u2019s been touring almost constantly since then. In 2016, she made her long-awaited debut on the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nThus, it\u2019s no surprise to hear Waldon singing \u201cRun Away,\u201d a traditional country weeper about falling for someone whose life is a wreck \u2013 even though a simmering arrangement on the following track, \u201cSunday\u2019s Children,\u201d gives that song an aura of empowerment. Waldon wrote \u201cVery Old Barton\u201d about binge drinking alone, with the hopeful message of getting through the highs and lows of life.\n\nA bold centerpiece of the album, Waldon offers an impassioned protest song with \u201cLived and Let Go.\u201d She explains, \u201cA lot of times, I tend to write because I have to make sense of the world around me. We\u2019re all here for such a short time and it seems so silly that we get angry about things that I think are very fleeting. It\u2019s a message of hope for all injustice to end and for our wounds to be healed. Overall, it\u2019s a message of unity for all people.\u201d\n\nThat surging emotion is evident in the way Waldon plays acoustic guitar on the track \u2013 as she does throughout the album. She notes, \u201cI\u2019m as influenced by Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan as anybody else, and all kinds of folk singers.\u201d\n\nThat affinity for all genres is especially clear when she lists her influences, from The Band and The Meters, to Hazel Dickens and Ralph Stanley, to Ann Peebles and Bill Withers, and all the country legends you can name.

After years of making DIY records in his basement, Seattle native Jones decided to hit the road and join up with producer Jesse Siebenberg (of Lucas Nelson and the Promise of the Real and Supertramp) in beautiful Ojai, California. Recorded at Brotheryn Studios with Siebenberg, Results Not Typical Part I features solid performances from drummer Joey Waronker (Beck, REM, Paul McCartney), bassist Johnathan Flaugher (Ryan Adams), bassist Gabe Noel (Afghan Whigs, Father John Misty), guitarist Jason Soda (Miranda Lee Richards), violinist Paul Cartwright (Father John Misty), pianist Dave Palmer (T-Bone Burnett), and pianist Aaron Embry (Willie Nelson, Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros). After years of wanting to make a record with a world class line up, it was finally happening.\n\nResults Not Typical Part I, Jones\u2019 second solo effort, is the result of advice given to \u201cpick a lane\u201d, or combining songs with a similar sound, theme and genre on one record. Ian sat down and worked on a central theme which started out as a basic chord progression and set of riffs. A majority of the songs from this project are just a theme and variation on those chords and riffs, or this \u201clane\u201d. Jones brought in a handful of previously written songs such as Rollin which is a song about his time spent touring, and Goodbyes Are The Hardest Words which is a song he penned prior to his move from Seattle to California in 1999. The first song written with this theme is Athens Smiles which is a story about a girl on tour from Athens GA, that Jones had played a show with a few years earlier. Even though the writing theme is consistent, Siebenberg was able to put the recording together in such a way that the songs flow into each other without sounding the same.\n\nIan had started this recording project in Seattle in 2015 but it got off to a rough start. \u201cIt seemed like I was just not supposed to make this record in Seattle\u201d Jones said. After consulting with a few friends in Seattle, Jones turned to his California music friends for advice. Santa Barbara native John Mooy suggested mutual friend and musical colleague Jesse Siebenberg, as he was taking some time off after having his new son. One thing led to another and the long-distance pre-production process began. On a brief west coast tour in 2016, Jones visited Ojai and Brotheryn studios and the schedule was set, songs selected and line up of players made final. A few months later over a long weekend, the tracks were cut live over a two-day period, and Results Not Typical Part I came to life. Over the next few months, overdubs were added and Seibenberg rounded out the sound with his additions.\n\nNo stranger to the recording studio, Results Not Typical Part I is Jones\u2019 second true professionally produced solo album. Having worked in many studios over the last 20 years including legendary Cello Studios in LA, and Avast and London Bridge in Seattle, Jones states \u201cI\u2019ve taken all the mistakes and lessons I\u2019ve learned in the studio over the years and put them to work on this project. It\u2019s been a long journey, but I feel I\u2019ve finally hit my stride\u201d. He adds, \u201cThis EP is the first half of what is going to be an amazing record. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the guys or the process and Jesse is truly amazing.\u201d Jones is looking forward to hitting the road in the spring of 2018 to support Results Not Typical Part I and complete the last 6 songs of the forthcoming LP Results Not Typical.", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.789231, 38.042165], "Date": "Thu Oct 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-03", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Alt-Country, Country, Folk Rock", "OtherInfo": "House concert.

An \u201cacoustic reimagining,\u201d if you will.\n\n\u201cWe started from scratch,\u201d he says, from the instrumentation to his vocals to a fresh understanding of the heartache and regret that underpinned those songs. \u201cThere are no recording elements carried over from that album. It\u2019s all brand-new.\u201d\n\nWoods ended up with The Other Way, his new album that brims with inspired interpretations of Both Ways that are intimate yet startling in their urgency.\n\nSet for release on May 3 on Meant Well, his latest release is a reminder of why the Canadian artist has become such a sought-after songwriter whose work has been recorded by Tim McGraw (\u201cPortland, Maine\u201d) and Lady Antebellum\u2019s Charles Kelley (\u201cLeaving Nashville\u201d), with Spotify streams approaching nearly 90 million. You\u2019ve always been able to hear and connect with Woods\u2019 words.\n\nBut an odd sensation washes over you when the varnish is wiped off of Woods\u2019 songs. Somehow the lyrics burrow with even greater resonance and then linger like little smoke rings. For a producer, Woods enlisted ace guitarist Todd Lombardo, who produced Woods\u2019 song \u201cPortland, Maine\u201d in 2015 and wrote and played most of the guitar parts on Kacey Musgraves\u2019 Grammy-winning Golden Hour.\n\nWoods gave Lombardo artistic license not only to change the chords and song structures but to overhaul the arrangements with acoustic instruments and Lombardo\u2019s luminous guitar work as the centerpiece.\n\n\u201cI think this album draws out the pain and the darkness of these songs,\u201d Lombardo says. \u201cThe record is about loss and failure and feeling like you fucked it up, and there\u2019s no mistaking that. You hear every single word \u2013 and feel it, too.\u201d\n\nComing on the heels of \u201cGo to Her,\u201d Woods\u2019 first song of 2019, The Other Way is so revelatory that it makes you wonder why he didn\u2019t try this approach sooner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been an interesting idea to me, especially when you\u2019re an artist like me who inherently disappoints some people anytime your sound gets bigger,\u201d Woods says. \u201cBut a really good song is a good song in any arrangement. It\u2019s like a beautiful hardwood floor.

A native of Leesburg, Florida, Croker is the grandson of the late great jazz trumpeter Doc Cheatham. He began playing trumpet around age 11 after hearing Cheatham play in New York City, and by his teens was studying music at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in Jacksonville, Florida. From 2003 to 2007, Croker attended the music conservatory at Oberlin College. While at Oberlin, he was mentored by legendary trumpeter and educator Donald Byrd. Also during this time, he earned the Presser Music Foundation Award, which funded his debut album, 2006's Fundamentals. After graduating Oberlin, Croker relocated to China, where he took up residency at Shanghai's House of Blues. His 2009 album, In the Tradition, paid tribute to Cheatham.\n\nIn 2013, Croker returned to the States and began work on his third solo album, the Dee Dee Bridgewater-produced Afro Physicist. Released in 2014 on OKeh/Sony Masterworks Records, the Echo Award nominated album found him branching out stylistically, weaving elements of funk, Latin jazz, and hip-hop into his sound. In 2016, he delivered Escape Velocity, which found him delving deeper into a genre-bending, spiritually enlightened, funk-influenced jazz sound.\n\nUpon the album\u2019s release, The Wall Street Journal heralded the album as \u201c timeless and of-the-moment\u201d.

Now, that is something very difficult to achieve.\u201d\n\nDionisio Jes\u00fas \"Chucho\" Vald\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, was born in a family of musicians in Quivic\u00e1n, Havana province, Cuba, October 9, 1941. His first teachers were his father, the pianist, composer and bandleader Ram\u00f3n \u201cBebo\u201d Vald\u00e9s, and his mother Pilar Rodr\u00edguez, who sang and played the piano.\n\nAt the age of three, Chucho already played at the piano, using both hands, in any key, melodies he heard on the radio. In fact, there is a famous anecdote that tells the story of Bebo tricking his friend, the late Israel \u201cCachao\u201d Lopez, about checking out, with his back to the player, \u201ca young North American pianist.\u201d Chucho was then four years old.\n\nAt the age of five, Chucho began to take lessons on piano, theory and solfege with maestro Oscar Mu\u00f1oz Boufartique. He continued his studies at the Conservatorio Municipal de M\u00fasica de la Habana, from which he graduated at 14. Chucho also took private lessons from Zenaida Romeu, Rosario Franco, Federico Smith and Leo Brouwer.\n\n\u201cAt home he played jazz: the music of Ellington, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller\u2019s band. I\u2019ve been privileged. Because Bebo was the piano player at the Tropicana I could see true legend of jazz in person. He took me to see Nat King Cole, Errol Garner and Sarah Vaughan when I was child studying music. You can\u2019t imagine the effect that had on my life! It was enormous! Magical!\nAt 15 Chucho formed his first jazz trio end in December 1958 he worked as a pianist at the Deauville and St. John hotels in Havana. In 1959, he debuted with the orchestra Sabor de Cuba, directed by his father, Bebo. That band accompanied the top singers of that era such as Rolando Laserie, Fernando \u00c1lvarez and P\u00edo Leyva.\n\n\u201cMy father taught me everything about Cuban music, South American music, jazz, and how to work with an orchestra,\u201d reminisces Chucho. \u201c He gave me the piano chair, and stayed on as director, so I could learn how to work under a conductor. We did our shows and a million other things with that orchestra, including accompanying shows at the Havana Hilton. I learned a lot there. He is my idol, \u201che pauses, then continues. \u201cI don\u00b4t say was, my idol. He is my idol. He was my teacher. He still is.\u201d\n\nChucho\u2019s family and professional life took a dramatic turn in 1960 when his father left to work in Mexico and from there he moved to Europe, where he eventually settled. Bebo Vald\u00e9s never returned to Cuba. (Father and son saw each other again 18 years later at Carnegie Hall, where Chucho was debuting in the United States with his group Irakere. The relationship was fully restored in 2000, when they met again to play a duet on Calle 54, a film about Latin jazz by Oscar winning Spanish director Fernando Trueba. The father and son reunion culminated, musically, in Juntos Para Siempre, a 2007 duet recording that won both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy. Bebo Vald\u00e9s died on March 22, 2013. He was 94.)\n\nIn the early \u201860s, Chucho worked as a pianist at the Teatro Mart\u00ed (1961), the Sal\u00f3n Internacional del Hotel Habana Riviera (1963) and the orchestra of the Teatro Musical de la Habana (1964-67). In 1967, and after a suggestion of his old teacher, the great guitarist, composer and director Leo Brouwer, Chucho organized his own combo.\n\nStill, that same year he joins the important Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, then directed by maestros Armando Romeu and Rafael Somavilla. While a member of the orchestra, Chucho revisited the idea of a small group and, in 1970, he appeared at the Jazz Jamboree in Poland leading his own quintet.\n\nIn 1972, after recording Jazz Bat\u00e1, an album featuring an unusual jazz trio comprising bassist Carlos del Puerto and singer and percussionist Oscar Vald\u00e9s on bat\u00e1 (the traditional hourglass shaped drums used in the ritual music of the Orishas), Chucho decided to enlarge the group adding brass and trap drums. That\u00b4s the genesis, in 1973, of Irakere, a small, Cuban-style big band that played an explosive mix of jazz, rock, classical music and traditional Cuban music, including Afro-Cuban religious music and instruments.\n\n\u201cThe ideas for the brass have to do with the work we did with the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, which was a great big band,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cI tried to imitate that with four horns -- two trumpets, a alto and a tenor sax -- and with just that try to have the sound of a big band. Of course when you have monster players like Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, [trumpeter] Jorge Varona and [saxophonist] Carlos Averhoff you can write anything you want and it will work.\u201d\nIrakere first made its mark internationally in Finland in 1976. But the following year, the band was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie in a visit to Havana on a jazz cruise that also included pianist Earl \u201cFatha\u201d Hines and saxophonist Stan Getz. In 1978 the producer Bruce Lundvall, then president of CBS, signed the band for the label. Irakere debuted, unannounced, as \u201csurprise guests,\u201d at Carnegie Hall as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. As fate would have it, the program that night also featured pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, two of Chucho\u2019s main influences.\n\nSelections from Irakere\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival comprised the repertory of Irakere (CBS) their debut recording in the United States. The album won a Grammy as Best Latin Recording in 1979.\n\nThe group went on to create an extraordinary body of work that includes great dance recordings such as Homenaje a Beny Mor\u00e9 (Pimienta, 1989) and Indestructible (Sony, 1997); explorations of Afro-Cuban religious music such as Babal\u00fa Ay\u00e9 (Bemb\u00e9, 1999) featuring the great Orisha music singer L\u00e1zaro Ros; as well as ambitious projects such as Tierra En Trance (Are\u00edto, 1983) and Misa Negra (Messidor, 1987)\n\nIrakere\u2019s lineup went through many changes over the years. Throughout, Chucho remained as the one, great constant. But success had its costs. Except for the remarkable solo outing Lucama (Mission, 1986), his talent as a pianist was largely out of sight, obscured by his other obligations with the band.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1997, Chucho won his second Grammy for his work on Habana (Verve) as a member of trumpeter Roy Hargrove\u2019s Crisol. The following year, while not completely leaving Irakere behind, Chucho started a parallel career as a solo player and quartet leader, looking for greater opportunities to explore and showcase his playing.\n\n\u201cTwenty five years with the same band is a long time,\u201d said Chucho at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to play solo and with a quartet for some time now. My work as a pianist and soloist gets diluted in Irakere. My job in the group is to be the composer, arranger and musical director and that\u2019s a completely different role.\u201d\n\nChucho stayed with Irakere until 2005.\n\nThe fruitful period that followed is highlighted by albums such as Solo Piano (Blue Note, 1991), Solo: Live in New York (Blue Note, 2001) and New Conceptions (Blue Note, 2003), as well as quartet recordings such as Bele Bele en La Habana (Blue Note, 1998), Briyumba Palo Congo (Blue Note, 1999) and Live at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note, 2000), capturing a performance that features Chucho\u2019s sister, singer Mayra Caridad Vald\u00e9s . The recording won a Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album.\n\nThere were also Grammy awards for the already mentioned Juntos Para Siempre (Calle 54, 2007), the duet recording with Bebo; and for Chucho\u2019s Steps (Comanche, 2010), featuring his new group, the Afro-Cuban Messengers .\n\nIn total, Chucho has won five Grammys and three Latin Grammys.\n\nIn 2012, Chucho reorganized his Afro-Cuban Messengers which currently feature Yaroldy Abreu, percussion, Dreiser Durruthy Bombal\u00e9 , bat\u00e1 drums and voice; Reinaldo Meli\u00e1n, trumpet, Gast\u00f3n Joya, bass and Rodney Barreto, drums.\n\nHis most recent production, Border-Free, is yet another expression of the continuing musical search and evolution of Chucho Vald\u00e9s as a pianist, composer, arranger and director.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9040181.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Thu Oct 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-03", "Genre": "Genres: Latin-Jazz", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "SFJAZZ Center - Miner Auditorium"}, {"Address": "1099 4th St F, San Rafael, CA 94901", "Artist": "KALIB", "ArtistBio": "Chucho Vald\u00e9s\nBio\n\n\nWinner of five GRAMMY\u00ae and three Latin GRAMMY\u00ae Awards, the Cuban pianist, composer and arranger Chucho Vald\u00e9s is the most influential figure in modern Afro-Cuban jazz.\n\nHis most recent work, Border-Free, features eight pieces -- all but one new originals -- and it\u2019s another example of Vald\u00e9s\u2019 musical pursuit, one in which the conventional limits of styles and traditions blur and disappear.

In 1959, he debuted with the orchestra Sabor de Cuba, directed by his father, Bebo. That band accompanied the top singers of that era such as Rolando Laserie, Fernando \u00c1lvarez and P\u00edo Leyva.\n\n\u201cMy father taught me everything about Cuban music, South American music, jazz, and how to work with an orchestra,\u201d reminisces Chucho. \u201c He gave me the piano chair, and stayed on as director, so I could learn how to work under a conductor. We did our shows and a million other things with that orchestra, including accompanying shows at the Havana Hilton. I learned a lot there. He is my idol, \u201che pauses, then continues. \u201cI don\u00b4t say was, my idol. He is my idol. He was my teacher. He still is.\u201d\n\nChucho\u2019s family and professional life took a dramatic turn in 1960 when his father left to work in Mexico and from there he moved to Europe, where he eventually settled. Bebo Vald\u00e9s never returned to Cuba. (Father and son saw each other again 18 years later at Carnegie Hall, where Chucho was debuting in the United States with his group Irakere. The relationship was fully restored in 2000, when they met again to play a duet on Calle 54, a film about Latin jazz by Oscar winning Spanish director Fernando Trueba. The father and son reunion culminated, musically, in Juntos Para Siempre, a 2007 duet recording that won both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy. Bebo Vald\u00e9s died on March 22, 2013. He was 94.)\n\nIn the early \u201860s, Chucho worked as a pianist at the Teatro Mart\u00ed (1961), the Sal\u00f3n Internacional del Hotel Habana Riviera (1963) and the orchestra of the Teatro Musical de la Habana (1964-67). In 1967, and after a suggestion of his old teacher, the great guitarist, composer and director Leo Brouwer, Chucho organized his own combo.\n\nStill, that same year he joins the important Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, then directed by maestros Armando Romeu and Rafael Somavilla. While a member of the orchestra, Chucho revisited the idea of a small group and, in 1970, he appeared at the Jazz Jamboree in Poland leading his own quintet.\n\nIn 1972, after recording Jazz Bat\u00e1, an album featuring an unusual jazz trio comprising bassist Carlos del Puerto and singer and percussionist Oscar Vald\u00e9s on bat\u00e1 (the traditional hourglass shaped drums used in the ritual music of the Orishas), Chucho decided to enlarge the group adding brass and trap drums. That\u00b4s the genesis, in 1973, of Irakere, a small, Cuban-style big band that played an explosive mix of jazz, rock, classical music and traditional Cuban music, including Afro-Cuban religious music and instruments.\n\n\u201cThe ideas for the brass have to do with the work we did with the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, which was a great big band,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cI tried to imitate that with four horns -- two trumpets, a alto and a tenor sax -- and with just that try to have the sound of a big band. Of course when you have monster players like Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, [trumpeter] Jorge Varona and [saxophonist] Carlos Averhoff you can write anything you want and it will work.\u201d\nIrakere first made its mark internationally in Finland in 1976. But the following year, the band was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie in a visit to Havana on a jazz cruise that also included pianist Earl \u201cFatha\u201d Hines and saxophonist Stan Getz. In 1978 the producer Bruce Lundvall, then president of CBS, signed the band for the label. Irakere debuted, unannounced, as \u201csurprise guests,\u201d at Carnegie Hall as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. As fate would have it, the program that night also featured pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, two of Chucho\u2019s main influences.\n\nSelections from Irakere\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival comprised the repertory of Irakere (CBS) their debut recording in the United States. The album won a Grammy as Best Latin Recording in 1979.\n\nThe group went on to create an extraordinary body of work that includes great dance recordings such as Homenaje a Beny Mor\u00e9 (Pimienta, 1989) and Indestructible (Sony, 1997); explorations of Afro-Cuban religious music such as Babal\u00fa Ay\u00e9 (Bemb\u00e9, 1999) featuring the great Orisha music singer L\u00e1zaro Ros; as well as ambitious projects such as Tierra En Trance (Are\u00edto, 1983) and Misa Negra (Messidor, 1987)\n\nIrakere\u2019s lineup went through many changes over the years. Throughout, Chucho remained as the one, great constant. But success had its costs. Except for the remarkable solo outing Lucama (Mission, 1986), his talent as a pianist was largely out of sight, obscured by his other obligations with the band.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1997, Chucho won his second Grammy for his work on Habana (Verve) as a member of trumpeter Roy Hargrove\u2019s Crisol. The following year, while not completely leaving Irakere behind, Chucho started a parallel career as a solo player and quartet leader, looking for greater opportunities to explore and showcase his playing.\n\n\u201cTwenty five years with the same band is a long time,\u201d said Chucho at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to play solo and with a quartet for some time now. My work as a pianist and soloist gets diluted in Irakere. My job in the group is to be the composer, arranger and musical director and that\u2019s a completely different role.\u201d\n\nChucho stayed with Irakere until 2005.\n\nThe fruitful period that followed is highlighted by albums such as Solo Piano (Blue Note, 1991), Solo: Live in New York (Blue Note, 2001) and New Conceptions (Blue Note, 2003), as well as quartet recordings such as Bele Bele en La Habana (Blue Note, 1998), Briyumba Palo Congo (Blue Note, 1999) and Live at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note, 2000), capturing a performance that features Chucho\u2019s sister, singer Mayra Caridad Vald\u00e9s . The recording won a Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album.\n\nThere were also Grammy awards for the already mentioned Juntos Para Siempre (Calle 54, 2007), the duet recording with Bebo; and for Chucho\u2019s Steps (Comanche, 2010), featuring his new group, the Afro-Cuban Messengers .\n\nIn total, Chucho has won five Grammys and three Latin Grammys.\n\nIn 2012, Chucho reorganized his Afro-Cuban Messengers which currently feature Yaroldy Abreu, percussion, Dreiser Durruthy Bombal\u00e9 , bat\u00e1 drums and voice; Reinaldo Meli\u00e1n, trumpet, Gast\u00f3n Joya, bass and Rodney Barreto, drums.\n\nHis most recent production, Border-Free, is yet another expression of the continuing musical search and evolution of Chucho Vald\u00e9s as a pianist, composer, arranger and director.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8905120.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.528077, 37.972862], "Date": "Thu Oct 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-03", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Incavo Wine Lounge & Collective"}, {"Address": "998 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Crying Time", "ArtistBio": "Honkytonk revisionists out of Oakland, Crying Time plays straight-up country and western music, from Bob Wills to Glen Campbell with whistle stops in between.

The five-piece started life in 2010 as a more-or-less straightforward hardcore punk act, but over the course of their first three albums \u2013 2013\u2019s I\u2019m Not Right, 2015\u2019s Bad Blood and 2017\u2019s Lucid Again \u2013 were steadily evolving and mutating their sound in whatever direction they felt like. It was always loud, but it became both more nuanced and more off-kilter. New record Nature/Nurture, which is released on April 12, sees the band continuing down that snaking path \u2013 it\u2019s 11 songs swerving right and left abruptly and unexpectedly, veering from frantic punk to slower, more nuanced and psychedelic-tinged rock. And while it might not always make sense, these songs still sound like Clowns; because when Clowns don\u2019t sound like Clowns, they actually do \u2013 a paradox that vocalist Stevie Williams is very much aware of.\n\n\u201cNature/Nurture is an amalgamation of our last three records, which we\u2019ve made over the last 6 or so years,\u201d he says. \u201cOur line-up has been a little bit fluid over the years, but this record is the band really coming to fruition with this line-up and with all the different sounds that we\u2019ve experimented with over the years \u2013 everywhere from super-adolescent punk rock to nine-minute long psych jams.\u201d\n\nNow completed by drummer and founding member Jake Laderman, bassist/vocalist Hanny J and guitarists Rod Goon and Will Robinson, Clowns have become something of a force to be reckoned with in recent years. When the band began, Williams says that his end goal was to one day sell out the Corner Hotel in Melbourne, a venue that was instrumental in his years growing up. That seemingly unachievable ambition from his teen years was ticked off the bucket list while touring Lucid Again. Then, in 2018, the band played in front of 56,000 people when they supported Foo Fighters in Melbourne and hit the stage at the world\u2019s biggest heavy music festival, Wacken Open Air. \u201cIt\u2019s all a little bit mind-blowing,\u201d laughs Williams, \u201cbecause at the end of 2017 I realized \u2018Holy shit, I\u2019ve actually done everything that I wanted to do!\u2019 \u201cAnd now this is my job and I can\u2019t escape it.

The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Dolly Parton, Neil Young, Willie Nelson, and Bruce Springsteen are just a few of the artists who have had their work re-imagined by Bettye.\nNow, in her 55th year in show business, she has been signed to Verve Records, and has recorded an album of all Bob Dylan songs.

Kurt was born in 1980, one of ten children, and raised in the city of brotherly love, Philadelphia. As a teenager, his bluegrass-loving father gifted him with a banjo, when what Kurt craved was a guitar \u2013 so he played it as if it were.\n\n\n\nBewitched by lo-fi figureheads like Beck, Pavement, and Smog, along with a love for classics like Petty, Creedence, and Neil Young, he recorded his first songs and self-distributed them on CD-R between 2003 and 2007. These were compiled on 2008\u2019s Constant Hitmaker and the 2009 mini-album God Is Saying This To You... The dreamy and psychedelic tangles of damaged but still-lyrical songcraft announced a major new artist wandering in from the hinterlands.\n\n\n\nThe Violators (then featuring Adam Granduciel, with whom Vile had co-founded The War On Drugs) debuted on the 2009 EP The Hunchback, coming into their own on Childish Prodigy, Vile\u2019s third album and his first for Matador. More violent, more vivid, more ecstatically \u2018rock\u2019 than anything in Vile\u2019s catalogue, the album was a righteous leap forward. The album that followed, the breakthrough Smoke Ring For My Halo, was more reflective, something sun-dappled and sexy in softly strung-out strums like \u201cPeeping Tomboy,\u201d the kindred flipside to barnstormers like \u201cFreak Train\u201d off the previous record.\n\n\n\nHis fifth album, Wakin On A Pretty Daze, is a 69-minute double LP and Kurt\u2019s defining statement to date.

In bringing the album to life, vocalist/guitarist Joey Burns and drummer John Convertino found a spiritual home in unusual surroundings\u2014not in Arizona, but on the Northern California coast in a home-turned-studio called the Panoramic House. Built from debris and shipyard-salvaged timber\u2014and dubbed \u201cThe Phantom Ship\u201d by the band\u2014the grandiose house and its edge-of-the-world-like ambience soon made their way into the songs. The specter of California also had a powerful effect: as both dream state and nightmare, its infinite duality is mirrored in the music, giving Calexico a new direction and new edge. With less polish and more grit than ever before, The Thread That Keeps Us both honors enduring traditions and reveals Calexico\u2019s confidence in songwriting, ultimately setting a whole new standard for the band.\n\nAs heard on the album\u2019s lead single and opening track, the drama of the landscape directly impacted the making of The Thread That Keeps Us. Driven by sing-song melody and galloping rhythms, \u201cEnd of the World with You\u201d discovers an unlikely romanticism in volatile times. With its lyrics illuminating \u201cLove in the age of the extremes,\u201d the track is the perfect intro to an album that endlessly explores the contrast between bright and dark, hope and fear.\n\nWorking with their longtime engineer Craig Schumacher, Calexico co-produced The Thread That Keeps Us, gathering musicians from across the globe to dream up an earthy yet expansive sound spiked with jagged guitar tones and flashes of distortion. \u201cThere\u2019s a little more chaos and noise in the mix than what we\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d Burns points out. Although that chaos has much to do with \u201cwhere we\u2019re at right now as a planet,\u201d it also echoes Calexico\u2019s dedication to constant experimentation. \u201cWhenever we\u2019re writing and we come up with something that feels too familiar, someone will end up saying, \u2018That feels good, but let\u2019s keep going and see what else we can uncover,\u2019\u201d Burns says. \u201cIt\u2019s been really important to the arc of this band\u2019s evolution for us to always keep on trying new things.\u201d\n\nLike \u201cEnd of the World with You,\u201d much of The Thread That Keeps Us captures the anxieties and unease of living in tumultuous times. But while the album draws a kinetic energy from all that uncertainty, its lyrics unfold with a literary nuance and sense of setting and character. \u201cInstead of writing straight-up protest songs, I want to tell stories,\u201d Burns says. Largely inspired by his wanderings around Northern California during the album\u2019s production, the narratives embedded in The Thread That Keeps Us reflect on displacement, transitory existence, and\u2014in Burns\u2019s words\u2014\u201creturning to your home after being gone for some time and seeing how things have changed, and maybe not in the best way.\u201d\n\nAs the exact embodiment of that theme, \u201cThrown to the Wild\u201d delivers one of the most mesmerizing moments on The Thread That Keeps Us. With its gritty but poetic storytelling, the song opens on a downtown bus station late at night, its sleepy rhythms and atmospheric haze intensifying the bleakness of the scene (sample lyric: \u201cHome\u2019s waiting like a motherless child\u201d). From there, \u201cThrown to the Wild\u201d slips into a glorious frenzy of hummed harmonies, sprawling guitar lines, and Jacob Valenzuela\u2019s sorrowful trumpet playing, the effect both hypnotic and jarring. \u201cWe wanted the second part of the song to just open into this sea of chaos,\u201d says Burns, adding: \u201cSometimes chaos can be a good thing.\u201d\n\nEclectic in sound and feeling, The Thread That Keeps Us also offers the measured fury of \u201cBridge to Nowhere,\u201d the triumphant grooves of the Spanish-sung \u201cFlores y Tamales,\u201d the meditative rhythms and jangly guitar riffs of \u201cAnother Space.\u201d On \u201cThe Town & Miss Lorraine,\u201d shimmering tones and delicate mandolin melodies play against the darkly cinematic mood of the lyrics (\u201cSliding into the sea/With cynicism and rum/Watching Miss Lorraine/Smoking alone with the moon\u201d). The most brutal track on The Thread That Keeps Us, \u201cDead in the Water\u201d builds a thrilling menace from its snarling guitar riffs, frantic piano rhythms, and piercing lyrics penned for what Burns describes as \u201cthe antagonist to the story of the album\u2014a kind of monster\u201d (\u201cDon\u2019t try to look away or stop me in my path/I make the law and I decree a new kind of wrath\u201d). And woven throughout The Thread That Keeps Us are a series of instrumental interludes, including the lilting folk of \u201cUnconditional Waltz\u201d and the dreamy psychedelia of \u201cSpinball.\u201d \u201cGoing into making the album, the only thing I really knew for sure was that I wanted there to be moments that felt free and spontaneous\u2014just these moments of no time, no lyrics, no agenda,\u201d says Burns.\n\nOne of the most stirring tracks on The Thread That Keeps Us, \u201cGirl in the Forest\u201d spins a gentle fable from its near despair over the state of the planet (\u201cWell the world was spinning so fast, nobody took the time\u201d). \u201cThat song wouldn\u2019t have been written unless I was sitting next to my daughter Twyla, who was humming along as I was making up this melody,\u201d says Burns. \u201cFor months we tried finishing the lyrics together; I was leading with this idea about environmentalism and protesters in the forest, and I thought there could be some sort of spirit who appears. And then my daughter told me, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s cool\u2014but maybe it\u2019s just a girl who\u2019s friends with all the animals.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith \u201cGirl in the Forest,\u201d The Thread That Keeps Us displays a sensibility that\u2019s long informed Calexico\u2019s songwriting: a transcendentalist infatuation with the wild beauty of nature, a fascination deepened during their time at Panoramic House. \u201cBeing up there on the mountain and taking walks on the shore, and even swimming in the cold water, we couldn\u2019t help but be inspired by nature,\u201d says Convertino. \u201cOur love for our earth, our home, and the future of our children came into focus even more, giving the inspiration and desire to give back something that\u2019s positive and beautiful and life-affirming.\u201d\n\nIn that life-affirming spirit, Calexico decided to end The Thread That Keeps Us with a moment of fragile optimism. Described by Burns as \u201ca love song for my kids,\u201d the piano-laced, sweetly swaying \u201cMusic Box\u201d speaks to preserving dreams in a troubled reality. \u201cRight now we\u2019re at the edge of another potential crisis unfolding, and it\u2019s haunting every night as you put your kids to sleep,\u201d says Burns. \u201cBut at the same time, you look into a child\u2019s eyes and you see something hopeful, even if they\u2019ve maybe heard little pieces of what\u2019s going on in the news. I think that\u2019s pretty much the case with this band: we still have hope, and we\u2019re still so excited to be making this music together.\u201d\n\n\nCALEXICO ARE: Joey Burns, John Convertino, Martin Wenk, Jacob Valenzuela, Sergio Mendoza, Jairo Zavala Ruiz, and Scott Colberg.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8209458.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.46415, 37.77366], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Country, Rock, Folk", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Golden Gate Park"}, {"Address": "3038 Fulton St., San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "The Pimps of Joytime", "ArtistBio": "Let\u2019s take it higher.\n\nAnyone familiar with the Pimps of Joytime live experience knows the feeling\u2014it\u2019s that moment when a deep bluesy groove morphs into a full-on EDM dance beat, or the sensation when the wide-eyed audience collectively elevates in sync with the band\u2019s tangible energy.\n\nOn Jukestone Paradise, the Pimps of Joytime raise the bar with swagger to spare, crafting ten cohesive songs that ring out like the soundtrack for a ride through the diverse Brooklyn neighborhood where their sound materialized. Pulling from lead guitarist and singer Brian J\u2019s deep discography of influences, the creation of Jukestone Paradise began a decade ago, when he penned anthems like \u201cSky\u201d and \u201cFreedom Dancer,\u201d all the way up to the album\u2019s studio recording sessions.\n\nYou might accurately call the Pimps of Joytime a \u2018post-genre\u2019 band; they\u2019re a group whose sound\u2014even within a single song\u2014mirrors the diversity of our era\u2019s musical tastes. \u201cIt\u2019s a sonic tapestry that\u2019s representative of this time and place that we live in,\u201d says Brian J.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Pimps excel, by mashing up \u201870s funk tones with modern dance beats, mixed with original samples creating their mosaic sound. For listeners weary of today\u2019s DJ culture but eager to dance with abandon, the Pimps of Joytime are the antidote.\n\n\u201cAt our core, the Pimps of Joytime are not just dance music,\u201d says Brian J of the band\u2019s three-part harmony attack. \u201cMy first vocal mentor was a doo-wop singer, so I have a long-time love affair with vocal harmonies.\u201d\n\nWith the release of Jukestone Paradise, the band makes official their solid touring lineup, featuring dual female vocalists and percussionists Mayteana Morales and Cole WilliamsX. And they\u2019re hitting the road hard, continuing a constant touring schedule that\u2019s already left prominent sets at festivals like Voodoo, Outside Lands, Bonnaroo and High Sierra in their wake.\n\nBehind the frontlines are bassist/keyboardist David Bailis and drummer John Staten, forming the rhythmic backbone of the Pimps\u2019 audible collage. And for Jukestone Paradise, they called in a few friends to lend their talents, including Ivan Neville, who lends New Orleans flavor to \u201cSky,\u201d and Rubblebucket\u2019s Alex Toth, who co-wrote the quirky and infectious \u201cDance Cardia.\u201d\n\nJust as Brooklyn has changed since the Pimps started, so has the band\u2019s sound. But as Williamsburg gentrifies, the Pimps of Joytime\u2019s diverse evolution keeps the neighborhood\u2019s spirit alive. That spirit goes into the Pimps\u2019 pot, over a soulful roux of rhythm and groove.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8867727.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.46415, 37.77366], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Funk, Soul, Dance, Pop", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Golden Gate Park"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "St. Paul and the Broken Bones", "ArtistBio": "Sea of Noise, the second full-length album by St. Paul and the Broken Bones, marks a quantum leap in sound and style for the high-voltage Birmingham, Alabama-based band.\n\nProduced by Paul Butler and recorded at Nashville\u2019s Sound Emporium, the group\u2019s sophomore effort features an expanded eight-piece lineup of the widely praised soul-based rock unit. Longtime members Paul Janeway (lead vocals), Jesse Phillips (bass, guitar), Browan Lollar (guitars), Andrew Lee (drums), Al Gamble (keyboards), and Allen Branstetter (trumpet) are joined by Jason Mingledorff (saxophone, clarinet, flute), and Chad Fisher (trombone).\n\nThe collection of new original songs is the group\u2019s first release on RECORDS, a joint venture of SONGS Publishing, winner of ASCAP\u2019s 2016 independent publisher of the year award, and veteran label executive Barry Weiss.\n\nSea of Noise is a successor to the Broken Bones\u2019 2013 debut album Half the City, which introduced the group\u2019s blazing mating of \u201860s soul fire \u2013 daubed with latter-day influences like Sly Stone, David Bowie, and Prince -- to Janeway\u2019s impassioned singing and writing. The new album witnesses a deepening and broadening of the unit\u2019s musical reach and lyrical concerns.\n\n\u201cIt felt like it happened organically,\u201d Janeway says of the band\u2019s development. \u201cWith the last record, it was like doing things with your hair on fire \u2013 going in, recording it live. There\u2019s a sense of urgency to having a record like that. We were only a band for about five months at that point. I didn\u2019t know my voice \u2013 I\u2019d never done this professionally. I was just learning more nuance, and about carrying a melody. You don\u2019t have to go for it 100% all the time. You can draw people in by giving and taking.\u201d\n\nJaneway says that he and his close musical associate Phillips began to ponder the direction of the band\u2019s second album a year and a half ago. \u201cIf we had been forced to go into a studio a year and a half ago, we probably would have done a better version of Half the City,\u201d he says. \u201cThere would have been nothing wrong with that. But we started evolving, or changing.\u201d\n\nWork began in earnest during last year\u2019s Coachella festival in California: \u201cWe rented a house in San Bernardino Valley National Park. The week in between the two weekends, we really started to hash things out. Then we rented out a very hot warehouse in Birmingham where we could write. And me and Jesse and a few of us would send stuff back and forth via Dropbox. That gave me the ability to work on harmonies on the vocals. I wanted to take it up a notch, in all realms.\u201d\n\nLooking to such inspirations as Tom Waits and Nick Cave, Janeway was intent on lifting his game as a songwriter on material for the second album. \u201cI\u2019m married to a woman with a masters in literature, and I can\u2019t show her lyrics unless I\u2019m pretty proud of \u2018em,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to sit and think about what I\u2019m saying \u2013 what do I want to say, is there anything to say? What\u2019s my perspective as this Southern kid who\u2019s watching the modern world and feeling very much like an alien in a lot of ways. This is more personal. If you\u2019re going to say something, say something, and don\u2019t waste your breath unless you feel like you\u2019re saying something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nJaneway adds that his reading of the book Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, played a role in the direction of the work: \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be an overly political record, but I feel it shows up a little bit on the album.\u201d\n\nWith a full complement of new songs in hand, St. Paul and the Broken Bones entered the studio with Butler, leader of the British band the Bees and producer of Devendra Banhart and Michael Kiwanuka.\n\n\u201cJesse was listening to one of his records and he said, \u2018Everything sounds great,\u2019\u201d Janeway recalls. \u201cIt sounded like a real record \u2013 everything had depth, and was expansive-sounding. Butler ended up being the guy that we wanted to use. Producer-wise, I think we knocked a home run. He is very meticulous.\u201d\n\nOn Sea of Noise, the band\u2019s brawny horn-driven sound is augmented \u2013 and displaced -- by the use of a string quartet and a vocal choir. The strings \u2013 recorded at Memphis\u2019 historic Sam Phillips Recording by engineer Jeff Powell \u2013 were arranged by Lester Snell, a veteran of Stax Records sessions by Isaac Hayes, Shirley Brown, Albert King, and the Staple Singers, among many others. Janeway says of Snell, \u201cHe did all these classic, great records in Memphis \u2013 he did the string arrangements on them. The strings, for us, supply a darker tone. Horns sometimes can\u2019t portray a certain darkness. We thought that would be the best option, instead of horn lines. We have songs on this record that don\u2019t have any horns at all.\u201d\n\nEmployed on \u201cCrumbling Light Posts,\u201d the recurring motif that appears three times on the album, Jason Clark and the Tennessee Mass Choir were recorded in another legendary Memphis facility. \u201cThe Stax Museum let us go in there after hours and record the choir,\u201d Janeway says, adding with a laugh. \u201cWe said, \u2018Well, hell, we\u2019re in Memphis, let\u2019s just see if they\u2019ll do it.\u2019 It was pretty neat, I\u2019m not gonna lie.\u201d\n\nHe says of the finished work, \u201cSea of Noise is not quite a full-blown concept record. It is focused in terms of subject matter \u2013 finding redemption and salvation and hope. \u2018Crumbling Light Posts\u2019 comes from an old Winston Churchill quote, in which he said England was a crumbling lighthouse in a sea of darkness. I always thought that was a really interesting concept \u2013 that we\u2019re falling anyway. In this day and age, it is the noise that has defined so many things. We\u2019re going to fall to it eventually, but for now we feel like our heads are above water. It felt anthemic.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s lyrical and emotional richness is heard loudly in stunning new compositions like \u201cBurning Rome\u201d (which Janeway describes as \u201ca letter to God, if I could write it\u201d) and the startling \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Woman,\u201d which knocks traditional soul music gender roles on their heads. Janeway says of the latter song, \u201cI wrote that with Jesse, and he said, \u2018If I can write that song, I can die a happy man, because I\u2019ve finally made something that I feel can stand up to my standards.\u2019\u201d\n\nSt. Paul and the Broken Bones, which toured extensively in the U.S. and Europe behind their debut album, will put their take-no-prisoners live show on the road this fall. Their most recent concert work included arena dates opening for the Rolling Stones in Atlanta and Buffalo. Some acts may have been daunted by such a task, but not this one.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty neat, it was pretty crazy,\u201d Janeway says. \u201cI love the Rolling Stones, but my train of thought it, you gotta try and blow \u2018em off the stage. And that\u2019s still my goal.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8757676.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, R&B, Rock n Roll", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "3038 Fulton St., San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Mary Gauthier", "ArtistBio": "\u201cWith songwriting as powerful as hers, there\u2019s no need to go looking for qualifiers.

In the full gospel church of her childhood, she played saxophone and drums and found her singing voice and a passion for music. Her first show was in Knoxville, TN, and then it was on to Minneapolis. Since then, she\u2019s been featured on NPR\u2019s \u201cFavorite Sessions,\u201d CMT, American Songwriter, the London Times, Paste Magazine and others.

Just being a person of color, a queer woman of color, for that matter, is freaking political. My focus, as far as this record, I guess it\u2019s really been psychological. I\u2019m really intrigued by the perseverance of the human spirit and the complexities and contradictions that we embody as human beings.\"\n\n\n\n\"Silhouette of Sirens is comprised of snapshots of memory, both lived and imagined. Not all of these tunes derive from this, which is why I say, \u2018both lived and imagined.' Some are love/sex/relationship-inspired, which in my opinion make the pain one might experience more bearable. In James Baldwin\u2019s essay, \u2018The Artist Struggle for Integrity,' he says, 'I tell you my pain so that I might relieve you of yours.'\"\n\n\n\nLight is a central character on Silhouette of Sirens. Even the title speaks to this push and pull between danger and safety, shadows and shiny lights, and the things we can reach out and touch as opposed to the things we only hear in the distance. \u201cWhat is even happening? One can only guess,\u201d Brown sings in the opening track \u201cDrive Slow,\u201d embracing an uncertainty and sense of wonder from the beginning of the record. By the third track, she\u2019s carrying us along with her on a journey inward. Like many masterful songwriters, she has the ability to make her stories feel intensely personal yet open-ended; even in \u201cCarried Away,\u201d it\u2019s hard to tell whether she\u2019s singing about a romantic rift, an abusive friendship, or the havoc that anxiety and depression can wreak on an unguarded mind. \" \u201cDon\u2019t leave me here all alone / For so long you\u2019ve been my light in the dark,\u201d Brown sings on the album\u2019s centerpiece, \u201cMy Stone,\u201d while the sexy, Prince-channeling acoustic funk jam \u201cWhisper\u201d beckons the listener to come closer, to dance with her in the dark, to \u201cwhisper in my ear all that you need.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about different types of heartbreak, and how one deals with it,\u201d Brown says of the album. \u201cAnd not the heartbreak of a coupled relationship; just living life, and the experiences that break your heart. There are these moments on the album where it\u2019s like, \u2018this is intense.' And then hopefully, there are moments where it\u2019s alleviated \u2014 as I feel like life is. Life is hard.

Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act.

As they listened through the APHC versions, Thile and Bartlett realized that, taken together, these songs could form an album-length narrative. Part of the story Thile found was autobiographical. Thanks for Listening represents perhaps the most direct and personal material Thile has ever recorded. It reflects the changes to his own peripatetic life as he assumes a new role as APHC host and, behind the scenes, as a new dad\u2014while continuing to play with his band Punch Brothers and collaborate with such artists as Brad Mehldau, Edgar Meyer, and Yo-Yo Ma. We learn what delights him (like the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series,) and what alarms him (the polarized state of our nation post-election). But Thile also tells a broader tale\u2014satirically, wistfully, frankly\u2014 about the divisions and disconnects plaguing America today, whether it\u2019s on social media or at the Thanksgiving table. The overarching theme, Thile realized, was about the art of listening\u2014the joys of it, the current difficulties of it, and the necessity of hearing what others have to say, not just the overwhelming desire to be heard.\n\nListening, or the lack thereof, figures prominently on several tracks: \u201cFeedback Loop\u201d lampoons the way social media filters out all but those one agrees with, while \u201cModern Friendship\u201d rues the way old pals can drift apart\u2014and suggests that maybe sharing a well-made night cap could help solve that. \u201cStanley Ann\u201d is a graceful imagining of what Barack Obama might have said to his late mom as he departed the White House in January. The deceptively cheerful \u201cFalsetto,\u201d on the other hand, is an all-too-kind speculation on how the current occupant of the White House might gracelessly scold an activist entertainer\u2014managing to insult the singer\u2019s \u201cgirly falsetto\u201d in the process.\n\n\u201cMy initial working title was Get It out on the Radio\u201d (the name of the song he performs at the end of each APHC episode). But the album pivoted away from the show and toward the listeners\u2014and not just to the listeners of Prairie Home but to anyone who listens to things. They are my heroes\u2014people who listen. I find myself all too often on the other side of the conversation, talking about what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s hard to maintain focus or give something enough attention to appreciate it. We\u2019re in a place where listening is a precious commodity. That\u2019s the theme that I noticed rising up, greater than \u2018here is what was happening last week\u2019 or \u2018here is the place we were.\u2019 It\u2019s a celebration of people who haven\u2019t switched off, despite being given every reason to do so.\u201d\n\nThe arrangements have an intimate, dream-like quality to them; the songs feel like reveries, not statements. Thile\u2019s voice is at times double- or triple-tracked, cossetted by subtle echo. He delivers vocal takes that are by turns wry and soulful, frequently deploying a lovely falsetto in an especially evocative way, more Beach Boys than bluegrass. The chorus of \u201cThank You, New York,\u201d performed with singer Gaby Moreno, is a vocal stand-out, a nose-thumbing good riddance to the turbulent year that was 2016 (and a nod to the resilience of New York City and its occupants). Thile\u2019s mandolin playing remains front and center\u2014and it the sole instrument on \u201cBalboa\u201d \u2014but it is often bolstered by Bartlett\u2019s subtle, slightly mysterious, layering of keyboards and electronics.\n\n\u201cI was deeply desirous of a record that sounded like it was coming from your own head. That\u2019s where we veered away from a more archival studio approach\u2014where you go in, perform the songs, and record exactly how those performances sounded,\u201d Thile says. \u201cThe recordings on Thank You for Listening are more fanciful in construction.\n\n\u201cOftentimes I would be at the big room of Reservoir Studios making maps of these songs with whatever stringed instruments seemed appropriate and singing scratch vocals. Then Thomas would take them into his little room and start experimenting on them. And I would start the next map,\u201d he continues. \u201cI would get my pass by having written the song and having created a keep-able demo of the song and then Thomas would get his pass without me looking over his shoulder, telling him \u2018that\u2019s not how it goes.\u2019 Which I\u2019m unable to not do if I\u2019m in the room. It was like an editor editing a novel.\u201d\n\nLike Thile, multi-instrumentalist Bartlett is a musical polymath, comfortable in diverse collaborative situations. He often sits in with the National; he plays piano in the Irish Music group The Gloaming; and he occasionally performs on his own under the Doveman moniker. Rather than enlisting a full APHC-style band in the studio, the pair conceived the project largely as a musical dialogue between them\u2014a listening session of their own, if you will.\n\nThile manned all the stringed instruments, save for bass (from Alan Hampton) and viola (from Nadia Sirota, on the title track). Ted Poor\u2014like Hampton, a member of Andrew Bird\u2019s touring band\u2014played drums on five tracks. Bartlett provided, in Thile\u2019s words, \u201cwhatever sounds weren\u2019t accounted for.\u201d Thile also invited three guest singers to the sessions, all of whom had performed multiple times on APHC: Sarah Jarosz, Gaby Mereno, and Aoife O\u2019 Donovan. He says, \u201cAll three had made really meaningful contributions to how the songs ended up expressing themselves. That goes for all the musicians who played on this last APHC season. They all made such meaningful contributions to these songs. I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d\n\nThe original \u201cSong of the Week\u201d versions can be easily accessed via YouTube, now that all the APHC shows are live-streamed and subsequently archived. The performances are full of personality and humor, as Thile, a dependably energetic live performer, interacts with a roster of players that include various Punch Brothers, brilliant guitarist Julian Lage, and Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek. Contrasting these versions with the new studio recordings, one can appreciate the sort of magical transformation that took place at Reservoir Studios, one that was more about inspiration than analysis.\n\nThe process effected a transformation on Thile too: \u201cBefore hosting Prairie Home, I would listen to music much the way an athlete trains. Listening was like hitting the gym, like a pitcher strengthening his rotator cuff. I was listening to improve specific aspects of my musicianship or nourish it in specific ways. The hosting has brought me back into being a music lover, just listening with the idea of enjoying the three to five minutes of a performance, not worrying about whether it\u2019s rendering my sense of counterpoint more sophisticated or increasing my knowledge of how sonata form works or giving me more arrows in my improvisational quiver.\u201d He continues, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u2018do I like this? Is my life better since listening to this song?\u2019 That\u2019s what I care about now.\n\n\u201cI think that development led me to ask Thomas to produce Thanks for Listening,\u201d Thile concludes. \u201cHe and I have stayed up late drinking Amaro and listening to records. I often hold vast amounts of myself back to analyze things and Thomas would consistently play me things that would disarm that side of me. I was yearning to make a set of music that maybe hits more of those marks, to have some of that rub off on me. I hope I succeeded with Thanks for Listening.\u201d\n\n\u2014Michael Hill", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8293069.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Country, Bluegrass", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Hyde", "ArtistBio": "HYDE, Japan's most prolific rock artist, is the lead vocalist for L'Arc~en~Ciel, VAMPS, and most recently his own band by the same name, HYDE.

That's the voice of Latin Grammy Award Nominee Andy Alemany.\n\nA native of Buffalo, NY and with well-established latin roots, his life was always tied to ministry. During his adolescence his parents were youth pastors and little by little he became involved in music and within his church. He was later given the opportunity to join SOG (Sounds of Glory), his first true band experience, which paved the way to becoming one of the most sought out background vocalist for different musical genre\u2019s and ministries.\n\nFor more than a decade he was part of Ricardo S\u00e1nchez's vocal team. A season where he grew as a worship leader and where he had the opportunity to share the stage and sing background vocals not only with Ricardo but with artists such as Israel Houghton, Kim Walker, Danny Gookey, Montell Jordan, Danilo Montero and Lucia Parker, among others.\n\nBy 2016, after months of strategic planning and working on his musical production, since going by the way of worship would have been the easiest, he decided to take his style to another level. A level where his songs could be accessible to all and empathically focus on his contemporary pop message of worship, something that goes beyond music. From His experiences is where his first single \u201cEres,\u201d was born. It was received with much enthusiasm in the Latin market. It positioned itself in the top rankings, which set the bar for his spanish EP \u201cTu Primero\u201d which was released in May of 2018. Since it\u2019s release, Andy\u2019\u2019s been nominated for a Latin Grammy in the category of \u201cBest contemporary christian album in spanish,\u201d He\u2019s also won Male Vocalist of Year at Premios Redencion and just recently was nominated for 6 Premios Arpas.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9154746.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Latin Pop, Contemporary Christian, Latin, Pop, Christian Pop, Praise Worship", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "San Francisco"}]
