In 2008 he met Gallina Tamburo, who was on her own journey of healing. Their shared love of ecstatic music, kundalini yoga, the gong, sound therapy, and sacred chanting set the foundation of their relationship, marriage and eventual musical collaboration. In addition to completing their Kundalini Teacher Training at the mother ashram in Espanola, NM and Yoga For Youth Training with Krishna Kaur they have studied with Gongmasters Don Conreaux and Sotantar.

Early in Tamburo's career he gained notoriety for his string playing (hammered dulcimer, guitar and shahi baaja). In many of his early performances he began to enter into altered states of consciousness and have out of body experiences while performing. In order to understand these experiences he went into years of self study; exploring Kundalini Yoga, energy work, the therapeutic use of sound and how sound effects consciousness, human perception and self healing. His love for long sustained drones, overtones and psychoacoustics led him to working with multiple gongs and other tuned metal instruments (bells, sound plates, singing bowls) as well as exploring the healing power of mantra and toning.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Blades\n\n\u201cThe breadth of what we do is so wide we don't have to think about it,\u201d says longtime Bay Area drummer Scott Amendola, when talking about fellow local organist Wil Blades--the other half of the dynamic music duo known as Amendola vs. Blades. \u201cThe cool thing is we can play swingin\u2019 old school jazz, funk and rock, African music, to playing free.\u201d Such dynamic range would prove challenging for any band, let alone one consisting merely of eight limbs, two analog keyboards and a drum kit. But it\u2019s a challenge the two friends have eagerly met gig after gig since their auspicious first show together, a performance of Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite\u201d as an organ and drums arrangement, ten years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s all about keeping it fresh,\u201dadds Amendola. \u201cAnd keeping the audience engaged.\u201d And keeping audiences sonically freshened and engaged throughout their ever-evolving decade-long stint hasn\u2019t been a problem for this uncanny duo, who\u2019ve imprinted plenty of nondescript juke joints: the High Sierra Music Festival, SF Jazz, and the iconic Fillmore, alike with their slithery sound, enough to make stalwart critics like the SF Chronicle\u2019s Joel Selvin squawk: \"As for Wil Blades and Scott Amendola, these two Young Turks of the San Francisco jazz scene are bringing the organ-drum duo into the 21st century.\" And during this century, if you wanted to experience Amendola vs. Blades, you\u2019d have to be one of the many thousands who\u2019ve steadily showed up at one of their live duo adventures. Sure, you may have seen and/or heard these two in-demand session players as bandleaders in their own right, or as distinguished sidemen with the likes of Nels Cline, Charlie Hunter, John Zorn, Mike Patton, John Scofield, Idris Muhammad, Bernard Purdie, or Dr. Lonnie Smith. But if you wanted an album of just the two of them facing off as they do, literally on stage--you\u2019d have to wait. Until now. Finally, Scott Amendola and Wil Blades bring us their long-anticipated debut album\u2014Greatest Hits\u2014on Sazi Records. Recorded over two nights in front of an intimate audience in a downtown Oakland club in June of last year, Greatest Hits is comprised of seven originals, tunes that had initially been composed and recorded by Scott and Wil for other projects. Depending who you ask, the album title could perhaps be construed as a mini-sampler of what\u2019s to come, or perhaps a facetious statement of what was. The germ for the album took shape nearly two years ago. Adds Scott, \u201cWe always talked about it, but our schedules never lined up due to both of us being heavily on the road. As other projects ended, we actually had time to take it seriously.\u201dBlades adds, \u201cThe thing about live recording was double-fold. For us playing as a duo is very loose and fun, so the best way to capture that was live--the vibe of a studio can make you feel restrained under pressure. A loose gig is a better representation of how we play our stuff, which is improvising.\u201dOn Greatest Hits, such improvisation creatively steers the duo through a scenic tour of music genres, as each artist pushes and pull the other toward unanticipated discovery, all the while powered by the heavy grooves laid down by Blades\u2019 mastery of the Hammond organ, and Hohner Clavinet, and anchored by Amendola\u2019s rhythmic drum array. \u201cMost organ players are piano players first,\n\norgan players second. But Wil\u2019s the opposite. His relationship to the organ is deeper than anyone I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d, say Amendola. In addition to Hammond organ, (and requisite Leslie speaker), Blades doubles his keyboard arsenal with the distinct sound of a Clavinet, one he spent a summer tediously restoring. \u201cIt literally has my blood, sweat and tears in it,\u201d laughs Wil. \u201cIt opens up more sonic possibilities, and just adds another color texture to the mix.\u201dThe seven tunes on Greatest Hits impresses with its own set of colors and textures. From the fast boogaloo of \u201cLima Bean,\u201d to the New Orleans 2nd line vibe of \u201c32nd St.\u201d, and \u201cSlow Zig,\u201d (a tribute to Meters legend Zigaboo Modeliste); the complex 6/8 rhythms of the Ethiopian-inspired \u201cAddis\u201d, to the afrobeat-centric homage via \u201cOladipo\u201d, to Fela\u2019s right (and left) hand man, wunderkind drummer Tony Allen; or from the soulful songs dedicated to their respective daughters in \u201cDeep Eyes\u201d, and \u201cMae Mae.\u201dIt\u2019s a range Amendola vs. Blades is uniquely suited to express. \u201cI like playing tunes,\u201d the drummer says. \u201cI like the idea of there being a structure to launch from, and being a duo means there are a lot of possibilities harmonically and rhythmically. Neither one of us knows what we are gonna do, and that is exciting both for us, and the audience.\u201d\n\nPress\n\n\"The Amendola vs Blades duo has firmly established itself as one of the liveliest acts in the Bay Area.\"\n- Jazz Observer\n\n\u201cSometimes it just ridiculous how much sonic space Scott Amendola and Wil Blades alone can fill up in a room.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. He\u2019s never more than one degree away from a powerful musical hook-up.", "otherInfo": "Scott Amendola-drums/electronics/percussion, Wil Blades-Hammond B3/ Clavinet.

As the Truth or Consequences, NM-based \u2018Harmonic Alternative Folk\u2019 duo Flagship Romance they live, work, and annually travel tens of thousands of miles together, deeply in love with each other and the process of bringing their emotionally powerful music to the people. It is an inspiring union of hearts, minds and souls that entrances all who encounter them and their art.\n\n\"Their songs & vocals have a simmering intensity... I also suspect Fisher used to play in rock bands, as he tended to attack his guitar with an unbridled ferociousness.\" - Mayer Danzig // Twangville\n\nFluent, intense acoustic guitar playing; lyrics of life\u2019s peaks, troughs, mysteries and wonders; soaring, yearning vocals; tender, though oft-anthemic melodies, and harmonies one could barely separate with a single human hair: this is the Flagship Romance sound. Live, sharing a custom-built dual microphone stand, they deliver their beautiful material with passionate abandon, living each song as if it will be the last they will ever perform. Such commitment to their music and stagecraft has, in just a few short years, seen the aptly-monikered Flagship Romance become huge favourites of the North American house concert circuit. This suits them just fine, as Shawn and Jordyn\u2019s preferred performance scenario is an intimate venue where the audience is tucked up close enough to them that they can hear them breathe (and, unfailingly, gasp at Shawn and Jordyn\u2019s chemistry and dynamics). Yet they have also appeared at festivals, clubs and concert halls, sharing stages with international acts including Half Moon Run, Iris DeMent, Mason Jennings and the Goo Goo Dolls.\n\nFlagship Romance are on the road for upwards of eight months a year, and have been pretty much since the release of their 2013 debut EP, The Fudge Sessions. If ever a testament to this extraordinary work ethic were needed, it would be the reaction to the crowdfunding campaign they launched to finance their 2014 full-length debut, an ambitious and ultimately stunning CD/DVD project entitled Fee Fie Foh Fum. Recorded live off the floor \u2013 difficult to comprehend considering its quality \u2013 the album captures the bristling energy of Flagship Romance live shows, and was created with the considerable backing of the duo\u2019s rapidly burgeoning legion of fans, to the tune of over $25,000.\n\nOn the back of such a successful project, one that emphatically delivered on their promises, a sophomore full-length was hotly anticipated. Lo and behold, another overwhelmingly positive Kickstarter campaign ensured that Flagship Romance could craft 2017\u2019s Tales from the Self-Help Section exactly as they wished to, employing a subtly richer sound and new vocal approaches by Jordyn. Produced by Lucio Rubino at The Fish Tank Recordings in St. Augustine, FL, Tales from the Self-Help Section is a personal, largely self-examining and emotional 12-song opus, documenting \u201cthe little victories, failures and lessons\u201d Shawn and Jordyn have experienced during the last couple of years, \u201cmostly dealing with the battles of \u2018being present,\u2019 and living with depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nOn the evidence of their gorgeous work to date it is clear that the love and skill of which John Ruskin spoke intertwine in perfect harmony in the cases of Shawn Fisher and Jordyn Jackson, and that, indeed, little masterpieces are the results. Yes, Ruskin would have loved Flagship Romance.\n\n......\n\nFlagship Romance has aligned their musical career with the clean water cause via the organization charity: water. In August 2012, Fisher and Jackson founded and organized the Clean Water Music Fest in Florida, to raise funding and awareness for the 800 million people on this planet without access to safe, clean drinking water. Since then, they have raised over $125,000; 100% of that money is currently being used for well building and tap-stand projects in Ethiopia, Rwanda, and the Sahel region of Africa.\n\nBiography by David Morrison, Folk Radio UK", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1628 Webster St, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Mike Eshaq", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9340614.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267487, 37.805321], "Date": "Sat Nov 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-02", "Genre": "Genres: Standup Comedy", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Spice Monkey Restaurant & Bar", "moreBioInfo": "After a tour in the Marines as a trained killer - Mike Eshaq never got to kill anyone!

I felt like my heart was breaking into a million pieces and I was losing everything all at once. I couldn't stop crying so I poured out all of my emotions and wrote a song.

The album\u2019s nine songs report back from the rich incubator that is the road, with pieces written from snippets recorded at soundchecks, gigs and jam sessions\u2014field recordings of the jazz trio in its natural habitat. On his first full trio outing, Blades is joined by guitarist Jeff Parker (Tortoise, Joey DeFrancesco, Joshua Redman) and drummer Simon Lott (Charlie Hunter, Will Bernard), both musicians who share Blades\u2019 grounding in tradition and urge to push it forward.\n\n\u201cBoth those guys can play straight-ahead jazz, they can funk, they can take it out, they can go in so many different directions,\u201d Blades says. \u201cI always had the idea in my mind that doing a trio with Jeff Parker and Simon Lott would have a cool vibe and would be very open.\u201d\n\nField Notes takes full advantage of that versatility and openness, exploring the full breadth of the organ trio\u2019s potential. \u201cOn this record, I was definitely trying to come out of the lineage but then trying to look forward at the same time,\u201d Blades says. \u201cMy whole thing is having a foot in the past and trying to have a foot in the future and to bring those two worlds together as much as possible.\u201d\n\nAt the outset of the album, Blades is dubbed \u201cthe magnificent, wonderful, sometimes tragic Wil Blades\u201d by a critic whose opinion is almost as important as Dr. Lonnie\u2019s: Blades\u2019 eight-year-old daughter, whose grandiose introduction of her father was captured while she was \u201chopped up on sugar and saying crazy, hilarious stuff.\u201d That intro showcases Blades\u2019 sense of humor, setting a warm, genial tone that carries throughout the CD\u2019s many moods. Her pronouncement leads directly into the shuffling blues of \u201cMiller\u2019s Time.\u201d The blues is a deep vein that runs through the entire album, straight through to the classic \u201cI Get the Blues When It Rains,\u201d which closes the album on a note of New Orleans soul.\n\nThat influence harkens back to Blades\u2019 roots in Chicago, where he grew up playing drums and guitar in rock and funk bands. He moved west to study jazz at the New College of California, where he studied with bassist Herbie Lewis. \u201cIt was a real old school jazz education,\u201d Blades recalls. \u201cWith Herbie, it was almost a Mr. Miyagi thing, life lessons where I\u2019d be wondering, \u2018Why am I cleaning the music room right now?\u2019 But as I got older I started to appreciate these fundamental, basic lessons that were actually very deep and useful, more so than what scale to play over what chord.\u201d\n\n\n\nBlades had begun adding the organ to his repertoire at the time, and it was Lewis who pressured him to choose one instrument to focus on. He had discovered the instrument through rock records by the likes of Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix, which led him to Jimmy Smith and other jazz innovators. At the same time, Medeski Martin and Wood had emerged with a new, more radical approach to the organ trio, which Blades found equally intriguing. \u201cSomething about the sound of the organ really turned me on,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was just something about it that I really dug, and I can\u2019t really explain it.\u201d\n\nOver the past fifteen years, Blades has grown to be one of the most in-demand organ players on the Bay Area scene. In addition to leading his own trio, he works regularly in duo situations with drummers Billy Martin (Medeski Martin and Wood) and Scott Amendola (Nels Cline Singers); and in trios led by guitarist Will Bernard and drummer Stanton Moore. He\u2019s performed and recorded with a host of jazz and blues greats including Melvin Sparks, Idris Muhammad, Joe Louis Walker, Don Braden, Donald Harrison, Nicholas Payton, Karl Denson, Charlie Hunter, Jason Marsalis, Herlin Riley, and many others.\n\nNot long after Blades\u2019 arrival in California, Dr. Lonnie Smith came to town to play a week of shows at the renowned club Yoshi\u2019s with fellow organ great Jimmy McGriff. \u201cI went to every single set,\u201d Blades says. \u201cThe music was so soulful, it was addictive.\u201d Finally mustering the nerve to approach Dr. Lonnie, Blades found an eager mentor; the two continue to play duo shows to this day.\n\n\u201cA lot of older guys really want the music to be carried on, and the old school method was not jazz college, it was mentorship,\u201d Blades says. \u201cLonnie has really taken me under his wing. It\u2019s always an amazing experience to get to play with him; he really is one of my heroes.\u201d\n\nThose lessons have paid off stunningly well, as evidenced in Blades\u2019 scintillating and soulful playing throughout Field Notes, whether on the soul-into-psychedelia shimmer of \u201cChrome\u201d (developed from an improvisation with Billy Martin) or the blues-meets-electric-Miles groove of \u201cDewey\u201d or the African rhythmic accents of \u201cAddis,\u201d inspired by a 2011 trek to Ethiopia, where Blades got to work with local musicians. Stylistically, the album ranges from the alluring balladry of \u201cForgetful\u201d to the smooth, slinky R&B of \u201cRed Lanterns Are Blue,\u201d which draws inspiration from J Dilla and Patrice Rushen.\n\nWhile he wrote most of the album with his bandmates in mind, often building on fragments from jams and improvs grabbed by his iPhone, Blades pays specific tribute to both of his sidemen on a pair of tracks. \u201c(I Can\u2019t Stand) The Whole Lott of You\u201d was named for an inside joke and is another unwitting contribution from Dr. Lonnie, who intoned the title in a mock English accent upon meeting Simon Lott. The title can be (and occasionally is) sung to the tune\u2019s catchy funk chorus.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\n\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\n\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\n\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers.

Her style fuses influences from the Isle of Skye and Cape Breton Island with Americana grooves and musical innovations, creating a cutting-edge acoustic sound that retains the integrity and spirit of the Scottish tradition. Hanneke\u2019s music is a blend of the contemporary and traditional, described by the Boston Globe as \u201cexuberant and rhythmic, somehow wild and innocent, delivered with captivating melodic clarity and an irresistible playfulness.\u201d\n\nA prolific composer, Hanneke writes music from personal experiences of love and loss as well as to commemorate the joys and sorrows in the lives of loved ones. Hanneke\u2019s latest release, Trip to Walden Pond, features traditional Scottish and Cape Breton tunes and seventeen new pieces composed in the Scottish idiom. While her lively style is very much evident, this new album carries a deep, soulful sound with songs of celebration and farewell. Produced by Finnish musician Antti J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 (FRIGG, JPP, Baltic Crossing), the album showcases long-time musical collaborators cellist Mike Block, guitarists Keith Murphy and Christopher Lewis, fiddler/violist Jeremy Kittel, and pianist Dave Wiesler. Antti J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 contributes guitar and piano to a couple of tracks and piper Samppa Saarinen is featured on the uilleann pipes. Trip to Walden Pond, similar to Hanneke\u2019s five previous albums, offers mellifluous arrangements of traditional fiddle music and original tunes that evoke humor and heart. This latest album also includes several compositions penned by Hanneke as commissions to benefit Many Hopes, a children\u2019s education nonprofit based in Kenya that she avidly supports.\n\nA native of Port Orford, Oregon, Hanneke started out as a Texas-style fiddler and went on to win the 1997 U.S. National Scottish Fiddle Championship, which awarded her the opportunity to study with Alasdair Fraser and introduced her to fiddle camps and the folk community -- both of which continue to play an integral role in her life. Hanneke teaches regularly at Fraser\u2019s Valley of the Moon and Sierra Fiddle Camps, the Mike Block String Camp (run by her husband, acclaimed cellist Mike Block), Harald Haugaard\u2019s International Fiddle School, and the Boston Harbor Scottish Fiddle School.

It\u2019s in how well you understand that the music comes from the land, and that its roots run deep.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings.

With a posse of like-minded individuals, Iration toured the country absorbing various sounds. With Papa Sam, the sound initially performed under the name Ital Rockers Hi-Fi. Notable influences were Jah Shaka and Jah Tubby. Iration acknowledged that he was amazed by Jah Tubby\u2019s collection of original dubplates when he secured his first acetates. A sound system clash in Leeds against Jah Shaka resulted in praise from the legendary soundman, encouraging Iration to continue in the business. In 1993, Iration linked up with Dennis Rootical (under the guise of Kitachi), performing the leftfield dope beat sound. Live appearances by the duo were greeted with enthusiasm, playing festivals and clubs around the UK. They are also acknowledged as being the first to utilize DAT recordings of their own tunes at the High Rise studio in Leeds and to mix them live. With Jack Rouble joining the group, their reputation grew and Iration Steppas released the classic \u2018Scud Missile\u2019 in 1993. The single was met with enthusiasm and demand led to the discomix being re-pressed three times before eventually being deleted. The initial hit was followed by the equally popular 12-inch discomix, \u2018Mystical Warrior\u2019. Acclaimed by the media as Jah Shaka\u2019s \u2018enlightened offspring\u2019, they followed the hit with two 10-inch releases, \u2018Reminiscence Dub\u2019 and \u2018Kilimanjaro\u2019 both of which were featured on their debut album. As Kitachi they released three dope beat singles, \u2018Spirit\u2019, \u2018Scratch Remix\u2019 and \u2018Heavyweight\u2019.

THE DOGS rocked hard, fast and precise (energy-maniacs onstage they may have been, their proficiency as teens cast them practically as rock prodigies) with their own original songs from the get-go. They opened for the likes of MC5, Stooges, Amboy Dukes with Ted Nugent, SRC etc. etc. etc. throughout the late '60s/early '70s. By late 1973 THE DOGS moved to NYC opening for Kiss, The Stilettos (proto-Blondie,) Television and all manner of punks watchful of THE DOGS' pared-down but hardcore Detroit rock performed in their own torn jeans and leather jackets (\"Our normal street clothes because,\" laughs bassist MARY KAY, \"we couldn't afford stage clothes.\") Relocation to Hollywood mid-decade would find them opening for AC/DC, The Ramones, Van Halen, The Motels, Y+T, New Order. 1978 saw THE DOGS move to the UK to live and tour in support of the now legendary \"Slash Your Face\" EP on their own distributed Detroit Records. After great reviews and packed shows the band ended up squatting in vacant houses living on the streets of London because of the bands financial backing pulled out. When the band returned to LA the scene had changed and the band broke up. The rock and roll dreams of not being signed to major label took their toll on the band. From the time they stopped performing as \"The Dogs\", their early singles started to be sold in the underground scenes of Europe and Japan for several hundreds of dollars each due to a base of fans made up of mid 70's to late 70's Detroit type punk fans. Due to this activity, a new generation discovered The Dogs. The classic Detroit sound was vindicated though thousands of rock fans and bands, continuing to this very second. And THE DOGS' reputation via the emerging internet had accelerated their doggy tale into its present, deserved status of bona fide, singular, committed, hardest rock/power trio/punk rock legends. In 2000 Lee Joseph from Dionysus Records released the compilation LP called \"Fed Up\" of the 70's singles and tracks were recorded live in San Francisco for the \"Slash Your Face\" 1978 EP. 2001 saw the band playing shows in the LA area. The \"Suburban Nightmare\u201d LP on Dionysus came out in 2003. In the Far East of the globe, an aggregate of 29 assorted Japanese alt-punk bands styled an entire tribute cd to THE DOGS entitled \"Doggy Style,\" by Detroit Jack's Future Now Records. Then came THE DOGS' tour of Japan in 2007 to capacity-filled venues of rabid Dogs' fans. 2009 saw the band play the SXSW Festival in Austin & the NXNE festival in Toronto. In 2013 they were asked back to play the SXSW Festival and a return trip to Tokyo for 5 shows. In Jan 2016 the band\u2019s newest release will be a new 4 song 7\u201d vinyl release of titled \u201cAin\u2019t Going Nowhere on Elvis Cortez\u2019s label Smelvis Records.

Authenticity is A difficult thing to measure in American roots music. It\u2019s not in the hat you wear, or the twang in your voice. It\u2019s in how well you understand that the music comes from the land, and that its roots run deep. Americana songwriter Amber cross understands this, and on her new album, Savage on the Downhill, she makes music as beholden to the landscapes of Northern and Pacific California, where she lives and travels, as to the visually-rich songwriting she crafts around it. Her songs hang heavy with the yellow dust of dirt roads, plunge deep into the soft loam of the forest. As a woman of the backcountry, she knows the countryside well, and has a deep respect for the honest work that makes you a steward of the land. Upon first hearing Amber Cross you might think you are listening to an archival Smithsonian recording. Her old-time voice is clear and captivating, like a strong muscle, fringed in lace. She's a singer and songwriter who writes from her own life\u2019s struggles and experiences, delivering her stories with unforgettable power and emotion. She is joined by her husband James Moore on guitar and mandolin. Moore\u2019s skillful picking adds rich texture to the fabric the music and his vocal harmonies support for the depth of the songs themselves. James tour with Amber extensively.

With a posse of like-minded individuals, Iration toured the country absorbing various sounds. With Papa Sam, the sound initially performed under the name Ital Rockers Hi-Fi. Notable influences were Jah Shaka and Jah Tubby. Iration acknowledged that he was amazed by Jah Tubby\u2019s collection of original dubplates when he secured his first acetates. A sound system clash in Leeds against Jah Shaka resulted in praise from the legendary soundman, encouraging Iration to continue in the business. In 1993, Iration linked up with Dennis Rootical (under the guise of Kitachi), performing the leftfield dope beat sound. Live appearances by the duo were greeted with enthusiasm, playing festivals and clubs around the UK. They are also acknowledged as being the first to utilize DAT recordings of their own tunes at the High Rise studio in Leeds and to mix them live. With Jack Rouble joining the group, their reputation grew and Iration Steppas released the classic \u2018Scud Missile\u2019 in 1993. The single was met with enthusiasm and demand led to the discomix being re-pressed three times before eventually being deleted. The initial hit was followed by the equally popular 12-inch discomix, \u2018Mystical Warrior\u2019. Acclaimed by the media as Jah Shaka\u2019s \u2018enlightened offspring\u2019, they followed the hit with two 10-inch releases, \u2018Reminiscence Dub\u2019 and \u2018Kilimanjaro\u2019 both of which were featured on their debut album. As Kitachi they released three dope beat singles, \u2018Spirit\u2019, \u2018Scratch Remix\u2019 and \u2018Heavyweight\u2019. The new wave of dub followers can also discover many specials recorded for a variety of 90s-style dub compilations, including Macro Dub Infection, Dubhead Volumes One and Two, Club Meets Dub and Dope On Plastic.\nCLICKABLE LINKS\nWEB - irationsteppas.net\nFB - facebook.com/vanguardofdub\nIG - instagram.com/irationsteppas\nTwitter - twitter.com/irationsteppas\nYouTube - youtube.com/channel/UC5pRWppGHfNu8lvdmIGJKQA\nSpotify - open.spotify.com/artist/0wDFiWgPfBeW7x5kVPBYTW\nINNER STANDING SOUND W/JUNIOR DREAD & RAS AMLAK\nInner Standing Sound plays well tuned & heavily amplified Reggae and Dub to uplift the body, mind, and soul.

Despite its harsh climate, it was Suave\u2019s love for his city and its unique musical heritage that made survival in the N.O. possible. Suave has often tells his fans, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for music, I would have been gone. Music saved my life.\u201d It is that reverence for music that influences Suave to craft real art with his unique talent. Shunning gimmicks, mimicry, and over-production, his music comes directly from the heart of a man who has beaten improbable odds and challenges his audience to do so as well. \"Suave's voice just makes you want to listen, because it doesn't sound like anything or anybody else on the radio.\" - Lyfe Jennings Artist | Activist | Advocate | CitizenFive | MJ's Brass Boopers | Them People Productions | GPNYC Records | BFAM Music Group", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "The Egyptian Lover", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Sat Nov 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-02", "Genre": "Genres: Electronic, Electro House", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "9PM ~ Egyptian Lover, DJ Mophono, Jaysonik, Mega_Lo, Neto ~ $20 ~ 21+"}, {"Address": "1233 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Panic is Perfect", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7206228.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.396415, 37.764922], "Date": "Sat Nov 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-02", "Genre": "Genres: u tell us", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Bottom Of the Hill", "moreBioInfo": "PANIC IS PERFECT\n\n\n\nSan Francisco based band, Panic Is Perfect, came to be in a very roundabout way. Founders Jeremy Belzer and Mike Hoffman actually formed the project in Southern India by way of travel throughout their relative lives from Kansas City, Portland, Los Angeles, Ghana, Thailand, Korea, China, India eventually settling in the Bay Area and completing the 5-piece live band with the addition of Ty Parker on drums, Joey Hassid on synths and David Monzon on guitar.\n\n\n\nJeremy chased the arts and was awarded a scholarship to CalArts taking 1st place in a nationwide painting competition. He spent nights listening to records in the library and wound up majoring in Music Composition. After college, he decided to take to the world with his laptop, guitar and microphone and wrote and recorded hundreds of songs while living in the jungles of Thailand, seeking higher consciousness in India, and sweating in tiny apartments in Korea and China.\n\n\n\nMike, a drummer since the age of 10, dropped out after his first year of music school to travel to West Africa and study with a Master tribal drummer in rural Ghana. Mike played heavily in the local African and Afro-pop scene upon returning home, later moving to LA to finish his education at CalArts. It was there that he was turned on to writing and producing music, making his first solo album on an 8-track tape recorder.\n\n\n\nMusic became the driver and underneath their syncopated, multi-layered rhythmic arrangements, Panic Is Perfect writes simple indie pop songs with meaningful lyrics and melodies that stay with you long after the songs end. Sharing vocals, Mike and Jeremy sway the listener in and out of catchy vocal and melodic hooks, danceable beats and textures that reflect their well-travelled global tastes and influences. As multi-instrumentalists, they both play most of the instruments on their recordings. They each sing lead vocals on the songs that they contribute as writers, adding more diversity to the overall sound. Ultimately Panic is Perfect writes songs that, when stripped of all their elaborate production, are meaningful, memorable and undeniably unique and infectious.", "otherInfo": "In partnership with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, we\u2019re pleased to announce a special benefit show featuring the percussive pop of Panic Is Perfect, the indie folk vibes of the LA-based Minnesota Child, and the livetronica dance tracks of Great Highway.\n\nEach musician will be donating 100% of their portion of ticket sales to raise money for cancer awareness, research, and funding for patients.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "21+"}, {"Address": "456 Castro, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Hard", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8689754.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.435431, 37.761602], "Date": "Sat Nov 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-02", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Hdm Hard Dance Music, Hard Rock, All Forms Of Tough Music", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Q Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Denim, sweet riffs, and leg kicks.\n\nDaniel Sowards\nCody Balaschak\nThomas Sweat\nBrady Gomillion", "otherInfo": "\"Hard\" w/ DJ Haute Toddy"}, {"Address": "3140 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "El Grupo Kazzabe", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419282, 37.747238], "Date": "Sat Nov 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-02", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Roccapulco", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "3140 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Grupo Kazzabe", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419282, 37.747238], "Date": "Sat Nov 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-02", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Roccapulco", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Ayla Nereo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8203379.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Sat Nov 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-02", "Genre": "Genres: Folktronica, Folk, Cinematic Alt-folk, Cinematic Folk, Female Vocals, Acappella, World Folk, Fusion", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "Ayla Nereo is a voice for the planet, a beacon of light, a modern bard of beauty singing directly from her soul.

With an uncanny ability to disarm and crack open the heart, Ayla\u2019s lucid storytelling and magical presence rings with love, as she sings for the depth of our humanness, a truth beyond time and place, and the pure wonder of life itself.\n\nCalling us to listen deeper, her songs are elegant masterpieces of lucid storytelling, with lyrics ringing as anthems and mantras for hope, healing, and love.\n\nThough you\u2019d never know it by witnessing her perform, Ayla grew up with a deep fear of singing. In her final year of college, songs began pouring through her, and it was only through the constant urging of those around her that she began to slowly share her music. Propelled by the songs themselves, Ayla\u2019s journey of meeting those fears and singing through them has propelled her into the powerful performer she is today, touching an ever-widening global audience with the inspiring magic of her songs.\n\nA child schooled at home in the hills of Sonoma County, Ayla was raised on Cat Stevens, Bob Dylan, opera, classical music, traditional celtic songs, and ABBA -- influences which have deeply shaped her music. Touching on both the timeless and modern, she always rides the line between genres, so that her songwriting and sound ultimately cannot be compared to anyone else.\n\nDancing her own songs on stage as she sings them, her movement and presence gives the audience a permission to be wild, real, vulnerable, and alive. Every performance Ayla gives is its own inspired journey; an enchanting and poignant experience that holds you by the heart and doesn\u2019t let go.\n\nAyla is releasing her 6th album in the spring of 2019 via Jumpsuit Records. Honing her artistry and craft over the years, Ayla has developed a loyal fanbase, one that has recently seen exponential growth into widening circles across the planet. The upcoming release of her phenomenal new album, \"By The Light of the Dark Moon\", marks a stepping-out into the world arena. With a nationwide tour supporting the album release, a full summer of notable festival appearances, and her second European tour on the horizon, Ayla's music is reverberating from a west-coast transformational niche into larger global audiences, to inspire and uplift the hearts of humanity. Her music has also recently seen rapid and increasing growth throughout Europe, as well as Canada, Australia, and dozens of other countries.\n\nTo date, Ayla has released 5 solo albums, 2 Wildlight albums (the collaboration project of Ayla and David Sugalski, aka The Polish Ambassador), and 3 collaboration albums.\n\n\u201cA poet, musician, visionary and mystic, Ayla Nereo is an otherworldly artist who shares the fruits of her soul.\u201d ~ The Huffington Post\n\n\u201c[Ayla\u2019s] relationship with the earth is imprinted in her music \u2026 thickly layered tracks where expansive and intriguing instrumentals serve as an intricate backdrop for her delicate and soft-spoken vocals.\u201d ~ Billboard\n\n\u201cI am here to receive songs that help us remember our origins, our incredible human potential, and our right relationship with all Life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are born of dust and silence.

He began playing Acid House, Disco and the classic Chicago style of his peers at a young age, developing a unique sound that lead him to performances at Chicago\u2019s legendary underground warehouse parties of the 90s, and a residency at the Power House. These formative experiences solidified his artistry, launching him into a four year residency in Amsterdam and an eight year residency at Chicago\u2019s infamous Boom Boom Room. In 1994 Gene hit the studio with a driving need for innovation and audio exploration. A self-taught engineer and producer, his work with Cajual, Relief Records, Defected Records, Soma Recordings and his own breakout label Farris Wheel Recordings, propelled his influence into ever expanding realms. He has played venues all over the world and massive festival crowds at Coachella, Outside Lands, Firefly, BPM 2015, and is performing at Movement and WMC events this year. Strongly engaged with his city, he performed Chicago\u2019s Wavefront Festival in 2012 and '2013, hosts \u201cGene Farris & Friends\u201d monthly at Primary, and frequents the booth at Spy Bar. Working closely with fellow Chicago house legend Cajmere, AKA Green Velvet, has resulted in over 15 collaborative singles! \u2018O\u2019Darlin\u2019 from their 2014 Jungle Love EP on Cajual hit number one on TraxSource, with Gene producing 3 additional number one hits that year. He went on to sweep the overall 2014 charts: \u2018Move Your Body\u2019, \u201cRules of Engagement\u201d and \u201cCosmos\u201d took #1, #3 and #5 respectively in top 100 Techno Tracks of the year; \u2018The Way To Go\u2019 topped the Jackin chart at #1 for 2014; \u2018O\u2019 Darlin\u2019 took \u2018#2 in Soulful House, and to top it off, the #3 Album of the year went to \u2018Cosmos\u2019 (Relief Records). 2015 is all about turning up the momentum. With Gene\u2019s first dirtybird release currently bumping in the clubs, and tracks dropping on Visonquest, Defected, Cajual and Relief this spring, his insatiable drive, talent and love of his craft clearly keep him on the cutting edge, and sharing his wealth of house music with the world.

After starting the Mirau Musik label with friends in 2005, Marco released his first record \"Around The House.\" He made his commercial recording debut on the Mirau Musik label with his Restless EP in 2006, which he followed up with I Say Mista in 2007.

I think we all want to be a cowboy... if this isn't universal, it should be!\u201d\n\n\n\nCo-written by Grammy-nominated hit songwriters Nicole Gallyon, Ross Copperman and Grammy-winning Shane McAnally, the song carries heavy lyrical weight. Quayle turned to Julian King, alongside executive producer and industry veteran Mark Wright, to produce the first taste of her forthcoming album (release date TBD). The trio have hit their stride in the studio blending baritone guitars with Quayle\u2019s warm and powerful vocals drawing inspiration from the Montana native\u2019s western roots.\n\n\n\nNamed one of Rolling Stone Country's \"Top Artists You Need To Know,\" Quayle is garnering attention from her high-energy live performances across the country while sharing stages with artists like Brett Eldredge, Jon Pardi, Carly Pearce, LoCASH, Billy Currington and more; her magnetic energy and booming personality grabs hold of audiences wherever she goes.\n\n\n\nShe has been highlighted in People, Huffington Post, Glamour, Hollywood Life, Inspirer Magazine, Taste Of Country and Sounds Like Nashville, to name a few. She also serves as music ambassador for Murdoch\u2019s Ranch & Home Supply, an original store from her hometown of Bozeman, MT, and has teamed up with national brands like Kampgrounds Of America (KOA), Winnebago, Wrangler, Polaroid and more throughout multiple campaigns.\n\n\n\nQuayle is just getting started.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "7615 Stage Rd, San Gregorio, CA 94074", "Artist": "The Keller Sisters", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8632760.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.34728, 37.31625], "Date": "Sun Nov 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-03", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Folk Rock, Blues, Roots, Folk -, Singer, Songwriter, story teller", "Time": "11:00 AM", "Venue": "San Gregorio General Store", "moreBioInfo": "Sheryl and Kerry grew up in San Francisco and started singing together at an early age performing in glee clubs, choirs and musical theater.\n\nDaughters of film and theater performer \" Eileen Christy \" the summers were spent on the road learning from the best .

The San Diego-native has earned a dusty mystique over the past few years as the center of the Desert Hearts movement and as a house and techno provocateur with a stage presence that suggests he will ride this wave all the way to the top. If there's one thing Mikey does well, it's get the party started.\n\nLion has brought the mothafuckin' ruckus to the stages of Lightning in a Bottle, the dustiest storms at Burning Man, and The Do LaB at Coachella, earning nods from Claude VonStroke, Jamie Jones, and Green Velvet in the process. In doing so, Lion and his signature top hat have developed a boisterous voice in the House & Techno scene with strong tribal, hip-hop, and psychedelic elements.\n\nBut it all started with Wu-Tang and Daft Punk. Lion first found his way behind the decks as a thirteen year old kid, scratching underground hip-hop records religiously after school. At Coachella as a seventeen year old, he witnessed that legendary Daft Punk performance on the same night he tasted his first dose of psychedelics. The show had such a monumental impact on him, he gave up Hip-Hop and became a House DJ the very next day.\n\nAfter honing his craft with weekly marathon DJ sessions at Sala Razzmatazz in Barcelona, Mikey was introduced to Burner culture at Lightning in a Bottle, 2011. It was at his first Burning Man in 2011 that he found a community calling and merged forces with his brother Porkchop, life long friends Marbs & Deep Jesus, and the inimitable Lee Reynolds to form The Desert Hearts Crew.\n\nIn November 2012, Desert Hearts began as a seedy, 200-person renegade gathering deep in the Mojave Desert. The intrepid crew barely survived a set of extreme weather conditions and unfortunate circumstances, but that first party sparked a fire. The entire point of that first Desert Hearts was to create as much love as humanly possible, and now that same gathering has evolved into the darling of the West Coast house and techno scene. The Bi-annual festival is capped at 3500 attendees in order to create the best possible vibe. Built upon beautiful people getting as weird as possible to deep and trippy house and techno, Desert Hearts has already achieved iconic status in the North American Festival Scene.\n\nDesert Hearts has given rise to a family of thousands and it's safe to call it a bonafide movement of love. And while Desert Hearts Records launched in 2014 as a totally-free record label, pushes the sonic aesthetic of the scene, the crew\u2019s busy international calendar of bookings has the DH message spreading far and wide. At the center of it all is Mikey Lion, the dusty prince of desert hearts, a beacon of weird far and wide, and one of this generation\u2019s most compelling agents of love.", "otherInfo": "Miley Lion"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, USA", "Artist": "Rexx Life Raj", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7107075.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.267163, 37.866351], "Date": "Sun Nov 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-03", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "All Ages // 1pm-4pm // Free with RSVP"}, {"Address": "201 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Moz-Art", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.419994, 37.777441], "Date": "Sun Nov 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-03", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Davies Symphony Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Beethoven250: Chamber Music Series: From Darkness To Light - Beethoven & Mozart Experience each turn of phrase\u2014every sigh, every look, every joy\u2014within the intimate realm of chamber music.

The prolific producer\u2019s original production style landed Art Department at the forefront of a major underground music movement, transcending genre barriers and forever altering the landscape of dance music. Their game-changing contribution to electronic music has been undeniable, garnering accolades such as #1 track of the year at the Beatport Awards in 2011 and iTunes #2 \u201cBest Electronic Album\u201d of 2011. Notable mention in wide-spread press, including The Guardian, Rolling Stone, Billboard, Vogue, I:D, Nylon and Vibe Magazine who ranked art department the #2 DJ/Producers in the world in 2013, second only to Daft Punk, firmly established Art Department as a rarity in the world of electronic music.\n\nSince the project\u2019s inception, Jonny has performed at nearly 150 events annually on a never-ending world tour. Upon beginning to tour the project and first being installed as residents at DC10 in Ibiza in 2010, AD has taken the immersive and unique style of DJ\u2019ing across the globe, performing at trendsetting international festivals like Movement, EDC, Lollapalooza, Coachella andTomorrowWorld to name but a few and has been an ambassador for Ultra's recent Resistance brand the world over.\n\nArt Department\u2019s debut release arrived in 2010 with the \"Vampire Nightlcub/Without You\" EP, a record so unique that it set the electronic music world ablaze placing the project firmly at the foundation of a new era in underground dance music. Since then the prolific producers honed their original and remix production\nskills for top international record labels, most notably on White\u2019s own No.19 Music, with their crown jewel being the impressive debut album \u201cThe Drawing Board\u201d released on the revered Crosstown Rebels label.\n\nArt Department\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cNatural Selection\u201d expanded upon their previous body of work, building a deeper and more experimental sound while staying true their original music style that won the hearts of their dedicated fans. In 2015 Glasgow left the group to pursue a solo project while Art Department entered its next chapter with Jonny taking the helm. White established the change in direction with the creation of the 82nd mix in the legendary Fabriccompilation series - focused more narrowly on the dance floor and a heavier, dubby house and techno sound. One year later in 2016, Art Department embarked on yet another milestone event - mixing the latest edition in the legendary Renaissance Mix Collection. The double disc showcased a deeper side of the artist's taste and original production, featuring his own production \"Bodies\" and a collaboration with Toronto native AD/D \"Motorcity Sunrise\" which saw notable success.\n\nJonny has also continued to successfully develop his beloved No.19 Music record label with long-time friend and co-founder Nitin, which to date has released works from over 150 of the most influential, electronic artists, across the globe. As the label approaches it's 10th year in 2018, No.19 has become one of the most sought after contemporary imprints in dance music today.\n\nWhite has found his latest efforts materialize in the form of two new vinyl-only imprints. The first, being Social Experiment, the name used for the brand of highly successful No.19 Music record label showcases that have been one of the most in-demand events for club and music festival promotors around the world. While the second imprint, named Sunday Money will serves as yet another opportunity to provide even more artists with a platform to release music, catering more to collectors of deeper, \"post-minimal\" house and techno. In 2018 White added yet another label to his portfolio in the form of a partnership in Subwax Bcn, the imprint and distribution company with a catalogue of over 100 vinyl only labels.\n\nIn 2017, Jonny began his work on an issue close to his heart - Music Against Animal Cruelty (MAAC), a non-profit organization with one simple directive: to aid in wildlife conservation through the medium of music, rallying support form the music industry to protect diminishing populations from extinction. In 2018 his conservation initiative reached Ibiza in a collaborative effort with Yann Pissemen and Ushuai that saw the electronic music community come together in support of the largest fundraiser of it's kind to date. As an additional contribution, the Social experiment imprint forms a crucial part of fundraising efforts in its guise as a non-profit record label with all proceeds being designated to MAAC.\n\nNow, as we look forward to 2019, Art Department continues to evolve with Jonny planning to release a series of original releases to coincide with the 10th year of No.19 Music and a string of global showcases to celebrate the occasion. Never one to rest on his laurels, Art Department strives to explore new sounds and ideas, continuing to bring his reimagining of a project loved by so many to the world stage with no end in site.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "230 Petaluma Ave, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "The Trespassers", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.822691, 38.40115], "Date": "Sun Nov 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-03", "Genre": "Genres: Country, Bluegrass", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "HopMonk Tavern Sebastopol", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Buzzy Martin and the Trespassers (Benefit for At Risk Kids)"}, {"Address": "6687 Sonoma Hwy, Santa Rosa, CA 95409", "Artist": "Twang Ditty", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6386423.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.608681, 38.447048], "Date": "Sun Nov 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-03", "Genre": "Genres: Honky Tonk, Traditional Country", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Annadel Estate Winery", "moreBioInfo": "Since it\u2019s beginnings in 2007, Twang Ditty has been on a mission to keep old school country music alive, true and exciting.

The album\u2019s nine songs report back from the rich incubator that is the road, with pieces written from snippets recorded at soundchecks, gigs and jam sessions\u2014field recordings of the jazz trio in its natural habitat. On his first full trio outing, Blades is joined by guitarist Jeff Parker (Tortoise, Joey DeFrancesco, Joshua Redman) and drummer Simon Lott (Charlie Hunter, Will Bernard), both musicians who share Blades\u2019 grounding in tradition and urge to push it forward.\n\n\u201cBoth those guys can play straight-ahead jazz, they can funk, they can take it out, they can go in so many different directions,\u201d Blades says. \u201cI always had the idea in my mind that doing a trio with Jeff Parker and Simon Lott would have a cool vibe and would be very open.\u201d\n\nField Notes takes full advantage of that versatility and openness, exploring the full breadth of the organ trio\u2019s potential. \u201cOn this record, I was definitely trying to come out of the lineage but then trying to look forward at the same time,\u201d Blades says. \u201cMy whole thing is having a foot in the past and trying to have a foot in the future and to bring those two worlds together as much as possible.\u201d\n\nAt the outset of the album, Blades is dubbed \u201cthe magnificent, wonderful, sometimes tragic Wil Blades\u201d by a critic whose opinion is almost as important as Dr. Lonnie\u2019s: Blades\u2019 eight-year-old daughter, whose grandiose introduction of her father was captured while she was \u201chopped up on sugar and saying crazy, hilarious stuff.\u201d That intro showcases Blades\u2019 sense of humor, setting a warm, genial tone that carries throughout the CD\u2019s many moods. Her pronouncement leads directly into the shuffling blues of \u201cMiller\u2019s Time.\u201d The blues is a deep vein that runs through the entire album, straight through to the classic \u201cI Get the Blues When It Rains,\u201d which closes the album on a note of New Orleans soul.\n\nThat influence harkens back to Blades\u2019 roots in Chicago, where he grew up playing drums and guitar in rock and funk bands. He moved west to study jazz at the New College of California, where he studied with bassist Herbie Lewis. \u201cIt was a real old school jazz education,\u201d Blades recalls. \u201cWith Herbie, it was almost a Mr. Miyagi thing, life lessons where I\u2019d be wondering, \u2018Why am I cleaning the music room right now?\u2019 But as I got older I started to appreciate these fundamental, basic lessons that were actually very deep and useful, more so than what scale to play over what chord.\u201d\n\n\n\nBlades had begun adding the organ to his repertoire at the time, and it was Lewis who pressured him to choose one instrument to focus on. He had discovered the instrument through rock records by the likes of Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix, which led him to Jimmy Smith and other jazz innovators. At the same time, Medeski Martin and Wood had emerged with a new, more radical approach to the organ trio, which Blades found equally intriguing. \u201cSomething about the sound of the organ really turned me on,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was just something about it that I really dug, and I can\u2019t really explain it.\u201d\n\nOver the past fifteen years, Blades has grown to be one of the most in-demand organ players on the Bay Area scene. In addition to leading his own trio, he works regularly in duo situations with drummers Billy Martin (Medeski Martin and Wood) and Scott Amendola (Nels Cline Singers); and in trios led by guitarist Will Bernard and drummer Stanton Moore. He\u2019s performed and recorded with a host of jazz and blues greats including Melvin Sparks, Idris Muhammad, Joe Louis Walker, Don Braden, Donald Harrison, Nicholas Payton, Karl Denson, Charlie Hunter, Jason Marsalis, Herlin Riley, and many others.\n\nNot long after Blades\u2019 arrival in California, Dr. Lonnie Smith came to town to play a week of shows at the renowned club Yoshi\u2019s with fellow organ great Jimmy McGriff. \u201cI went to every single set,\u201d Blades says. \u201cThe music was so soulful, it was addictive.\u201d Finally mustering the nerve to approach Dr. Lonnie, Blades found an eager mentor; the two continue to play duo shows to this day.\n\n\u201cA lot of older guys really want the music to be carried on, and the old school method was not jazz college, it was mentorship,\u201d Blades says. \u201cLonnie has really taken me under his wing. It\u2019s always an amazing experience to get to play with him; he really is one of my heroes.\u201d\n\nThose lessons have paid off stunningly well, as evidenced in Blades\u2019 scintillating and soulful playing throughout Field Notes, whether on the soul-into-psychedelia shimmer of \u201cChrome\u201d (developed from an improvisation with Billy Martin) or the blues-meets-electric-Miles groove of \u201cDewey\u201d or the African rhythmic accents of \u201cAddis,\u201d inspired by a 2011 trek to Ethiopia, where Blades got to work with local musicians. Stylistically, the album ranges from the alluring balladry of \u201cForgetful\u201d to the smooth, slinky R&B of \u201cRed Lanterns Are Blue,\u201d which draws inspiration from J Dilla and Patrice Rushen.\n\nWhile he wrote most of the album with his bandmates in mind, often building on fragments from jams and improvs grabbed by his iPhone, Blades pays specific tribute to both of his sidemen on a pair of tracks. \u201c(I Can\u2019t Stand) The Whole Lott of You\u201d was named for an inside joke and is another unwitting contribution from Dr. Lonnie, who intoned the title in a mock English accent upon meeting Simon Lott. The title can be (and occasionally is) sung to the tune\u2019s catchy funk chorus. Blades cedes the spotlight entirely to Jeff Parker on \u201cParks N\u2019 Wreck,\u201d a vibe-based tune driven by the organist\u2019s memorable bassline that was inspired by the guitarist\u2019s work in the hip-hop realm.\n\nAs his endorsement suggests, if Dr. Lonnie Smith and his fellow members of the B-3 pantheon are concerned about their legacy they can rest easy after hearing Field Notes. Wil Blades ably carries on the organ tradition while infusing it with modern influences, suggesting an exciting future for the instrument and for this trio.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Oakland, CA", "Artist": "Melanie Ida Chopko", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8889200.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2714, 37.8045], "Date": "Sun Nov 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-03", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter, Acoustic, Neo-Folk, Folk Jazz", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Bushwick Book Club at East Bay Booksellers", "moreBioInfo": "Melanie Ida Chopko writes and performs \u201cwit, acuity and grace,\" exploring themes of belonging and our relationship both to the natural world and the divine.

Blades\n\n\u201cThe breadth of what we do is so wide we don't have to think about it,\u201d says longtime Bay Area drummer Scott Amendola, when talking about fellow local organist Wil Blades--the other half of the dynamic music duo known as Amendola vs. Blades. \u201cThe cool thing is we can play swingin\u2019 old school jazz, funk and rock, African music, to playing free.\u201d Such dynamic range would prove challenging for any band, let alone one consisting merely of eight limbs, two analog keyboards and a drum kit. But it\u2019s a challenge the two friends have eagerly met gig after gig since their auspicious first show together, a performance of Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite\u201d as an organ and drums arrangement, ten years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s all about keeping it fresh,\u201dadds Amendola. \u201cAnd keeping the audience engaged.\u201d And keeping audiences sonically freshened and engaged throughout their ever-evolving decade-long stint hasn\u2019t been a problem for this uncanny duo, who\u2019ve imprinted plenty of nondescript juke joints: the High Sierra Music Festival, SF Jazz, and the iconic Fillmore, alike with their slithery sound, enough to make stalwart critics like the SF Chronicle\u2019s Joel Selvin squawk: \"As for Wil Blades and Scott Amendola, these two Young Turks of the San Francisco jazz scene are bringing the organ-drum duo into the 21st century.\" And during this century, if you wanted to experience Amendola vs. Blades, you\u2019d have to be one of the many thousands who\u2019ve steadily showed up at one of their live duo adventures. Sure, you may have seen and/or heard these two in-demand session players as bandleaders in their own right, or as distinguished sidemen with the likes of Nels Cline, Charlie Hunter, John Zorn, Mike Patton, John Scofield, Idris Muhammad, Bernard Purdie, or Dr. Lonnie Smith. But if you wanted an album of just the two of them facing off as they do, literally on stage--you\u2019d have to wait. Until now. Finally, Scott Amendola and Wil Blades bring us their long-anticipated debut album\u2014Greatest Hits\u2014on Sazi Records. Recorded over two nights in front of an intimate audience in a downtown Oakland club in June of last year, Greatest Hits is comprised of seven originals, tunes that had initially been composed and recorded by Scott and Wil for other projects. Depending who you ask, the album title could perhaps be construed as a mini-sampler of what\u2019s to come, or perhaps a facetious statement of what was. The germ for the album took shape nearly two years ago. Adds Scott, \u201cWe always talked about it, but our schedules never lined up due to both of us being heavily on the road. As other projects ended, we actually had time to take it seriously.\u201dBlades adds, \u201cThe thing about live recording was double-fold. For us playing as a duo is very loose and fun, so the best way to capture that was live--the vibe of a studio can make you feel restrained under pressure. A loose gig is a better representation of how we play our stuff, which is improvising.\u201dOn Greatest Hits, such improvisation creatively steers the duo through a scenic tour of music genres, as each artist pushes and pull the other toward unanticipated discovery, all the while powered by the heavy grooves laid down by Blades\u2019 mastery of the Hammond organ, and Hohner Clavinet, and anchored by Amendola\u2019s rhythmic drum array. \u201cMost organ players are piano players first,\n\norgan players second. But Wil\u2019s the opposite. His relationship to the organ is deeper than anyone I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d, say Amendola. In addition to Hammond organ, (and requisite Leslie speaker), Blades doubles his keyboard arsenal with the distinct sound of a Clavinet, one he spent a summer tediously restoring. \u201cIt literally has my blood, sweat and tears in it,\u201d laughs Wil. \u201cIt opens up more sonic possibilities, and just adds another color texture to the mix.\u201dThe seven tunes on Greatest Hits impresses with its own set of colors and textures.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. He\u2019s never more than one degree away from a powerful musical hook-up.", "otherInfo": "Scott Amendola-drums/electronics/percussion, Wil Blades-Hammond B3/ Clavinet.

Nothing you read and nothing you hear from her album prepares you for how good a performer she is. From her albums you can tell that she is a gifted songwriter with a beautiful voice. From other people's comments about her you can learn that she is a natural story teller with a fantastic sense of humor. But until you see her in person, you never really believe what you've been told about her. Besides, almost half of the songs she does during her shows haven't been recorded! If you have never seen her do a live concert, then by all means do so! I get e-mail from people all the time thanking me for spreading the word about Cheryl. They go to the concert knowing they will enjoy it, and often find it even better than they had thought it would be. If she doesn't ever perform near you, then buy her video and see what you are missing. Then make arrangements to be where she is performing soon. Her Career: Cheryl's first concert was to a captive audience. She found an old toy ukelele in a neighbor's attic and serenaded her mother who was taking a bath at the time. A year later she got a real ukelele, then finally got her first guitar. She learned guitar from a neighbor, who also taught a group of boys. Each week they would get together and play just about any song they could think of for hours on end. Her first public performance was at a Hootenany type show when she was 12. She started writing songs when she was 17. She has never had a \"Day Job\". Her first professional gigs were at the Steak and Ale Restaurant in her home town of Timonium, Maryland. The place only had one PA system; in the middle of her songs you would hear: \"Jones, party of four ... Jones, party of four\". She finally convinced them to get a second PA system. She performed at venues around Baltimore and Washington DC before moving to New England in 1976, where she now lives. She had a band for a while, but usually performs solo now, or with Kenny White, who often opens and then accompanies her and sings backup. She often appears in the On a Winter's Night tour, and was part of the Philo 25th Anniversary tour. Her Albums: In 1983, Cheryl released a self produced EP called Newport Songs. Her first two albums Cheryl Wheeler in 1986, and Half a Book in 1991 were on an independent label, North Star. That company also released a promo tape called Live and Otherwise in 1987. This was a bonus tape that was sent to anyone who filled out a survey form that was included in a number of the North Star albums. Her third album, Circles & Arrows, was originally released on Capitol in 1991, but it was dropped almost immediately due to a political shakeup with the label company. (The people who had promoted her album were let go, and Capitol decided to heavily promote Garth Brooks) Her fourth album Driving Home was on Philo in 1993, a division of Rounder, and produced three singles: Almost, Silver Lining, and 75 Septembers, a song written for her father, and covered by Peter, Paul & Mary on their album Life Lines. Rounder later reissued Circles & Arrows in 1995, followed by Mrs. Pinocci's Guitar in 1995, Sylvia Hotel in 1999, the compilation album Different Stripe, and finally Defying Gravity. In 2003, Cheryl graciously allowed the creation of No Previous Record, a two-disc album of songs that were never released on a commercial label. This album consisted of audience, FM, and soundboard recordings, and is restricted to members of her email list. In 1998 a video of a live concert was released, What Do I Care? I Don't Have Any Kids Construction Company. The film had been shot a few years before, so that by the time it came out, Cheryl's act had changed enough that people who saw the video would still see a different show when they went to see Cheryl perform. Her Songs: Cheryl's songs are often emotional portraits of people, leaving you with the impression that you know the characters. You find yourself being dragged into the song rather than standing outside and observing. Other songs by Cheryl are hilarious situation comedies. From her songs you can get glimpses about her childhood: She was a Tom-Boy ( I Know This Town ) who loved music ( Music In My Room ). You can also get glimpses of her adulthood: Her move to New England ( Northern Girl ), her neighbors ( Quarter Moon and His Home Town ), her surroundings ( When Fall Comes to New England, and The Storm ), and her time on the road ( Rainy Road Into Atlanta, Lighting Up the Mighty Mississippi, and Sylvia Hotel ). But the songs that touch people the most are her songs about relationships, such as Arrow, Aces, and But the Days and Nights Are Long (formerly \"Boulder Hotel Room\"). Cheryl's funny songs are legendary. Unfortunately, they are almost never recorded. One notable exception is Estate Sale for which a video was made. Cheryl has always said that doing a funny song live is quite different than recording one. I guess enough of us have complained, because Mrs. Pinocci's Guitar and Sylvia Hotel have several of my favorite funny ones. Good songs to request at concerts are: Cow Pattern Clothes (which is on her video, (I Can't Watch) TV, and, of course, Is It Peace Or Is It Prozac?. Her Concerts: If your idea of a folk singer/songwriter concert is a bunch of people clapping politely after songs, and then sitting quietly while the performer says things like \"This next song is about ...\", well, you've never seen a Cheryl Wheeler concert before. Cheryl's concerts are more like what you would find at a comedy club than expect to find at a folk music concert. She will tell a story that has you rolling in the aisles, and then sing a song that leaves you wiping tears from your eyes. She will talk about some serious current event, and then sing a song that will have you howling with laughter. Her entire concert is a emotional roller coaster. Her set list used to be a crumpled piece of paper with a bunch of song titles. She has improved on that. Now she has a picture of her border collie James in a plastic holder with the set list written on a piece of paper tucked behind the picture. After each song, she'll look at the list and decide what to do next. If somebody calls out a request, and her guitar is in the right key, she might try it, even if she hasn't done it in a while. If she has two sets back to back, she almost never does the same (or even similar) group of songs. Her funny stories between songs show as much diversity. Each time she tells a story, it will be a little bit different, so even if you've heard it before, you still find yourself laughing. To repeat, there is no way you can read about Cheryl and get a good picture of what she or her concerts are like. You have to see one.

This summer, they'll headline their hometown's most famous venue, the Ryman Auditorium, just a few blocks from where Johnston and Ray sat in high-school math class daydreaming about one day playing the legendary hall. Johnston's connection to the Ryman goes back even further: his father has been a drummer at the Grand Ole Opry since Jaren was a child. And now he has a son of his own, who, like his old man, will be well-versed in all the sounds that make up both Music City and The Cadillac Three, from country and blues to rock & roll.\n\nSo, yeah, \"legacy\" looks good on this band.\n\n\"We're trying to build something and do it our way, which is always harder,\" says Johnston. \"If you're going to leave something that people are actually going to remember, you can't take the easy way. So we took all of our history, mixed it with the energy of The Cadillac Three and put it into a record that makes sense of where we've been and where we're going.\"\n\nAfter nearly a full year on the road in support of 2016's BURY ME IN MY BOOTS, their first full-length album recorded for Big Machine Records, the group returns with a more mature perspective. Johnston, Mason and Ray have experienced a lot on tour, whether opening arenas across the country on Florida Georgia Line's Dig Your Roots Tour or headlining their own consistently sold-out string of sweaty club and theater shows in the U.K. and Europe. As they prepare to head back in November for another big run, for The Cadillac Three, the old saying really is true: this band is huge overseas.\n\n\"Europe showed us that we should bet on ourselves. It was a big gamble the first time we went over there,\" says Mason, \"but the shows and the fans have continued to grow.\"\n\n\"And going overseas reinforced that we wanted to get more music out more quickly,\" adds Ray. \"They go through singles really quickly over there. They want more, more, more and that encouraged us to go into the studio, knock this album out and keep going.\"\n\nAll that travel, from city to state, country to continent, could decimate a lesser band, but it only served to creatively inspire the mighty TC3. They wrote many of the 11 songs that make up LEGACY on the road, cut the tracks on rare days off in Nashville and then recorded all of Johnston's vocals \u2013 one of the most \"country\" voices in the genre \u2013 in the back lounge of their bus in between shows, adding a crackling sense of vitality to LEGACY. They also produced the album themselves.\n\n\"We knew what we wanted to do with this record. Instead of putting it together in bits and pieces, we started with a batch of songs and then picked a single,\" Johnston says. \"That's how this shit should be done.\"\n\nThat back-to-basics approach to making music yielded the band's most infectious single to date: the woozy sing-along \"Dang If We Didn't.\" Written, as is most of the album, by Johnston and Mason (here, with Jonathan Singleton; other times with songwriters like Laura Veltz and Angelo Petraglia), \"Dang If We Didn't\" teases fans with its ambiguous title, before revealing what the guys actually did in the chorus: get drunk last night.\n\n\"When you're a songwriter, you can be critical of song titles,\" says Johnston. \"But with 'Dang If We Didn't,' I thought it was a little bit mysterious. It makes you wonder, 'Dang if we didn't do what?'\"\n\n\"Eat pizza last night,\" quips Mason. \"It could be anything.\"\n\n\"American Slang\" rivals \"Dang If We Didn't\" in its grandeur. It's a huge song, akin to Tom Petty's \"Free Fallin'\" or The Cadillac Three's own \"Graffiti,\" off BURY ME IN MY BOOTS. Lori McKenna (Little Big Town's \"Girl Crush\") began writing the tune with the intention of having The Cadillac Three finish it. \"We are vampires on Hollywood Boulevard / angels and sinners of our hometown streets,\" go the lyrics, painting a picture of life's rebels, before a massive country-radio chorus kicks in: \"We are the back roads, dirty water shore banks\u2026we are born and raised on American slang.\"\n\nThe constant throughout LEGACY, however, lies in the players: as on all three of The Cadillac Three's albums, only Johnston, Mason and Ray are the musicians. There's no guest keyboard player, no second percussionist and certainly no bassist. Ray holds down the low end on his lap steel.\n\nEspecially on the standout LEGACY track \"Take Me to the Bottom,\" which features Johnston reaching high for a breathtaking falsetto. \"'Take Me to the Bottom' has the best bass sound of anything I've ever done,\" says Ray, who also keeps things greasy on the intense \"Tennessee.\" A thrashing love song, it evokes the stomp of ZZ Top \u2013 a favorite of TC3 \u2013 and features a lyrical shout-out to progressive country hero Sturgill Simpson, a kindred spirit of the band.\n\nNo matter the influence, though, the trio stays faithful to their own unique sound throughout LEGACY. \"Hank & Jesus\" glides along with Tennessee twang; \"Demolition Man\" is distinguished by the space between the notes; and the swaggering \"Cadillacin'\" is a band anthem. \"We don't put anything on our albums that we can't re-create live,\" says Mason. \"If there is a TC3 rule, it's that: keep it honest.\"\n\nHonesty, or authenticity, is a favorite buzzword around Nashville. But few artists come to it as naturally as The Cadillac Three. These guys couldn't fake it if they tried. In the album's title track, they offer a heart-on-the-sleeve testimony to what's really important at the end of one's days: love and a family tree.\n\nWhen Mason and Ray heard \"Legacy,\" co-written by Johnston, they flipped, and pushed for it to be the title of the record. \"We're far enough along in our careers where doing an album called LEGACY doesn't feel presumptuous to me,\" says Mason.\n\nNot when you run through The Cadillac Three's milestones. It's all there, from boundary-pushing albums, Grammy-nominated No. 1 songwriting across genres and fan-favorite singles to sold-out club shows and massive festival gigs alongside Aerosmith.\n\n\"With this album, we're continuing to build this thing we've created. We're touring nonstop, headlining shows in the U.K., playing the Ryman, and putting out a new record,\" says Johnston. \"Shit, that's a pretty good legacy so far.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1805 Geary Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Sam Johnson", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9124994.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Sun Nov 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-03", "Genre": "Genres: The California Sound, Pop, Rock, Reggae", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore", "moreBioInfo": "Sam Johnson\u2019s love for music goes back to his adolescent years, when he learned Bob Marley and Sublime songs on hand me down instruments, and started a reggae band at his high school in Huntington Beach, California. This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\n\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\n\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\n\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers.

As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Nels Cline, Jeff Parker, Charlie Hunter, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinists Jenny Scheinman and Regina Carter, saxophonists Larry Ochs and Phillip Greenlief, and clarinetist Ben Goldberg, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\nWhile rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area scene, Amendola has woven a dense and far-reaching web of bandstand relationships that tie him to influential artists in jazz, blues, rock and new music. A potent creative catalyst, the Berkeley-based drummer is the nexus for a disparate community of musicians stretching from Los Angeles and Seattle to Chicago and New York. Whatever the context, Amendola possesses a gift for twisting musical genres in unexpected directions.\n\nNels Cline maintains his long-running role in the alt-rock juggernaut Wilco, but the band\u2019s long stretches of inactivity mean that he can also perform as a member of the Scott Amendola Band and a recently launched duo project (a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate setting in which Scott thrives). Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings.

The now-famous name came from a magazine article about Australian hunters in the outback who curled up with their dogs for warmth on cold nights; the coldest being \u201cthree dog nights\u201d. Boasting chart and sales records that are virtually unmatched in popular music, THREE DOG NIGHT had 21 consecutive Top 40 hits, including 3 #1 singles, 11 Top 10\u2019s, 18 straight Top 20\u2019s, 7 million-selling singles and 12 straight RIAA Certified Gold LPs. Their hits appeared on best selling charts in all genres (pop, rock and country). Their records continue to sell around the world, reaching beyond the borders of the U.S. into Japan, Canada, Holland, England, Germany, Spain and elsewhere. Tens of millions of THREE DOG NIGHT records have been sold through the years. THREE DOG NIGHT recorded the music of the best (and mostly undiscovered) new songwriters of their time including Harry Nilsson, Randy Newman, Elton John, Laura Nyro, Paul Williams and Hoyt Axton among many others. The group\u2019s eclectic taste, combined with their ability to recognize and record hits in a unique, distinctive and appealing style, resulted in THREE DOG NIGHT dominating the charts for years. The band toured extensively in the late \u201960\u2019s and into the 70\u2019s, but in 1975, the non-stop concerts and hit-making took its toll. According to Cory Wells, \"we just quietly backed out of the picture\". Their desire to \"get away\" from the hectic world of pop music was relatively short-lived however, and by 1981 they discovered that they wanted to perform again. \"The old magic was still there\", noted Danny. Audiences agree. Now, as they mark more than 40 years on the road, THREE DOG NIGHT continue to grow their fan base and develop new ways of doing business. In 2012 they are pursuing an extensive schedule of concerts at theatres, performing arts centers, fairs, festivals, corporate events, and casinos. Since 1986, they have performed over 2,200 shows including two Super Bowls.

It\u2019s chewy too.\nThe addicts call it BAD JUICE and their warning is clear:\nDO NOT CONSUME. IT WILL MAKE YOU SICK\n\nHow did it come to this? In 2017, High Pulp emerged from a weekly \u201cFunk Church\u201d residency at Seattle\u2019s historic jazz club The Royal Room. It was here that the collective took shape, grew together, and set about creating their unique style of instrumental music.\n\nSoon thereafter, High Pulp entered the studio to record their debut album Bad Juice, released in June 2018. Featuring 8 tracks, this album whisks the listener on a Bad-Juice-induced stupor of euphoria and narcosis, all the while inducing subconscious head-bobbing.\n\nNow, High Pulp is feverishly producing their next wave of releases. Their Light Fix EP (Fall 2019) brought vocalists into High Pulp\u2019s extended musical family for the first time, featuring guest appearances by three R&B/soul singers and KEXP favorites: JusMoni, Falon Sierra and Shaina Shepherd (BEARAXE). Meanwhile, High Pulp\u2019s followup instrumental full-length album, titled Moon Milk, lands in 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine throwing on this LP and feeling anything less than joy.

An expert on a daunting menagerie of wind instruments including various clarinets and saxophones, the Burlingame-raised multi-instrumentalist earned international attention with 2011\u2019s These Are the Words and 2013\u2019s Hebrew liturgy-inspired suite For We Have Heard, albums featuring an all-star quartet with pianist Myra Melford, drummer Matt Wilson and trumpeter Darren Johnston.\n\nHe\u2019s recorded a lapidary duo project with pianist Fred Hersch, 2015\u2019s Gravitations Vol. II, and delved into the post-bop canon on his Jackie McLean project Jacknife with Larry Willis, the pianist from the classic 1965 Blue Note album. Recently, he\u2019s been focusing on SLUGish Ensemble, a sextet featuring a brilliant cadre of young musicians centering on the Stanford Jazz Workshop, where Lugerner has worked as the faculty and camp director since 2013.\n\nA vehicle for his low end work on bass clarinet and baritone saxophone, SLUGish grew out of Lugerner\u2019s years in New York City soaking up the striking orchestrational concepts of various large ensembles, particularly Maria Schneider, John Hollenbeck, and Nico\n\nMuhley. Carving out territory adjacent to jazz, the band\u2019s lustrous, multilayered 2018 Slow & Steady Records release An Eight Out of Nine seamlessly weaves improvised passages into extended musical forms.\n\n\u201cEvery once in a while musical magic occurs when a bandleader steps up as a producer.

Their electrifying live shows are more than just a performance, they are an unrivaled jubilated experience. Backline\u2019d with a band equipped with old style instruments & props (a saloon piano, full brass horns, accordion and banjo), tappers, & jump n\u2019 jiving lindy hoppers, PARLOR SOCIAL pays detailed homage to the Harlem Renaissance. But the undercurrent of their urban & hip-hop beats reveals their sound is a uniquely new creation they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cneo-ragtime.\u201d\n\nPARLOR SOCIAL is fronted by Montreal-bred husband and wife team Dessy Di Lauro and Ric\u2019key Pageot. Dessy provides sultry vocals that flawlessly encapsulate the spirit of Uptown\u2019s early 20th Century cultural boom through the prohibition era, but she offers a timeless approach that\u2019s all her own. Serving as musical director and pianist/ accordionist, Ric\u2019key is either playing the squeezebox or tickling the ivories with an affable buoyant stride that promotes the infectiously festive atmosphere of their concerts.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder Dessy and Ric\u2019key are the embodiment of the aforementioned jazz icons they idolized\u2014Dessy grew up admiring and studying musical icons from Ella Fitzgerald to Stevie Wonder. After her mother placed her in the church choir at the ripe age of 4, Dessy\u2019s perennial rendezvous with music began. Singing and performing, or what she calls her \u201cgift from God,\u201d set her on a road to lyrical destiny\u2014a road that led her to background session singing with Patti Labelle, Deborah Cox, and The Neville Bros, and a coveted leading part on Cirque du Soleil\u2019s La Nouba show out of Orlando, Florida.\n\nRic\u2019key was raised in a musical family. His mother and his father, who was an accomplished touring bass player, enrolled Ric\u2019key in classical piano lessons at the age of 8. He later parlayed his skills into garnering several opportunities and milestones, including becoming the youngest musical director ever hired by Cirque Du Soleil when he joined the creation team to work on their groundbreaking arena touring production, Delirium. The large band consisted of an impressive line-up of eleven musicians and six lead singers, among them, Dessy.\n\nDessy and Ric\u2019key\u2019s musical paths eventually lead them to each other. What initially started as a professional relationship (Ric\u2019key produced Dessy\u2019s debut solo EP, A Study of a Woman\u2019s Soul), ended in a flourishing marriage. Dessy and Ric\u2019key began a new life together and set their sites on Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2010, produced and backed by her husband Ric\u2019key, Dessy released her first solo music video \u201cWhy U Raggin\u2019, which won two Hollywood Music in Media Awards, including Best R&B/Soul Song of the Year. Her sophomore effort, 2013\u2019s This is Neo-Ragtime, set them on an even bigger path of stardom when the album\u2019s first single \u201cJump n\u2019 Jivin\u2019\u201d was featured on ESPN throughout the 2013 NCAA basketball Final Four Championship. 2015 brought us her latest EP Say Hep Hep, now nominated for an Independent Music Award (IAM) for \u2018Best Urban EP\u2019, which boasts the aptly titled single and music video \u201cLet Me Hear You Say Hep Hep.\u201d Their latest single, \u201cIt\u2019s Complicated (Let Go)\u2019\u2019 is also nominated for an IAM for Best R&B/Soul song of the year.\n\nDessy and Ric\u2019key realized their harmonious journey has been more than a love affair. The duo combined their shared experiences along with their knowledge & respect for the artists who paved the roads before them and conceived of Parlor Social. Recently, they\u2019ve performed their show at the Blue Note Jazz festival, CMJ Festival in NYC, London, Atlanta, Vancouver, Whistler, Montreal International Jazz festival, London and The BRIC JazzFest in Brooklyn, opening for Kamasi Washington.\n\nIn September 2016, well \u2013respected music critic Patrick O\u2019hefferman raves PARLOR SOCIAL has \u201cundeniably the best live performance in the Los Angeles club scene, if not the nation\u201d.\n\nWhen Dessy and Ric\u2019key aren\u2019t wowing audiences as PARLOR SOCIAL, they\u2019re contributing their artistry throughout the industry. Ric\u2019key has toured with world-renowned, multi-platinum icon Madonna for her \u2018Sticky & Sweet,\u2019 \u2018MDNA\u2019 and \u2018Rebel Heart\u2019 tours, along with Motown Legend Diana Ross\u2019 \u2018More Today Than Yesterday\u2019 tour. He\u2019s also recently written & recorded for R&B songstress Jill Scott and funk legends Earth, Wind and Fire. Dessy has showcased her eclectic songwriting talents in several seminal jazz haunts, including with platinum-selling saxophonist Eric Darius\u2019s 2014 opus, \u2018\u2019Retro Forward\u2019\u2019 produced by Kenny \u2018\u2019Babyface\u2019\u2019 Edmonds\u2019s right hand man, Antonio Dixon.\n\nPARLOR SOCIAL is back in studio working on their upcoming album set for a release in early 2017. The album will include their new song \u2018\u2019Higher Place\u2019\u2019 which features an 11-piece big band arrangement written and directed by Dr. Benjamin Wright whom has collaborated with superstars such as Micheal Jackson, Janet Jackson, Outkast, Justin Timberlake, etc. Their new album will also feature the New Jack Swing king himself, Teddy Riley on vocoder. Riley has produced and written for Micheal Jackson as well, Lady Gaga, NSync, Bobby Brown, and Whitney Houston, but he is mostly known for writing, performing, and producing the 1996 Blackstreet smash-hit, No Diggity. For the song\u2019s 20th anniversary on September 30th, PARLOR SOCIAL posted a youtube video of them interviewing Riley discussing his music and legacy to help commemorate the milestone anniversary.\n\nPARLOR SOCIAL posted on their Facebook page a recent live performance their neo-ragtime rendition of the hit \u2018No Diggity\u2019 with Teddy Riley himself as a special guest.

All sales are final.\nMarika Hackman\n\u201chand solo,\u201d \u201cblow,\u201d \u201cconventional ride\u201d\u2014these are just a few of the cheeky offerings off Any Human Friend, the new album from rock provocateur Marika Hackman. \u201cThis whole record is me diving into myself and peeling back the skin further and further, exposing myself in quite a big way. It can be quite sexual,\u201d Hackman says. \u201cIt\u2019s blunt, but not offensive. It\u2019s mischievous.\u201d There\u2019s also depth to her carnal knowledge: Any Human Friend (out via AMF Records and Sub Pop Records in North and South America) is ultimately about how, as she puts it, \u201cWe all have this lightness and darkness in us.\u201d\nHackman lifted the album\u2019s title from a documentary about four-year-olds interacting with dementia patients in senior homes. At one point, two little girls confer about their experience there, with one musing on how it\u2019s great to make \u201cany human friend,\u201d whether old or young. \u201cWhen she said that it really touched a nerve in me,\u201d says the London-based musician. \u201cIt\u2019s that childlike view where we really accept people, are comfortable with their differences.\u201d\nSuch introspection has earned Hackman her name. Her 2015 debut, We Slept at Last, was heralded for being nuanced and atmospheric. She really found her footing with her last release, I\u2019m Not Your Man\u2014which earned raves from The Guardian, Stereogum, and Pitchfork\u2014and its sybaritic, swaggering hit \u201cBoyfriend,\u201d which boasts of seducing away a straight guy\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cHer tactile lyrics keep the songs melodically strong and full of surprises,\u201d remarked Pitchfork. We\u2019ll say!\n\u201cI\u2019m a hopeless romantic,\u201d she explains. \u201cI search for love and sexual experience, but also I\u2019m terrified by it.\u201d Hackman is a Rid of Me-era PJ Harvey for the inclusive generation: unbounded by musical genre, a preternatural lyricist and tunesmith who isn\u2019t afraid to go there. (Even her cover art, which finds Hackman nearly nude while cradling a baby pig, is a nod to Dutch photographer Rineke Dijkstra\u2019s unfiltered photos of mothers just after they gave birth.) To that end, \u201chand solo\u201d extorts the virtues of masturbation and features Hackman\u2019s favorite line, \u201cUnder patriarchal law, I\u2019m going to die a virgin.\u201d The song \u201cblow\u201d paints a picture of social excess. And \u201cconventional ride\u201d thumbs its nose at heterosexual sex through \u201cthe trope a lot of gay women experience: sleeping with someone, then it becomes apparent you\u2019re kind of an experiment.\u201d\nWith Any Human Friend, boundaries are no longer an issue for her. \u201cI sent \u2018all night\u2019 to my parents and they were quite shocked,\u201d she says of the paean to the flesh, dressed as a sweetly harmonic track. \u201cWhy does it sound shocking coming out of my mouth? Women have sex with each other, and it seems to me we aren\u2019t as freely allowed to discuss that as men are. But at no point am I disrespecting the women I\u2019m having sex with. It can be fucking sexy without banging people over the head with a frying pan. It\u2019s sexy sex.\u201d\nSharing intimacies with her parents makes sense when you consider she wrote \u2018the one\u2019\u2014a portrait of the artist amid identity crisis where she crashed after a painful break-up with a longtime girlfriend. \u201c\u2018send my love\u2019 is a proper breakup song,\u201d she says of the levitating, string-laden track. \u201cI actually wrote that in a moment of grief. It\u2019s a strange take on it because I\u2019m imagining myself as my ex-girlfriend.\u201d She penned its companion track, \u201ci\u2019m not where you are,\u201d a melodic earworm about emotional detachment from relationships, roughly six months later.\n\u201cI think because my life was flipped upside down, it was taking me longer to write,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was definitely the hardest process I\u2019ve gone through to make a record.\u201d She wrote the album over a year, recording a few songs at a time with co-producer David Wrench (Frank Ocean, The xx). \u201cI stopped being able to sleep properly,\u201d she says. \u201cI was waking up in the middle of the night to write songs.\u201d\nBut the longer recording process also meant that Hackman had the time to experiment in the studio, especially with electronic songs. She was inspired by Wrench\u2019s vast synth collection, many of which she used throughout Any Human Friend (\u201cthe synths give the album a nice shine\u201d), notably on \u201chold on,\u201d a deep dive into ennui expressed as ethereal R&B. She also switched up drum rhythms and wrote songs on the bass, such as the upbeat, idiosyncratic \u201ccome undone\u201d (working name: \u201cFunky Little Thang\u201d).\nHackman bookends Any Human Friend with some of her most unexpected musical turns. The first song she wrote, \u201cthe one\u201d (technically its second track), is \u201cprobably the poppiest song I\u2019ve ever written,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about that weird feeling of starting the process again from scratch.\u201d To that end, it features a riot grrrl Greek chorus hurling such insults at her as, \u201cYou\u2019re such an attention whore!\u201d The title track closes out the album and explores how, \u201cwhen we\u2019re interacting with people, it\u2019s like holding a mirror up to yourself.\u201d It\u2019s a weightless coda that\u2019s jazz-like in its layering of rhythmic sounds as if you\u2019re leisurely sorting through Hackman\u2019s headspace.\n\u201cThe drive to do all this is all just about trying to work out what the fuck is in my brain,\u201d she says, laughing. The dragon she\u2019s chasing is a rarified peace that materializes after properly tortured herself. \u201cI really did have a good time working on this album,\u201d she says, reassuringly. \u201cIt\u2019s just emotionally draining to write music and constantly tap into your psyche. No musician is writing music for themselves to listen to. It\u2019s a dialogue, a conversation, a connection. I\u2019m creating something for people to react to.\u201d\nwith support from: Girl Friday"}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109-5519", "Artist": "Matt and Kim", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9146040.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421386, 37.787858], "Date": "Mon Nov 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-04", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Pop, Indie, Pop, Alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Regency Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "For many bands, making music is all about the routine of recording an annual album, or being able to tour in progressively bigger venues. Not Matt and Kim. \"Our goal is to make music we want to hear,\" says Matt Johnson, who co-founded the band with Kim Schifino. \"When it comes time to make a new album, I'm just so excited, since I know we have all these ideas and I just want to get them out there.\" As for the band's extra-emphatic live shows, which these days happen in large venues, he explains, \"We've always just really enjoyed playing music, and things have kept growing.\" Matt and Kim's enthusiasm comes across loud and clear on the band's new album, Lightning, its most diverse and developed to date. From the relentless drive of \u201cNow\u201d to the dance-fueled beat of \u201cLet\u2019s Go\u201d to the more contemplative \u201cTen Dollars I Found,\u201d Lightning is the strongest distillation yet of Matt and Kim\u2019s unique sound: a spunky hybrid of indelible songs, an emphatic beat and almost tangible energy, mixed with the duo\u2019s influence of listening nonstop to Top 40 Hip-Hop and pop-punk. To make the album, Matt and Kim spent six months working in their home studio in Brooklyn, producing the record themselves. Lightning is a touch more minimal than their earlier work \u2013 with layers taken away, instead of added, enabling its intense performances and memorable tunes to really come to the forefront. \u201cWhat\u2019s made the songs on this album really strong is we\u2019ve been able to pull a lot off \u2013 to not have so much going on \u2013 and still have a strong song,\u201d Kim explains. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to make a song with a lot going on,\u201d Matt adds. \u201cIt feels very safe. It\u2019s like putting on a lot of clothes: you feel all covered up so no one can judge just one aspect of it, but when you try to break it down to be as simple as can be, you\u2019re really baring it all. When you can see clearly what\u2019s going on, those are the times that the songs are easiest to connect to.\u201d Connecting with their audience is certainly a key focus for Matt and Kim. The indie dance duo\u2019s live shows \u2013 which are legendary for constant, in-your-face exuberance \u2013 feel more like vibrant, sweaty loft parties than traditional concerts, for both audiences and the band. \u201cI think we\u2019ve managed to continue to make them feel intimate,\u201d says Matt. \u201cWhen we first started playing venues instead of playing on the floor at parties, we tried hard to keep the vibe of \u2018we\u2019re all doing this together and having a wild time\u2019 going. The show is not just the two of us: it\u2019s the 3002 of us, or however big the venue is.\u201d Or, as in the words of Rolling Stone: \u201cMatt and Kim\u2019s reputation as a live act precedes them \u2013 and justifiably so. Simply put, they are a two-person dynamo, frantic, tightly wound, and full of good cheer. Their performances are as physical as they are musical. . . . For sheer adrenaline-per-second, no other band comes close.\u201d The band started in 2004, essentially by accident when Matt and Kim were art students at the prestigious Pratt Institute, where they studied film and illustration, respectively. When Kim wanted to learn to play drums and Matt (who'd been in bands before) was getting his head around a new keyboard, the band was born. Since then, they have earned a Gold Record for the upbeat, stick-in-your-head track \"Daylight,\" played festivals like Coachella, Lollapalooza, and Bonnaroo, along with international festivals like V (U.K), Pukkelpop (Belgium), Fuji (Japan), Big Day Out (Australia), Primavera (Spain), Oya (Norway), SWU (Brazil), as well as hundreds of shows. They have won 3 MTV awards: a Breakthrough Video Music Award and mtvU Best Video Woodie Award for \u201cLessons Learned\u201d, as well as a 2011 award for Best Live Band. Lightning is the band's fourth album, following Sidewalks, Grand, and their self-titled debut. Matt and Kim have always been inspired by Brooklyn\u2019s general urban din as well as the area\u2019s artists, yet Matt points out, \u201cI don\u2019t think a place can define a person. We simply write songs about us and our life so that\u2019s why where we live comes up.\u201d Indeed, there\u2019s something universal about a song with a beat that grabs you, with a great melody, played by a band that simply loves to play music. And that, in Williamsburg and way beyond, is the key to the universal appeal of Matt and Kim.

Her style fuses influences from the Isle of Skye and Cape Breton Island with Americana grooves and musical innovations, creating a cutting-edge acoustic sound that retains the integrity and spirit of the Scottish tradition. Hanneke\u2019s music is a blend of the contemporary and traditional, described by the Boston Globe as \u201cexuberant and rhythmic, somehow wild and innocent, delivered with captivating melodic clarity and an irresistible playfulness.\u201d\n\nA prolific composer, Hanneke writes music from personal experiences of love and loss as well as to commemorate the joys and sorrows in the lives of loved ones. Hanneke\u2019s latest release, Trip to Walden Pond, features traditional Scottish and Cape Breton tunes and seventeen new pieces composed in the Scottish idiom. While her lively style is very much evident, this new album carries a deep, soulful sound with songs of celebration and farewell. Produced by Finnish musician Antti J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 (FRIGG, JPP, Baltic Crossing), the album showcases long-time musical collaborators cellist Mike Block, guitarists Keith Murphy and Christopher Lewis, fiddler/violist Jeremy Kittel, and pianist Dave Wiesler. Antti J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 contributes guitar and piano to a couple of tracks and piper Samppa Saarinen is featured on the uilleann pipes. Trip to Walden Pond, similar to Hanneke\u2019s five previous albums, offers mellifluous arrangements of traditional fiddle music and original tunes that evoke humor and heart. This latest album also includes several compositions penned by Hanneke as commissions to benefit Many Hopes, a children\u2019s education nonprofit based in Kenya that she avidly supports.\n\nA native of Port Orford, Oregon, Hanneke started out as a Texas-style fiddler and went on to win the 1997 U.S. National Scottish Fiddle Championship, which awarded her the opportunity to study with Alasdair Fraser and introduced her to fiddle camps and the folk community -- both of which continue to play an integral role in her life. Hanneke teaches regularly at Fraser\u2019s Valley of the Moon and Sierra Fiddle Camps, the Mike Block String Camp (run by her husband, acclaimed cellist Mike Block), Harald Haugaard\u2019s International Fiddle School, and the Boston Harbor Scottish Fiddle School. She has served as a guest instructor in the American Roots department at Berklee College of Music, where she received her Bachelor\u2019s of Music in Violin Performance.\n\nHanneke is a sought-after performer who has graced stages across North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. She has been featured at Celtic Connections (Glasgow, Scotland), KVMR Celtic Fest (Grass Valley, USA), Milwaukee Irish Fest (Milwaukee, USA), Celtic Colours (Cape Breton, Canada), WGBH Christmas Celtic Sojourn (Boston, USA) and the National Celtic Festival (Port Arlington, Australia). The Hanneke Cassel Band features Mike Block on cello and alternating guitarists Keith Murphy and Christopher Lewis.\n\nIn addition to performing with her own band, Hanneke has been featured on PBS with Boston-based fiddle band Childsplay and has performed with Baroque/Celtic group Ensemble Galilei at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (with former NPR \u2018Talk of the Nation\u2019 host Neal Conan) and the National Geographic in Washington, D.C.

The L.A-based quartet, founded by bassist Libby Hsieh and guitarist Vera Ellen after they met at a UCLA house party a couple of years back, operates collectively, each member taking turns at the microphone and equal parts in songwriting; they\u2019re all big personalities and big presences, but they find balance\u2014and complement\u2014in one another. There had been iterations of the band before, but none had truly clicked until drummer Virginia Pettis and guitarist Sierra Scott joined. This is the iteration of the band found on Girl Friday\u2019s new EP, Fashion Conman; in four nimble tracks, these young women are able to fuse mod-pop a la the early Bangles with \u201890s alt-rock (\u201cwe all love Hole,\u201d they say with enthusiasm), the urgency and tension of minimalist \u201870s post-punk, and contemporary observations, without sounding like pastiche. They\u2019re uninterested in genre designations, and hope nobody\u2019s ever able to pinpoint them in a word.\n\nThe feminist collective, of course, is a storied radical tradition, tied closely to the practice of consciousness-raising, in which collective members shared stories of their own lives in order to find commonality, learn one another\u2019s perspectives, analyze systems of oppression, and find imaginative and active solutions. On Fashion Conman, Girl Friday are coming of age, trying to find their footing in a world in which image is clearly prized over substance. None of them are L.A. natives\u2014they take aim at the noted sinister shallowness of entertainment industry interactions in that city on \u201cDecoration/Currency,\u201d which swings easily from sweetly melodic verse to distorted, fist-raising chorus. \u201cHeadstones\u201d and \u201cLullaby No. 13\u201d point not just to a nightmarish present but to the possibility of escape, of finding safety with one another. \u201cGeneration Sick\u201d is a pointed indictment of abusive men and all those who protect them. (These songs are also, it should be noted, wickedly catchy).\n\nGirl Friday are a band out of time\u2014sensitive, perceptive, careful songwriters who feel displaced in this moment, but find comfort and resilience in their friendships with one another and the music they make together.

But it wasn\u2019t always like this. Back in the \u201890s, Suffocation maniacs waited, at most, two years between old and new fixes of New York-styled brutality. Landmark full-length Effigy of the Forgotten was only two years removed from debut EP, Human Waste. Likewise, Breeding the Spawn slayed posers and pretenders a year and a half after Effigy of the Forgotten blueprinted Suffocation into the history books. And Pierced from Within, the wickedest death metal put to tape in the mid-\u201890s, slammed fist first into mediocrity and mundanity two years after Breeding the Spawn. Clearly, there were times when Suffocation\u2019s march towards total annihilation was fast and furious.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t put out records every two years now,\u201d asserts long-time Suffocation guitarist and primary songwriter Terrance Hobbs. \u201cFor one, we don\u2019t need to. Two, we tour more now than we did in the early days. And three, we\u2019re no longer in our twenties. We all have lives and families now. Plus, I enjoy writing things and letting them organically mature. For example, I started writing songs for Of the Dark Light right after Pinnacle of Bedlam.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver since I joined, Suffocation\u2019s been on pretty heavy album and tour cycles,\u201d bassist and lyric writer Derek Boyer agrees. \u201cSometimes the charisma was there, sometimes it wasn\u2019t. We\u2019d be on the road for a year, and only after that, we\u2019d think about putting songs together. Then, we\u2019d get pulled back on the road. That would delay the album cycle. So, our album cycle went from every two years to every three years to now every four years. Pinnacle of Bedlam came out in 2013. That\u2019s a long time ago.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it was. When Pinnacle of Bedlam hit store shelves in the winter 2013, the world was proverbially on its knees. North Korea was conducting underground nuclear tests, a meteor hit a city in Russia\u2019s South Urals, and Benedict XVI resigned as Pope, the first to intentionally do so since 1294. All this pandemonium occurred the same month Suffocation unfurled Pinnacle of Bedlam unto the world. Harbinger of doom it was. Four years later, the blue marble we inhabit is certifiably nuttier and more violent. It\u2019s the perfect vehicle for Of the Dark Light, a full-length that not only welcomes new members\u2014drummer Eric Morotti and guitarist Charlie Errigo\u2014but also sees Hobbs writing the craziest, cruelest Suffocation material since Effigy of the Forgotten.\n\n\u201cNow, bands are very cutting edge,\u201d Hobbs observes. \u201cSo, we felt we had to step up our game a little bit. Still be unique, but I will say we\u2019re still using the same formula we\u2019ve been using since Suffocation formed. It\u2019s just ramped up. There are some new things in there that I hope the fans will hear. They\u2019ll have to really listen to the album to hear it though. With the new guys, I had to consider their input. Really, in a nutshell, it came down to the chemistry I had with Charlie and Eric. It was a bonus, to me, that I had players that were really into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTerrance is the majority songwriter, where I\u2019m the majority lyric writer,\u201d offers Boyer. \u201cI\u2019ll get Hobbs to help me out with some lyrics or he\u2019ll ask me to for my input on his songwriting ideas. We collaborate really well together. Now that we have some newer cats, we started playing live. We immediately thought, \u2018Fuck, we need to have a new record out.\u2019 So, we slammed everybody into the same room to finalize the album. Sure, we could\u2019ve put out the album a long time ago, but the chemistry is so good now, I can\u2019t imagine what this album would\u2019ve sounded like without them.\u201d\n\nWritten over a four-year span but finalized in the studio\u2014\u201cbells and whistles\u201d, Hobbs calls it\u2014Of the Dark Light ups Suffocation\u2019s already ridiculous ante. The first song written, \u2018The Warmth within the Dark\u2019, is just as powerful, technical, and savage as the last song written, \u2018Caught between Two Worlds\u2019. It\u2019s hard to believe members Frank Mullen and Hobbs were doing this in their teens. Now, almost three decades later, Suffocation are more intense, have more fire, and can still out-riff, out-growl, and out-blast younger bands mimeoed off classics like Despise the Sun and Blood Oath.\n\n\u201cI like \u2018Some Things Should Be Left Alone\u2019 and \u2018Of the Dark Light\u2019,\u201d Hobbs reveals. \u201cPeople should take into consideration when driving into work and playing this record. I don\u2019t want people out road raging too much. There\u2019s no need to plow into somebody at 155 miles per hour while playing this record. This album has a lot of gas to it. Listen to it on your headphones at the gym instead. I think the Suffocation fan are really going enjoy it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA band like Suffocation isn\u2019t going to introduce clean vocals or synthesizer,\u201d says Boyer. \u201cThat\u2019s just not who we are. This is Suffocation\u2019s formula. This is the Suffocation fans have known to come and love. We\u2019re not going to stray too far off that path. We have a focal point. We\u2019re a death metal band. We\u2019ve always been kind of quick and technical. We didn\u2019t want to lose that. We just wanted to make all that more exciting, more alive on Of the Dark Light.\u201d\n\nTo put Of the Dark Light to so-called \u2018tape\u2019, the band holed up\u2014for the fifth time\u2014at Joe Cincotta\u2019s Full Force Studios (Waking the Cadaver, Mortal Decay) in Long Island, New York. From the beginning of December 2016 to just after Christmas, Suffocation mercilessly laid down tracks like \u2018Your Last Breaths\u2019, \u2018Return to the Abyss\u2019, \u2018Some Things Should Be Left Alone\u2019, and a re-make of Breeding the Spawn bruiser \u2018Epitaph of the Credulous\u2019. To make sure everything was \u201ctight\u201d, Suffocation rehearsed for almost a month before hitting up Cincotta\u2019s studio. Old habits, turns out, are hard to break.\n\n\u201cWhere I come from, everybody has to sit down and learn the material,\u201d Hobbs levels. \u201cPractice it. Once we have it locked down as a band, then we can think about approaching the studio to record it. For us, we tried to take that same approach. It took a little more time than usual. Also, we wanted an organic sound. There\u2019s so much you can do with technology these days. Any band can sit behind a computer and piece together songs and it\u2019ll probably sound pretty great. We wanted Of the Dark Light to sound like Suffocation not a computer.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe goes back to Souls to Deny,\u201d Boyer remembers. \u201cHe was a buddy. It was after that album where we started touring the world, going to places Suffocation had never been to before. On those tours, Joe was the soundman. It\u2019s likely if we had a slamming and heavy sound in the 2000s, it\u2019s because our soundman was our producer. He knew the band, he knew the material, so it\u2019s clear he knew how it should sound in a live setting. From Souls to Deny to Of the Dark Light, we\u2019ve done our music with Joe at Full Force.\u201d\n\nTo perfect Of the Dark Light, Suffocation shipped off the recordings to Chris \u2018Zeuss\u2019 Harris to mix and master. Suffocation wanted a clear yet punishing sound. So, as with Pinnacle of Bedlam so too with Of the Dark Light. Having recently worked with death metal legends Six Feet Under, hardcore heroes Hatebreed, and tech-thrashers Revocation, Zeuss knew exactly what to put in and extract out of Suffocation for the group\u2019s eighth full-length. Songs like \u2018Clarity through Deprivation\u2019, \u2018Return to the Abyss\u2019, and \u2018The Violation\u2019 have a particularly strong bite.\n\n\u201cWe knew, as a friend of the band and a fellow East Coaster, Chris would get what we were aiming for,\u201d says Hobbs. \u201cI\u2019d say this is a full Suffocation endeavor with some outside help, particularly where it concerned Zeuss. It turned out great working with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had Zeuss doing the mixing and mastering for Pinnacle, so it made sense for him to reprise his role on Of the Dark Light,\u201d Boyer states. \u201cI thought Pinnacle sounded great, but after I compared it to Of the Dark Light, it smokes Pinnacle.\u201d\n\nBut if there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s different about Of the Dark Light, it\u2019s the vocals. Founding member and vocalist Frank Mullen is the main vocalist, but his successor, contributing vocalist Kevin Muller (The Merciless Concept / ex-Pyrexia), also has skin the Suffocation game. That being said, Mullen\u2019s contributions were almost not meant to be. The story goes Mullen voiced his concerns about appearing on the follow-up to Pinnacle of Bedlam while hanging at a local bowling alley with Hobbs, Boyer, new guitarist Charlie Errigo, and a few friends. Frank said to his bandmates, \u2018Yo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do the new record!\u2019 They were quick to respond, \u2018Come on, Frank!\u2019 A little coercing later, Mullen and Muller would brutalize their way through Boyer\u2019s transcendental death-wish lyrics.\n\n\u201cFrank will always be part of Suffocation,\u201d assures Hobbs. \u201cHe can come in and record just fine. It\u2019s the touring. He can\u2019t be gone for five-six weeks at a clip. That\u2019s not good for his job or his family. If you trace this back to the when the economy crashed in 2008, the likelihood of Frank getting out on tour became less of an option. I give him credit. He does what\u2019s right for Frank and his family. He\u2019s been a part of the band since the beginning. And he\u2019ll always be a part of the band.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrank always comes in with a few jabs,\u201d Boyer laughs. \u201cLike for this record, he said, \u2018What in the hell did you idiots put together on this one?!\u2019 He\u2019s funny. Every time, he\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not doing this again!\u2019 Then, after it all comes together, he\u2019s like, \u2018Ah, this is so sick!\u2019 But Frank isn\u2019t always going to be able to play live with us. So, we\u2019ve brought on Kevin. He actually appeared on a lot of parts on Of the Dark Light. Long-time fans may not even notice there are parts with Kevin singing. He sounds just like Frank. Frank actually called me right after we got the master and said, \u2018Fuck! Does Kevin sing on every goddamned song?!\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, not all of them.\u2019 Kevin knocked it out of the park on this record.\u201d\n\nAs for respite, there is no respite with Suffocation. Musically or lyrically. Conceptually, Of the Dark Light deals with transcendence, the shedding of the physical skin to achieve another plane of existence. But the lyrics originate not from a land of colors, incense, and feel-good vibes. Former labelmates Cynic have already covered that to great success. No, Suffocation, as expected, sourced their metaphysical prose from the depths of darkness.\n\n\u201cI wrote a lot about transcendence, leaving the physical body,\u201d tells Boyer. \u201cThere are planes of existence you can\u2019t go with the physical body. The only way to escape it is to end your life, not just of natural causes. There\u2019s a suicidal theme to Of the Dark Light. But it\u2019s not like we sit around thinking about or promoting suicide. No, we\u2019re really talking about transcendence and what happens after.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a few songs on Of the Dark Light that are about loosely, I think, horror movie topics,\u201d Hobbs adds. \u201cWe\u2019re a death metal band. But the majority of the lyrics deal with transcending everything through death. Transcending our physical form. There\u2019s touches of the Tibetan Book of the Dead to the lyrics. I mean, we prepare our whole lives to just pass away. What happens next? I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find out sooner or later.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "201 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Belphegor", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9413921.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.276635, 37.796434], "Date": "Tue Nov 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-05", "Genre": "Genres: DIABOLICAL DEATH, BLACK METAL ART", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Oakland Metro", "moreBioInfo": "\"BELPHEGOR - DIABOLICAL DEATH MUSICK since 1993\"\n\n\n\nBELPHEGOR have risen to icon status when it comes to \"Death/ Black Metal Art\"!!

Established in 2012, and based in East Nashville, TN, they record and perform a varied and unique style of folky, garage-infused rhythm & blues. Using primal foot percussion, complex, fuzzed-out, finger-picked guitar patterns, warbled harmonicas, tasty harmonies and A LOT of tambourine, they are able to create something rugged and visceral- a modern interpretation of early blues, soul, and rock 'n' roll music that harkens back to the traditions of hazy front porch folk songs as well as raucous back-alley juke joints.\n\nThe duo has traveled over 150,000 road miles, playing over 800 shows across America, Europe, and Canada, all in the last five years. In addition to their own headlining shows, they have toured as support for bands such as the Dixie Chicks (25 dates in the US and Canada in 2016/2017), The Record Company, and Jamestown Revival.\n\nTheir eponymous debut album garnered attention from media outlets such as Nashville's independent radio, WRLT Lightning 100, as well as publications like American Songwriter and RELIX Magazine. They were also selected over thousands of other bands to perform at the 2015 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, TN, headlined by Billy Joel, Mumford & Sons, Ben Harper & The Innocent Criminals, and more. In addition, the music of Smooth Hound Smith has been featured on CMT\u2019s Nashville, MTV\u2019s The Real World and the Esquire Network.\n\nSmooth Hound Smith's second full-length album, Sweet Tennessee Honey, was released in 2016, and features appearances by Natalie Maines (Dixie Chicks), Sarah Jarosz, and Jano Rix (The Wood Brothers).

Florida Georgia Line) and \u201cThe Way I Talk\u201d lays his cards out on the table: Work hard. Love hard. Party down. Respect the past and make your own future. ... Know yourself. \u201cI\u2019ve never been the type of person who\u2019s goodat getting my feelings out, so for me music is a way to do that,\u201d Wallen explains. \u201cI just hope people get to know me and see my true colors.\u201dStill only 24 years old, those colors have already started to show. Working with a vocal blend which marks the spot where interstate blacktop changes over to gravelly, Smoky Mountain backroads, Wallen\u2019s a rock and hip-hop loving country boy with a sound straight out of the modern South. He mixes boondock bangers, amped-up anthems and sensitive, shade-tree poetry like a one-man playlist. He\u2019s a fireball onstage, thrilling stadium crowds with superstars like Florida Georgia Line and Luke Bryan and headlining his own 2018 Up Down Tour. He\u2019s a chart-topping songwriter with his name on tracks like Jason Aldean\u2019s \u201cYou Make It Easy,\u201d a Grand Ole Opry performer and an artist on the fast track with over 100 million Spotify streams, earning the respect of legends like Bill Anderson and country\u2019s new generation at the same time.Born and raised in the tiny, two-stoplight town of Sneedville, Tennessee, Wallen began singing in his father\u2019s church at 3 years old and was writing songs by 18, melding a variety of influences right from the start. Sneedville is the home of bluegrass icon Jimmy Martin and Wallen went to the same highschool as Kenny Chesney. But while his mother loved Christian music and he was into rap, his dad was a hard rocker all the way \u2013laying the foundation for his son\u2019s own fearless creative identity.\u201cIt\u2019s not something you would expect \u2013a Southern Baptistpreacher who loves Bad Company \u2013but I think that\u2019s part of what makes him genuine,\u201d Wallen explains. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the kind of preacher who was throwing judgment toward anybody. He just found a way that helped him and he wanted to help other people, and if he liked a little rock-and-roll, then so be it. I looked up to it all.\u201dThat willingness to break the mold peppers IF I KNOW ME, filled with equal parts confident charm and heartfelt vulnerability. Wallen co-wrote 6 of the album\u2019s 14 tracks, working with established country hit makers like Craig Wiseman and Jessi Alexander, up and comers like\nMichael Hardy and crossover-rap tunesmiths like Ernest K. and Ryan Vojtesak (Kanye West, Young Thug, Post Malone).Produced by studio ace Joey Moi \u2013who also helped FGL, Jake Owen and Nickelback develop their bold sonic presence \u2013Morgan didn\u2019t bother trying to classify his work by genre. Instead he focused on feel, with swagger and sensitivity, heartbreak and desire all taking their place.\u201cLike a lot of people my age, I didn\u2019t necessarily grow up listening to country music ... I grew up living it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe songs I wrote came from the heart, and I don\u2019t really pay attention to what\u2019s going on outside of what I\u2019m doing. I just try to stick to what I know and what I love.\u201dWith the album\u2019s slow-burning title track, what Wallen knows and loves comes into view. Anchored by a tight, Top 40 club beat and a gotta-have-you theme, the song is all rhythm and quick hitting come-ons as Wallen looks to start a romance that lasts longer than just one night.\u201cIt\u2019s perfect for my first album,\u201d Wallen says. \u201cLike, \u2018If I know me, then here\u2019s what you get.\u2019\u201dHis anthemic 2016 breakout, \u201cThe Way I Talk,\u201d takes a drawling look at putting your money where your mouth is, while \u201cUp Down\u201d \u2013the irresistible thumper that features Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley of Florida Georgia Line \u2013feels like typical Friday in Wallen\u2019s mountain-valley hometown. Climbing up country radio, SiriusXM and digital streaming charts alike, it\u2019s full of distorted twang, pounding drums, sly vocals and references to \u201cHoldin\u2019 it down here in \u2018B.F.E.\u2019\u201d\u201cSome people have asked me, \u2018What\u2019s B.F.E.?\u2019 And if you don\u2019t know, you just don\u2019t know,\u201d Wallen says with a laugh. \u201cI love a good time, I love to drink a little bit, I love being with my friends and I love fishing. Life is hard enough already, so if you can find a song that takes you away from that for three or four minutes, it\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\u201cHad Me at Halftime\u201d scores with a heartfelt Hail Mary, \u201cIf I Ever Get You Back\u201d updates the feel-good spirit of \u201890s country, and \u201cRedneck Love Song\u201d grooves with ablue-collar promise of everlasting love.Meanwhile, \u201cHappy Hour\u201d toasts a relationship that was doomed from the start, mixing on-the-rocks lyrics and melodies into a potent, pure-country anthem. \u201cChasin\u2019 You\u201d smolders with the residual heat of a top-shelf bourbon, and \u201cWhiskey Glasses\u201d fuses sludgy guitars to a concept that\u2019s basically a low-down, broken-hearted play on the idea behind beer goggles. But with its booming beat, swampy guitars and sideways lyrics all about the country-boy good life \u2013plus a nod to Nitty Gritty Dirt Band\u2019s archetypal country-rocker, \u201cFishin\u2019 in the Dark\u201d \u2013\u201cWhatcha Know About That\u201d lies at the album\u2019s thematic heart. It\u2019s a place where being true to yourself is more important than playing by someone else\u2019s rules. And that\u2019s something Wallen knows all about.\u201cThe song pays homage to the past, but I\u2019m damn near rapping in part of it,\u201d he explains, honored that the Grammy-winning Dirt Band \u2013envelope pushing game changers in their own right \u2013gave the track their support. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I love about country music right now. You get to express yourself and do what you want, and I think that\u2019s why country is bigger now than it ever has been.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "321 Golf Club Rd, Pleasant Hill, CA 94523", "Artist": "Daniel Summerhill", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8505452.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.070719, 37.971324], "Date": "Wed Nov 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 AM", "Venue": "Diablo Valley College", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Night", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8002126.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Wed Nov 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-06", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Hard Rock", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "New album 'Raft of the World' out now!

We met in 2017 thanks to the amazing local jam and performance scene. Our shared values around working together to elevate our music to levels we couldn\u2019t reach on our own resulted in our name, The High Water Line.\n\nHailing from upstate New York, holding down the Banjo spot, and singing with his powerful baritone voice, is Tyler Stegall. Tyler's driving banjo style propels the band along no matter the tempo. Clare Armenante comes from The Garden State. A classical violin player, she is both at home playing for symphonies and taking amazing breaks over traditional bluegrass music. Not only is Clare amazing on the fiddle, but she can sing all the parts better than the rest of the band put together. Also from New Jersey, the man responsible for keeping the band in time and bringing the funk, is bass player and singer Jim Toggweiler. Helping to keep the band moving is mandolin player Tj Carskadon, from WI. Tj\u2019s harmony singing and driving backbeat help to define The High Water Line\u2019s unique rhythmic feel. Last, but certainly not least, is our amazing guitar player all the way from Monroe, Georgia, Joel Cofield. The way Joel seamlessly blends blues with both traditional and modern bluegrass guitar styles, combined with his fantastic harmony and lead singing, round out HWL\u2019s sound and help bring it a flavor all its own.\n\nYou can find our demo recording included in this packet and on soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/the-high-water-line.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "999 California St, San Francisco, CA 94108", "Artist": "Ricardo Scales", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.410248, 37.791405], "Date": "Wed Nov 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Top of the Mark", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ricardo Scales at Top of the Mark: This famed martini bar offers high-class wallpaper music on the weekends, including lounge piano, easy listening, classical, and some jazz combos.

It's the same kind of self-assurance the soft-spoken Rodgers displays on his second independently released EP, available January 19th. Produced by Mickey Jack Cones (Dustin Lynch, Joe Nichols) and Chris Farren, the five-song collection showcases him as both a talented writer and interpreter, merging the electrified rock he heard on the baseball diamond with the thoughtful lyricism of country. Well before he was singing for his supper, the Batesville, Mississippi native was an accomplished baseball player who was a scholarship athlete at Northwest Mississippi Community College. Raised in the midst of country's '90s commercial heyday \u2013 his first concert was Garth Brooks at the Pyramid in Memphis \u2013 Rodgers always had an inkling that he might end up living in Music City, he just didn't know how or when. \"I can remember in high school I would tell people \u2013 this was before I played guitar or anything \u2013 I would just be like, 'Yeah, I'm gonna move to Nashville one day,'\" he recalls. And so he did, departing Mississippi with one of his college buddies to see if he could make it in Music City. Through the countless open mic nights and lean years that inevitably followed, Rodgers was able to develop the songwriting voice that would eventually earn his first publishing deal with Combustion Music. \"I went into songwriting boot camp,\" he says. \"That's all I did. I hardly played any shows or anything. I just focused on writing.\" In the meantime, Rodgers scored his first cut on Florida Georgia Line's Dig Your Roots, with \"Wish You Were on It.\" He also released his self-titled EP, featuring the streaming hit \"Midnight Daydream.\" All that intense focus shows on his second self titled EP. Opening track \"Ain't Really Over\" depicts a man in the hangover stage of a rough breakup and trying to move on. Framed by surging, distorted electric guitars and Rodgers' bluesy howl, it sets the tone for his melody-rich, introspective style of songwriting. On \"Cold Case,\" Rodgers draws a line between himself and country's long tradition of clever wordplay. Bouncing off the title's suggestion of criminal investigations, he's popping tops and pining over a woman who's up and vanished from his life. His solution? Downing as many beers as he can handle. \"'Cold Case' was just one of those things \u2013 somebody started playing a guitar and one of us just spit it out,\" says Rodgers. \"It kind of fell out of thin air.\" Rodgers' clear sense of his artistic identity also shines through on the outside songs \"Like You've Been There Before\" and \"Some Girls.\" It's easy to envision Rodgers singing about a younger version of himself in \"Like You've Been There Before,\" a rebellious kid getting some sage advice from his father to play it cool whether he's knocking a fastball over the fences or cautiously taking his first trip around the bases with a young woman. He sings it with the easy confidence of a seasoned vet, or as he says in the chorus, \"like it ain't no thing.\" \"Some Girls,\" on the other hand, calls back to \"Ain't Really Over\" except this time he's ended things and she's not handling it well \u2013 talking behind his back and playing childish games on social media. \"Some girls make it easy on you,\" he sighs, \"and some girls never do.\" The female woes reach their apex in the Rodgers co-write \"Missing One,\" which flips the title phrase on its head.

Hitchhiking across the country exposed Crockett to the street life at a young age, following in the footsteps of his relative, American folk hero Davy Crockett, who also lived a wild life on the American frontier. After train hopping across the country, singing on the streets for change in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter, busking in New York City and performing across Texas and Northern California, Crockett set off to travel the world and lived on the streets of Paris for nearly a year before searching for home in Spain, Morocco, and Northern Africa.\n\nThe blues artist returned home to Texas and released his debut solo album titled A Stolen Jewel in 2015, receiving critical acclaim in Dallas and ultimately landing him a Dallas Observer Music Award that year for \u201cBest Blues Act\u201d. A record \u201crich with Southern flavor, a musical gumbo of Delta blues, honky-tonk, gospel and Cajun jazz,\u201d Jewel proved that Crockett, born into poverty in the Rio Grande, had come home to make his musical mark on the South. Crockett, who is self-described as elusive, rebellious and self-taught, has been compared to legends like Bill Withers, Merle Haggard, and Gary Clark Jr.\n\nHe released his sophomore record In The Night, an admirable nod to his Texas country and Louisiana blues roots, in 2016 and played over 125 shows that year. \u201cIn the Night\u201d and Crockett\u2019s song \u201cI Am Not Afraid\u201d received international recognition from top tastemakers after being picked by NPR Music as one of the \"Top 10 Songs Public Radio Can't Stop Playing\u201d and selected by David Dye to be featured on World Cafe in late July. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram called it \u201can impressive calling card, full of Crockett's plaintive soulfulness and swinging tempos\" and Central Track noted the artist as having \"the well-rounded songwriting capabilities of Van Morrison and a vocal approach that finds common ground between Bill Withers and early Dr. John.\" Crockett graced the cover of Buddy Magazine in May 2016, who called him \u201cthe archetype of the new American vagabond.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, he\u2019s spent the year building a large fan base across the country with his much talked about live show while selling out shows in his native Texas and surrounding states. He\u2019s remained on the road most of the year appearing at top festivals like Pilgrimage and Americana Music Fest, as well as touring with the Turnpike Troubadours, Lucero, ShinyRibs, Samantha Fish, Old 97\u2019s, and others.\n\nIn all this, he still found time to get back to Austin, Texas to record a collection of his favorite honky tonk songs called Charley Crockett presents Lil G.L.\u2019s Honky Tonk Jubilee which will be his first release under his new label deal with Thirty Tigers(Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson). The album drops 9/8/2017, and features songs originally performed by Hank Williams, Ernest Tubbs, Loretta Lynn, Tanya Tucker, Roy Acuff, Webb Pierce, and other great heroes of honky tonk. \u201cPlaying on the streets of New Orleans I heard traditional Jazz, Blues and Country all day long. Young folks were playing it everywhere. Especially the travelers. New York, Nashville, Texas, the Colorado Rockies, California.\u201d Crockett said. \u201c I love this music. It's the blues and it feels good to sing. A lot of folks are imitating this sound and for good reason. It's the American struggle. It has the kind of soul that's hard to find nowadays and all I know is you gotta get a lot of mud on you before you can make folks believe you when you sing these songs. You just can't fake it.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2313 Oak Grove Rd, Walnut Creek, CA 94598", "Artist": "Carly Thomas", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8562311.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.01641, 37.92446], "Date": "Thu Nov 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-07", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Acoustic, Folk, Pop, Singer, Songwriter, Musician, singer-songwriter, Indie Alternative, Canadiana, Americana", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Mike Hess Brewing Walnut Creek", "moreBioInfo": "Carly Thomas is an accomplished singer/songwriter who was born in Thailand and raised in Argentina, France, and various parts of North America.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE.

He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

I live in San Francisco, have since 1998. My touring band and the musicians I've recorded with over the years are always changing, though many friends and players have stayed with me over albums and tours. The one constant has been Thom Monahan who has engineered and co-produced every Vetiver album. Thom lives in L.A., where most of Complete Strangers was recorded. The album came together slowly over demos at my home in San Francisco and quick trips to L.A., continuing on with Thom at his studio. It moved in fits and starts for a couple years. Once we had the basic arrangements we jumped in the studio with Bart Davenport, Gabe Noel and Josh Adams for a few days to put down rhythm tracks. That's when the album really took shape. Thom & I fleshed everything out with a few more musicians in San Francisco & L.A. and eventually Complete Strangers arrived. The songs on Complete Strangers bear some resemblance to the album's title. They share things in common but come from different places, different times. \"Stranger Still\" is an anthem for insomniacs, illuminating the hours when the world exceeds our grasp. \"From Now On\" rings out some emotional tinnitus, the moment a night runs away from you, when freedoms turn into responsibilities. The album builds around dualities, the way people pair at parties. \"Current Carry\" percolates with the confidence of love, while \"Confiding\" reveals how vulnerable we are chasing love. \"Backwards Slowly\" and \"Edgar\" are vignettes of transition, more ebb than flow. As with many of Vetiver's better moments, sunshine is only a chord away from melancholy. An introspective lyric underlies an extroverted chorus. Subtlety tries to be outgoing, loneliness familiar, in an effort to connect the dots of life's ellipsis. I'm still figuring the album out. It feels like someone I've just met yet known for a long time. - Andy Cabic http://vetiverse.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "250 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Michelle Musial", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9192649.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.402096, 37.78236], "Date": "Thu Nov 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-07", "Genre": "Genres: Deep House, Progressive House, Techno, Tropical, Left-Field house, Chicago House", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Commons Club SF", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "DJ Commons Club 7pm-11pm"}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109-5519", "Artist": "Fobia (MX)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8547401.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421386, 37.787858], "Date": "Thu Nov 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-07", "Genre": "Genres: Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Regency Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "Due\u00f1os de una extensa y reconocida trayectoria musical respaldada por 30 a\u00f1os de carrera, ocho discos y numerosos reconocimientos, Fobia es ampliamente reconocido por su profesionalismo, calidad y energ\u00eda en todas sus presentaciones, con las que tuvieron oportunidad de visitar diferentes pa\u00edses de Am\u00e9rica Latina y Estados Unidos.

The song has become a standard in choir repertory the world over. Two of her songs appeared on Joan Baez\u2019s Grammy-nominated CD, Day After Tomorrow. In addition to touring in support of her previous release, Roses at the End of Time, in 2011 and 2012 Eliza and label-mates John Gorka and Lucy Kaplansky performed as \u201cFolk Super Trio\u201d Red Horse, a side project whose CD stayed for months at the top of the Folk Music Charts.

Mimiaga\u2019s expertise ranges from opera and jazz to classical, as well as musical theatre, having studied at both Skidmore College and The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music. Her forthcoming record, Swim At Night, was recorded with producer James Riotto (The Mountain Goats, tUnE-yArDs, Ezra Furman) at John Vanderslice\u2019s all-analog facility Tiny Telephone in Oakland.\n\nSwim At Night eschews archaic pop structures as well as Mimiaga\u2019s finely honed vocal technique (developed through years of formal training), opting instead for spontaneity and gut instinct. To achieve this, Mimiaga took up dance lessons to inform her exuberant new method of songwriting. \u201cTaking dance has helped my singing tremendously,\u201d she says. \u201cSince my purpose of writing constantly changes, I want to be a lot more playful and expansive in the way I view a song\u2019s structure. I feel more open and able to be a little less careful, prioritizing feeling above all else. Dancing helps put the music into your body so much more than studied musical technique.\u201d\n\nThe genre-fluid Swim At Night enchants, pushing beyond theory and into the arms of pure, unadulterated expression. Mimiaga compares the moon to her aspirations as an adult, summing up the essence of the title track: \"Beautiful, bright, out of reach and pulling out the darker parts of me, while constantly stirring emotions\u2014the way the moon pulls the tide.\" Mimiaga turns to water as a means of therapy, and often refers to it as a \"liminal space\" that enables her to cope with anxiety and undergo life's transitions, freely. On standout tracks like \u201cBrilhante,\u201d the album also excels at critiquing social media and modern internet culture, using hyperbole to skewer the absurd online bravado of celebrities. \u201cAlone\u201d explores the deep value of solitude amidst the white noise of the modern world, while \u201cTalk to Me\u201d pines for reckless zeal and wrestles with the loss of youth. \u201cI\u2019m at a point where I wanna buy a house and start a family, and that\u2019s a very different place than I\u2019m used to,\u201d Mimiaga says. \u201c'Talk to Me\u2019 is about wanting to hold on to spontaneity and abandon, even though you\u2019re heading into a more serious and stable chapter of your life.\u201d\n\nBlending art rock, folk, jazz and electropop, Swim At Night soundtracks Mimiaga\u2019s thought experiments, employing dreamy textures and stream-of-consciousness lyrics, planning a future as though it were a lucid dream. Nimble synths, shimmering organ, soulful horns, and guitars breezy and occasionally bristling pervade the record, underscoring Mimiaga\u2019s ability to playfully transcend both the complexities and indoctrination of adulthood. Closing track \u201cHold Me Down\u201d brings the record home, translating Mimiaga\u2019s high-spirited array of frenetic pop melodies into a loose, minimal arrangement that draws you in with the soft glow of its creeping tempo, and heartfelt nods to the influence of raga, particularly North Indian classical music.\n\n\"I wanted to write a song about seduction and true seduction brings you to the moment. Musically, I've felt the interplay between space, the melody and drone of certain ragas has that ability to pull you in and give you a sense of peace in it.\"\n\n\nLOUIZA\u2019s Swim at Night is out April 5.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Special Guests TBA", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Thu Nov 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Independent", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"Blanket The Homeless\" Record Release & Benefit Concert"}, {"Address": "23 Petaluma Blvd N, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Tab Benoit", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6367789.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.640098, 38.233411], "Date": "Thu Nov 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-07", "Genre": "Genres: Blues", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Mystic Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "3 X Grammy Nominated, 4 X Blues Music Awards \"Entertainer of the Year\" and 5 X \"Contemporary Male\" Blues Music Award Winner the Legendary Tab Benoit.

After a tangent of stubbornly difficult releases in '17, they returned with something much more refined, an LP entitled \u201cThe Kid\u201d. This release propelled the band into the Sacramento music scene, performing consistently throughout Northern California. In early 2019, songwriting duo Consulo and Levine began writing \u201cSpeedboat Massacre\u201d, a delicate and personal tell-tale series of songs based upon fictional character Tommy and his drug smuggling speedboat, which is scheduled to release later this year. Their music, often humorously dubbed \u201cVape Rock\u201d has grown into something that transcends the young age of the members in the band.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

Purchase and stream at https://themenzingers.ffm.to/helloexile.\n\nSince forming as teenagers in 2006, The Menzingers have shown their strength as rough-and-tumble storytellers, turning out songs equally rooted in frenetic energy and lifelike detail. On their new album Hello Exile, the Philadelphia-based punk band take their lyrical narrative to a whole new level and share their reflections on moments from the past and present: high-school hellraising, troubled relationships, aging and alcohol and political ennui. And while their songs often reveal certain painful truths, Hello Exile ultimately maintains the irrepressible spirit that\u2019s always defined the band.\n\nThe sixth full-length from The Menzingers, Hello Exile arrives as the follow-up to After the Party: a 2017 release that landed on best-of-the-year lists from outlets like Clash and Noisey, with Stereogum praising its \u201calmost unfairly well-written punk songs.\u201d In creating the album, the band again joined forces with producer Will Yip (Mannequin Pussy, Quicksand), spending six weeks recording at Yip\u2019s Conshohocken, PA-based Studio 4. \u201cThat\u2019s the longest amount of time we\u2019ve ever worked with Will,\u201d notes Barnett. \u201cWe wanted to make sure these stories didn\u2019t get lost in the music, so we kept it to a lot of room sounds with the guitar and bass and drums.\u201d\n\nDespite that subtler sonic approach, Hello Exile still rushes forward with a restless urgency\u2014an element in full force on the album-opening \u201cAmerica (You\u2019re Freaking Me Out).\u201d With its pounding rhythms and furious guitar riffs, the viscerally charged track provides a much-needed release for all those feeling frenzied by the current political climate. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a pretty insane time, where all you can think about every single day is \u2018What the hell is going on with this country?\u2019\u201d says Barnett. \u201cBut as I was writing that song I realized that it\u2019s kind of always freaked me out, especially coming-of-age during the Iraq War. I love so much about America, but I think you can\u2019t deny that there are some people in power who are absolutely evil.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on Hello Exile, The Menzingers turn their incisive songwriting to matters of love and romance, exploring the glories and failures of human connection. A wistful piece of jangle-pop, \u201cAnna\u201d paints a portrait of lovesick longing, complete with dreamy recollections of wine-drunk kitchen dancing. And on \u201cStrangers Forever,\u201d the band shifts gears for a searing tribute to parting ways, backing their spiky guitars with brilliantly barbed lyrics (e.g., \u201cMaybe it\u2019s for the better if we both stay strangers forever\u201d).\n\nAn album fascinated with home and displacement and belonging (or the lack thereof), Hello Exile takes its title from its heavy-hearted centerpiece. With its aching vocals, graceful acoustic guitar work, and beautifully lilting melody, \u201cHello Exile\u201d draws inspiration from Anton Chekhov\u2019s \u201cThe Lady with the Dog\u201d (a short story set in the Black Sea resort city of Yalta). \u201cI grew up in a tiny town that\u2019s essentially a cross between a summer-vacation spot for New Yorkers and a retirement home, so for most of my childhood there were always people coming in and out of my life,\u201d says Barnett, who hails from Lake Ariel, PA. \u201cReading that story made me think of how isolating it felt when my friends would leave to go back to the city at the end of the season, and I\u2019d still just be stuck way out there in the woods.\u201d\n\nIn looking back on the songwriting process behind Hello Exile, Barnett points to the starkly confessional \u201cI Can\u2019t Stop Drinking\u201d to illustrate the band\u2019s commitment to total candor. \u201cWe\u2019ve written so many songs about fun times with alcohol\u2014but the older you get, it\u2019s not always fun anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cWith \u2018I Can\u2019t Stop Drinking,\u2019 I wanted to be completely truthful and get away from glorifying anything. Sometimes it\u2019s tough to look at yourself and at others that way, but it felt important to make it as real as possible.\u201d\n\nWith the band achieving that soul-baring intimacy all throughout the album, Hello Exile emerges as The Menzingers\u2019 most emotionally daring work to date. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been in love with good songwriting and the beauty of taking a song to its fullest potential, but with this album I feel like we\u2019re really becoming the band we\u2019ve always wanted to be,\u201d says Barnett. Not only a creative turning point for The Menzingers, that uncompromising honesty helps fulfill their mission of leaving each listener with a potent sense of solidarity. \u201cA lot of these songs are looking at different life challenges\u2014they\u2019re stories of people at some sort of crossroads,\u201d Barnett says. \u201cWe might not have the answers for anybody, but hopefully the songs will help them to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and know that they\u2019re not alone in whatever tough decisions they\u2019re facing.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "4825 Hopyard Rd, Pleasanton, CA 94588", "Artist": "The Billy Martini Show", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9526145.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.901971, 37.692164], "Date": "Fri Nov 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-08", "Genre": "Genres: Original Rock, 70s covers", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Mavericks Country Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "The Billy Martini Show!

I live in San Francisco, have since 1998. My touring band and the musicians I've recorded with over the years are always changing, though many friends and players have stayed with me over albums and tours. The one constant has been Thom Monahan who has engineered and co-produced every Vetiver album. Thom lives in L.A., where most of Complete Strangers was recorded. The album came together slowly over demos at my home in San Francisco and quick trips to L.A., continuing on with Thom at his studio. It moved in fits and starts for a couple years. Once we had the basic arrangements we jumped in the studio with Bart Davenport, Gabe Noel and Josh Adams for a few days to put down rhythm tracks. That's when the album really took shape. Thom & I fleshed everything out with a few more musicians in San Francisco & L.A. and eventually Complete Strangers arrived. The songs on Complete Strangers bear some resemblance to the album's title. They share things in common but come from different places, different times. \"Stranger Still\" is an anthem for insomniacs, illuminating the hours when the world exceeds our grasp. \"From Now On\" rings out some emotional tinnitus, the moment a night runs away from you, when freedoms turn into responsibilities. The album builds around dualities, the way people pair at parties. \"Current Carry\" percolates with the confidence of love, while \"Confiding\" reveals how vulnerable we are chasing love. \"Backwards Slowly\" and \"Edgar\" are vignettes of transition, more ebb than flow. As with many of Vetiver's better moments, sunshine is only a chord away from melancholy. An introspective lyric underlies an extroverted chorus. Subtlety tries to be outgoing, loneliness familiar, in an effort to connect the dots of life's ellipsis. I'm still figuring the album out.

Fans inked vocalist/bassist AJ Perdomo\u2019s words on their skin. Bands cribbed their names from Dangerous Summer song titles. They never broke in the mainstream, but to a rabid underground audience, The Dangerous Summer were a phenomenon.\n\nNow, newly reformed and reunited with Hopeless Records, the band\u2014Perdomo, guitarist Matt Kennedy and drummer Ben Cato\u2014are ready to begin their second chapter with the release of their fourth full-length album in 2018, produced by James Paul Wisner (Underoath, Dashboard Confessional, Paramore).\n\n\u201cIn all of our minds, we thought this was never going to happen again,\u201d Perdomo says. \u201cThere was a point in my life where I thought I was never going to play another Dangerous Summer song again. But the easiest thing in the world is writing music and playing music together. It\u2019s second nature. It feels right again.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s forthcoming album, their first in four years, looks to build on an already accomplished discography. The Dangerous Summer\u2019s first three albums\u20142009\u2019s Reach For The Sun, 2011\u2019s War Paint and 2013\u2019s Golden Record\u2014were more than just critically acclaimed: They were collections of visceral, textured alternative rock that shook audiences to their core with an unrivaled musical heft and lyrical honesty. They were songs that demanded your attention, as catchy as they were introspectively vulnerable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking elements of what people always loved about the band and trying to push the limits and push things forward,\u201d Perdomo explains, noting that the band\u2019s new music is more uplifting and upbeat than the stark, bleak Golden Record, which came at a time of both personal and professional turmoil for the group. \u201cOn Reach For The Sun, we had a lot of inspiring songs,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like right now we need to pull out of this dark veil before we do anything else in our story. We\u2019re pulling out of the darkness, and it\u2019s really inspiring and uplifting.\u201d\n\nSo, as The Dangerous Summer approach the next stage of their career, they do so with an overwhelming optimism that\u2019s never been stronger. This isn\u2019t a rehash: It\u2019s a band acknowledging their past with eyes turned squarely toward the future. Most importantly, it\u2019s a reunion led by the music instead of the ancillary trappings of the industry. In their time away, Perdomo, Kennedy and Cato had plenty of time to figure out who and where they wanted to be, and they\u2019ve all returned to the same place.\n\n\u201cNo one owes us anything,\u201d says Perdomo, who became a father during the band\u2019s hiatus. \u201cWe have to prove ourselves again.

A longtime sailor, Legg also notes that \u201ca lot of my childhood memories are of me and my dad on this little tiny boat, cruising around the New England coast. I spent countless hours just sailing and listening to music, and the feeling of that experience has stayed with me really heavily over the years.\u201d Throughout the album, Goldroom reveals his deep-rooted affinity with the ocean by sculpting expansive arrangements and instilling each song with a serene yet kinetic energy.\n\n\n\nThat energy\u2019s partly sourced from Goldroom\u2019s ingenuity in interlacing live guitar, bass, and percussion into electronic soundscapes to form a sound both forward-pushing and timeless. On West of the West, he further shapes that glossy but groove-heavy sound by tapping into sensibilities of early French house music. \u201cI don\u2019t feel all that influenced by producers on a day-to-day basis\u2014songwriting is what\u2019s important to me, so I\u2019m usually thinking about guys like Tom Petty or Curtis Mayfield\u2014but there\u2019s an innocence to what producers like Daft Punk and Alan Braxe do that appeals to me,\u201d says Legg. And just as those artists show an intense fascination with the pop landscape of the early \u201980s, Goldroom steeps West of the West in its own nostalgia. \u201cI\u2019ve always used music as an escapist device, as a way to try to get back to that feeling of when you were younger and everything was a little more pure and uncomplicated,\u201d he points out.\n\n\n\nOn the album-opening \u201cSilhouette,\u201d for instance, Goldroom brilliantly channels the breezy and bass-powered feel of classic French touch music. Slow-building and warmly intimate, the song bittersweetly muses on \u201cwhat it means to be far away from someone you love and feeling like part of you is missing without them,\u201d as Legg explains.\n\n\n\nFrom start to finish West of the West sustains that dreamy melancholy, a mood informed by Legg\u2019s solo touring as a DJ in recent years. \u201cBeing alone on the road for long stretches of time is a pretty unique experience,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s this dual thing of loving that lifestyle of constantly being in motion, but also missing my family and my friends and feeling pulled back home. That\u2019s definitely something I kept coming back to as I was writing for this record.\u201d Trading off vocals with Irish singer/songwriter Rooty throughout West of the West, Goldroom brings a nuanced emotionality to songs like \u201cBack to You\u201d (a sweetly shimmering feel-good track), \u201cLying to You\u201d (a darkly propulsive number with all the cinematic intensity of an \u201980s pop gem), and \u201cRetrograde\u201d (a gorgeously urgent anthem driven by Rooty\u2019s powerful vocal performance).\n\n\n\nIn creating West of the West, Goldroom aimed to \u201cdig really deep and come up with something more honest and meaningful than what you usually see in dance music.\u201d Aided by his graceful grasp of songcraft, that honesty manifests itself in a spirited vitality also abundant in Goldroom\u2019s energetic live show. (Featuring a full band setup, the Goldroom live set finds Legg backed by a bassist, drummer, and fellow singer as he alternates between guitar and keys.) \u201cIt\u2019s a lot different from older Goldroom stuff, where my primary concern was whether or not the song was going to work on a dance floor,\u201d Legg adds in reflecting on West of the West.\n\n\n\nDebuting with the Angeles EP in 2011, Goldroom emerged soon after the dissolution of Legg\u2019s former band NightWaves. \u201cI\u2019d been writing all these songs but had no outlet for them, so people suggested I start a solo thing,\u201d recalls Legg, who borrowed the name Goldroom from a dive bar in Echo Park (\u201ca good place to get drunk and find answers to all of life\u2019s hardest questions\u201d). Though Goldroom was born from his then-burgeoning infatuation with the electronic world, the project drew closely from Legg\u2019s near-lifelong experience in making music. Raised in Wellesley, Massachusetts, he learned to play cello and guitar as a child and soon started writing his own songs and self-recording on a four-track. At age 15 he had a major musical awakening while teaching sailing on Cape Cod, where a group of college kids turned him on to the \u201960s/\u201970s rock and folk artists who would eventually guide his own songwriting. After heading off to study at the University of Southern California, Legg discovered Air, Daft Punk, and other electronic artists whose music \u201cmade me feel things I didn\u2019t know that I could feel.\u201d He then began his journey toward crafting boldly inventive electronic music with a classic-pop songwriting structure at its core.\n\n\n\nFor Goldroom, the main thrill of West of the West is his success in \u201cmaking a record where I could sit down with an acoustic guitar, play the album all the way through, and still make it work.\u201d But while each song is strong enough to stand unadorned, West of the West\u2019s lush and luminous production ultimately lends the album an even greater emotional depth. \u201cThere\u2019s something really incredible about beautiful chords being played using a stack of nicely tuned synthesizers,\u201d Legg says in discussing his passion for electronic music. \u201cAnd with a drum machine, you can make a kick-drum sound that\u2019s more impactful than any real kick drum. There\u2019s a whole world out there with electronic music, and the thing that gets me most excited as a musician is finding new ways to paint with those palettes while still telling a very human story.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "201 Washington St, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Brain Death", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.643119, 38.23494], "Date": "Fri Nov 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Phoenix Theater", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Frolic | Dirty Rice | Brain Death (final show!) | Group Therapy | Desmodus"}, {"Address": "1000 Great Hwy, San Francisco, CA 94121", "Artist": "Johnny Smith", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.510542, 37.769815], "Date": "Fri Nov 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Beach Chalet Brewery & Restaurant", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Johnny Smith at Beach Chalet Brewery & Restaurant: The occasional jazz bands that play at the Beach Chalet may try valiantly to compete for attention with the Chalet's menu (full dinner served until 11 p.m.), handcrafted brews, and striking coastal view - but with vistas of the Pacific Ocean as epic as these, the musicians face a losing proposition.

Thirty years later, Hiroshima has remained very much in the game. And they\u2019ve done so by sticking to that original philosophy of blending genres to map out and promote unlikely artistic and cultural connections. After three decades, in a time when the globe grows smaller and more connected by the day, and sounds from all over that globe can be found in almost any piece of contemporary music, it appears that the world may finally be catching up with Hiroshima. The band offers a retrospective of those early years with the August 18, 2009, release of Legacy (HUCD 3153) on Heads Up International, a division of Concord Music Group. The album features eleven songs from the first ten years of Hiroshima\u2019s prolific history \u2013 each re-recorded by the band\u2019s current six-member lineup with assistance from four guest artists. At the heart of Legacy \u2013 and of the Hiroshima experience in general \u2013 is the convergence of Eastern and Western music, as forged by saxophonist Dan Kuramoto and koto player June Kuramoto, the founding members whose joint commitment to genre bending and cross-cultural innovation is as solid today as it was on that first recording. \u201cWhen you start looking back at fifteen records over thirty years, that\u2019s a lot of material to choose from,\u201d says Dan Kuramoto. \u201cSo we narrowed the scope to the first ten years, which includes five records \u2013 two of which were gold. We tracked everything live in my home studio for this new recording, with almost no overdubs. In many cases, the songs on this record are fairly similar to the originals. In some cases, they\u2019re very different.\u201d Rounding out the current Hiroshima lineup on Legacy are keyboardist Kimo Cornwell, bassist Dean Cortez, drummer Danny Yamamoto and taiko/percussionist Shoji Kameda. Guest artists \u2013 whom Kuramoto refers to as the band\u2019s \u201cextended family\u201d \u2013 include percussionist Richie Gajate Garcia and vocalists Terry Steele, Yvette Nii and Jim Gilstrap. Despite its retrospective sensibilities, Legacy is by no means a swan song for Hiroshima. Rather, it\u2019s bookend to thirty years of innovative music, and a promise of more great things to come. \u201cI would like to think that there\u2019s a heart and a voice within this music that doesn\u2019t go out of style,\u201d says Kuramoto. \u201cThese songs are as fresh and meaningful to us today as they were the first time they were recorded. They\u2019re not of a particular genre. They are our musical heart. They shift gears from Japanese to jazz to salsa to R&B and beyond. Throughout each piece, you can hear the echoes of all the experiences that have influenced us along the way.\u201d New CD \"J-Town Beat\"!

Play Till You Win, the much anticipated first full-length album by New York songwriter and visual artist Cassandra Jenkins, is coming out April 7 (on Cassandra Complex).\n\n\n\nPlay Till You Win is both an elaboration on and a departure from Cassandra\u2019s previous work, which includes an acclaimed, self-released EP in 2013, singles \u201cRabbit\u201d and \u201cWild World\u201d (a Cat Stevens cover that was prominently featured on the trailer for HBO\u2019s The Returned), and the lusciously orchestrated \u201cPerfect Day\u201d (especially written for Philadelphia\u2019s celebrated Weathervane Music documentary web series Shaking Through).\n\n\n\nHer new songs, described as \"a beautiful blend of smoke and delicacy,\" showcase Cassandra's roots while disarming the listener with lush arrangements and \"warm and woozy guitar\" (Consequence of Sound). Catchy aural ghosts that recall George Harrison\u2019s Dylan-obsessed All Things Must Pass haunt the record's melodies as a constant stylistic lodestar, as cited by co-producer Sam Owens (aka Sam Evian). Woven throughout are nods to Lee Hazlewood\u2019s Hollywood-and-Vine country surrealism as well as Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch\u2019s work for Julee Cruise, resulting in a tapestry that is \"tender and trance like\" (Interview Magazine), both sinister and sincere.\n\n\n\nIt was the Nudie-besuited Gram Parsons, one of several patron saints lovingly looking over and bestowing their grace over Play Till You Win, who famously declared when asked if he played \u201ccountry rock,\u201d that he preferred to call what he played \"cosmic American music\". What makes Cassandra\u2019s new collection stand out from fellow acolytes of psychedelic burritos and dusty journeys through gilded palaces of sin, is that her vision and scope of influences are broad, idiosyncratic and ever-changing. Not to speak of her unique background\u2014she grew up in Manhattan, in a family of jazz musicians. Much like Parsons, Cassandra uses the clarity and smoldering sense of longing conveyed by her \"smokey vocals\" (NPR) to transcend her urban surroundings in order to connect to a deeper, quintessentially American vein of expression.\n\n\n\nAll these aspects and interests coalesce in a truly multilayered album. Her personal, matured exploration of shifting desire, the roles between lovers, and an uneasy sense of narcissism made explicit by Cassandra\u2019s DIY music videos (she handcrafts most of her own art, costumes and videos herself), is also influenced by visual and performance artists like Marcel Dzama, Mike Kelley and Chris Burden, renowned figures of contemporary art who also retain (sometimes tragically) an aura of folk or outsider art. This is not trivial for the aims of Cassandra\u2019s album, a deceptive piece of pop that hides a pretty serious, committed art/occult meditation on self, desire and, yes, ch-ch-ch-changes.\n\n\n\nThe cosmos in Cassandra\u2019s self proclaimed \u201cCosmic American\u201d songs are both macro and micro, within and without you, as a certain Beatle would say. Play Till You Win is a rich album with deep roots, a sophisticated art heart and a mature point of view about the masks (and complications) of desire.", "otherInfo": "*Craig Finn & The Uptown Controllers"}, {"Address": "982 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Pop Smoke", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9380266.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.410073, 37.782687], "Date": "Fri Nov 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-08", "Genre": "Genres: Hip Hop, Rap", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ski Mask The Slump God Presents \"The Stokeley Tour\" 2019"}, {"Address": "982 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "DJ Scheme", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.410073, 37.782687], "Date": "Fri Nov 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ski Mask The Slump God Presents \"The Stokeley Tour\" 2019"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Culture Abuse", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9115792.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Fri Nov 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-08", "Genre": "Genres: Having fun, Punk, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Slim's", "moreBioInfo": "Culture Abuse dare you to try categorizing them.

He formed his first band \u201cReggae National Tickets\u201d in 1992 and they quickly reached success selling more than 200,000 records. They were the first Italian band to play at Sunsplash and Sumfest in Jamaica in the Nineties. After their success in Italy, Alborosie moved to Jamaica in 2000. His friendship with John Baker (ex-producer of Pm Dawn and member of Island Records) was decisive: he began to work in Baker\u2019s Geejam studio in the Jamaican countryside and, little by little, he worked as a sound engineer and producer for international artists such as Wyclef, Angie Stone and Sisco. He also recorded Manu Chao and Nubians at the time of their visits on the island. Thanks to his talent as a producer, he managed the group Digicel Rising. After this experience, he labelled his first record Alborosie on his own label Forward Music in 2004. Despite some good tracks, most notably Burnin\u2019 and Lootin with Ky-mani Marley, he would have to wait until 2006 to reach international recognition with Herbalist which was considered best song of the year by David Rodigan. Alborosie becomes the first white artist to be distributed in Jamaica by Bob Marley\u2019s label, Tuff Gong. Above his work as a producer (e.i. XXL Riddim, with the voices of Gentleman, Sizzla, Luciano, Ky-mani Marley), he continues his own recordings (hits like \u201cKingston town\u201d, \u201cSlam bam\u201d, \u201cPolice\u201d) and featurings with: U-Roy on \u201cPrecious\u201d, Sizzla on \u201cMeditation\u201dand Gentleman on \u201cCelebration\u201d. His first solo album, \u201cSoul Pirate\u201d, was released in September 2008 under the Forward Recordings label. This first album was preceded by a limited edition distributed during the European tour. \u201cSoul Pirate\u201d voices the best reggae deejay in the world, David Rodigan, which samples his own track that made him famous in the world of reggae music. In 2009 Alborosie closed his own record label to begin working with Shang Yeng Clan studios, which launched the young artist I-eye with the single \u201cMama She Don\u2019t Like You\u201d. In 2009 Alborosie returned to Italy and Europe supported by \u201cShengen Clan Band\u201d to present his new album, \u201cEscape from Babylon\u201c, presenting 16 exclusive tracks featuring famous artists such as Dennis Brown and Gramps Morgan of Morgan Heritage. \u201cEscape from Babylon\u201d was released by the legendary label, Greensleeves Records, founded in London in 1975 by Chris Sedgwick and Chris Cracknell. It was later purchased in 2008 by VP Records, which produced artists like Shabba Ranks, Sizzla, Dennis Brown, Elephant Man and Vybz Kartel alongside historical reggae anthems such as Sean Paul\u2019s \u201cGet Busy\u201d, Shaggy\u2019s \u201cOh Carolina\u201d and Beenie Man\u2019s \u201cWho Am I\u201d. The first months of 2010 saw Alborosie engaged in a world tour that included dates in Mexico and California. Alongside his tour of the USA, Alborosie released the album \u201cEscape From Babylon To The Kingdom of Zion\u201d which unlike his previous album includes 18 tracks with new songs like: \u201cBoo Blue Movie\u201d and \u201cStepping Out\u201d featuring David Hines (frontman of Steel Pulse, the reggae band that won a Grammy Award in 1986). In July 2010, Alborosie released the album \u201cDub Clash\u201c. Albo himself plays on most of the tracks, drums, bass, keyboards, guitar and percussion, along some of the musicians from the shengen clan. \u201cDub clash\u201d is recorded and mixed at Shengen Studio kingston jamaica by Alborosie and is the first dub album from jamaica in a long time with that authentic roots spring reverb sound. Dedicated to King Tubby \u201cThe most incredible producer ever lived, the teacher\u201d, Albo offers the following information: \u201cThis album was entirely made in Kingston Jamaica with original organic vintage effects, Roland Space Echo, Fisher spring reverb, ak 9 spring reverb, Ak 47 spring reverb, Fairchild reverb, Multivox delasy, eli delay, MCI 2 tracks, Tascam 24 track.\u201d He also reveals \u201cReal dubwise should be the parmiggiano on a great plate of pasta\u2026 other than that!!!

Hailing out of Los Angeles, California, Arise Roots was formed in 2010, however, it seemed as though these brothers were eventually destined to cross paths. Each member had been performing in various reggae bands throughout Southern California and backing various reggae legends coming into town. However, drummer Ron Montoya decided to form what he considered to be the next powerhouse reggae band.\n\nAfter searching for several years and filtering through numerous musicians, Arise Roots was finally formed. Teaming up with heavy bassist Rudy Covarubias and keyboard/vocals specialist Todd Johnson, a tight rhythm section served as the driving foundation. Soon after, lead vocalist Karim Isreal was added providing his soulful, organic, and powerful voice. Finally, guitarist Robert Sotelo joined the group adding the finesse and authenticity needed for this original sound.\n\nThe goal: to create a fresh reggae sound with a modern feel that appeals to all ages and races, but one that doesn\u2019t compromise the true feel of roots reggae. Anybody who has had the opportunity to witness an Arise Roots show understands the powerful sound and positive vibration that they produce. Always paying homage to past reggae legends, Arise Roots\u2019 sound is influenced by such artists as The Heptones, Israel Vibration, The Wailing Souls, Black Uhuru, Dennis Brown, Gregory Isaacs, Mighty Diamonds, Alton Ellis, Barrington Levy, Burning Spear, Bob Marley and The Wailers, The Skatalites, Alton Ellis, Sizzla, and Midnite.

We were just writing songs with the instruments we had.\"\nThe result is a sound that the Portland, Maine-based band describes as \"holler folk,\" not\nbecause it involves a lot of hollering, per se, but because it invokes the rich communal\ntradition of field hollers, with their call-and-response melodies, sing-along hooks, and\ndensely layered harmonies. That sense of musical camaraderie is essential to everything\nThe Ghost of Paul Revere does, and nowhere is it more evident than their sophomore\nalbum, ''Monarch.'\nThe album builds on the success of the band's 2014 debut full-length, 'Believe,' and their\n2015 EP, 'Field Notes Vol. 1,' which was recorded primarily in a single day at Converse's\nRubber Tracks studio in Boston. The session was part of a prize package presented by the\niconic Newport Folk Festival, which had invited the band to perform at the storied Rhode\nIsland musical gathering earlier that year as part of a lineup featuring everyone from\nJames Taylor and Jason Isbell to The Lone Bellow and Bela Fleck.\n\"The Monday before Newport we got a message saying to pack our bags and come on\ndown,\" remembers Sherry. \"We hadn't played much outside of Maine or started opening for\nany big acts yet at that point, and it was a hugely inspiring moment.\"\nWord began to spread about the rowdy pickers from the north. The Boston Globe raved\nthat they \"create the type of music for which festivals are made,\" while No Depression said\nthey \"prove that superior roots music can come from anywhere,\" and Dispatch Magazine\nwrote that they possess not only \"the chops, but the heart to reach their audience and\nleave an undeniable impression.\" Hitting listeners straight in the feelings has been the\nband's M.O. since its inception in 2011, and they've used their powerful stage show to\nconvert the masses at every stop along their long and winding journey, which has included\nshared stages with artists like The Avett Brothers, The Travelin' McCourys, Brown Bird, The\nRevivalists, the Infamous Stringdusters, and more. The band sold out Port City Music Hall,\nStone Mountain Arts Center, and the Strand Theater multiple times, won Best In Maine at\nthe New England Music Awards, and capped off 2015 with an electrifying headline\nperformance on New Year's Eve at Portland's State Theatre in front of 1,600 enraptured\nfans.\nWhen it came time to record, 'Monarch,' though, the band knew they wanted to push the\nsonic envelope beyond the live-in-the-studio setup that had guided their previous efforts.\n\"Every other record has just been the three of us in a room with microphones until we got\na take we liked,\" explains Sherry. \"We approached this one differently. It was the first time\nwe did a lot of arranging and writing in the studio. We decided we'd worry about learning\nhow to present the songs live after we'd recorded everything instead of the other way\naround.\"\n\"It enabled us to get a lot more adventurous with our ideas,\" adds bassist/singer Sean\nMcCarthy. \"We wanted to do something new and explore where we could take the sound\nwhile still staying true to who we are.\"\nThe album opens with \"Little Bird,\" a playful, infectious foot-stomper that blends blues and\nsoul and roots and perfectly reflects the communal, inviting nature of the band's music.\n\nBanjo player Max Davis takes over the songwriting and lead vocal duties for \"Avalanche,\" an\nemotional anthem featuring one of the album's most lush arrangements along with driving\ndrums from special guest Tony McNaboe (Ray LaMontagne, Rustic Overtones), while \"King's\nRoad\" finds the band expanding their sonic palette to include strings and electric guitar,\nand \"Honey Please\" channels 60's R&B and Motown through old-school folk instrumentation.\n\nAt the core of everything The Ghost of Paul Revere does, though, are their powerful, stop-\nyou-dead-in-your-tracks harmonies. On songs like \"Wild Child,\" \"Welcome Home,\" and \"Need Somebody,\" the band conjures up whole worlds of shimmering sonic beauty in the blending\nof their voices. \"The album follows this arc where it starts very bright-eyed and optimistic and then hits a turning point where it gets really dark,\" says Sherry, \"like a relationship that starts\nbeautifully and then grows sour. As we started to build the record and expand the sound, it\nhad a place sonically and emotionally.\u201d\nBy the end of the record, the song cycle reveals that traveling through the darkness is in\nfact a necessary step for positive growth. 'Monarch' closer \"Chrysalides\" evokes the imagery\nof metamorphosis, a transformation that represents rebirth and new beginnings.\n\"It's about what happens in that moment of metamorphosis and change,\" says Davis. \"I was\ninterested in combining different words into a new term that could capture that feeling, so\n'Chrysalides' is a play on chrysalis. This was one of the first times that I allowed myself to\nbite into and really take advantage of that space in the writing.\"\nIf there's one takeaway from 'Monarch,' it's that change is inevitable. Lovers, families,\nfriends, instruments, sounds; they all transform with time. The key to thriving and\nsurviving in a challenging world is to embrace those transformations, to accept them not as\nendings but as fresh starts. What comes next? Only time can tell. One thing's for sure,\nthough: by opening their hearts and souls with such artistic grace and humility, The Ghost\nof Paul Revere have created a rich, rewarding, passionate community, one that they can\ncount on to join them for every step of the remarkable journey that lies ahead.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "374 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Lilan Kane", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7335896.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.885984, 37.330601], "Date": "Fri Nov 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-08", "Genre": "Genres: Rnb-soul, Jazz, R&b/soul, Soul, Pop", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Cafe Stritch", "moreBioInfo": "Lilan Kane (pronounced LEE - lawn) is an award winning singer-songwriter based in Oakland, CA.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "21+"}, {"Address": "161 Erie St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "The Architect", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6191498.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.419248, 37.768875], "Date": "Fri Nov 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-08", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Electronic, Hardcore, Metal, Techno, Metalcore", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Public Works", "moreBioInfo": "\"The Architect employs a fast-paced, relentless style of metalcore, relying heavily on breakdowns laced with melodic single-note riffs and raging screams.\" -Christian S.

Since then, they have been building their fan base in the best place possible: the Central Coast of California, or in fewer words, home. After making positive and memorable impressions on the local metal scene, with such acts as PORTRAITS, PARLEY, and BEARS AMONG MEN, The Architect has been seeking and playing shows in much further cities. In October of 2013, they traveled to Santa Ana to play alongside acts such as FALLSTAR, LION I AM, VICTORY HEIGHTS, and many others. In the following month of that same year, they were given the distinct honor of opening up for acts such as COLOSSUS, PHINEHAS, THOSE WHO FEAR, and WAR OF AGES in Bakersfield. In January of 2014, they met APOGEE in Visalia, playing their biggest headlining show to date. In March of 2014, on the eve of their first anniversary of the release of their debut EP \u201cThe Benevolent EP,\u201d The Architect was invited on a one week tour run with the local legend BEARS AMONG MEN. Visiting Fresno and Los Osos CA, Grants Pass and Springfield Oregon, and as far north as Everett and Seattle Washington, the Run Forest, Run Tour made its mark as the band\u2019s first successful tour ever. Since then, they have completed several short weekend runs that have extended out as far as Las Vegas, NV. The Architect then released their first ever music video for their new single \"Reprise\" on July 1st of 2014. In October, they announced a week long \"X-Wing VS Tie-Figh-Tour\" that took them to southern and central California and back during the first week of November. As God is first and foremost their pursuit of life, they aim to exemplify and glorify Him in their lives, shows, and music. It is only by the grace of Jesus that they have even made it this far, and this is their joy. Their passion for music and love for people is clearly evident in their endeavors. \"We thank God and each one of you for the support we have received. Without this, these efforts would be pointless. You are making our dreams come true, and for that we are increasingly humbled.\" -Brooks, Jimmy, Joseph, and Louie // THE ARCHITECT The Benevolent EP available on iTunes and Cdbaby.com now!

In between tours, Sweeney was working on the songs that would make up the album Peace Meal from an apartment overlooking the Pacific Ocean as well as Faraway Sound in Brooklyn, NY. The goal was to make this record quickly, before questions on the meaning of it all could reach him. Then, on a fateful night in April 2018, just as the final mixes for the album were being completed, an astrological grip intercepted Sweeney\u2019s life when he awoke to find his infant daughter no longer breathing and the toughest of life\u2019s questions falling all around him.\nA \u201cpillar of San Francisco's garage-psych community\u201d (TheBayBridged), Luke Sweeney has been a working musician for over a decade, playing with a wide variety of cohorts such as Tim Cohen (Fresh & Onlys), Tyson Vogel (Two Gallants), and Healing Potpourri. His personal output has always sparked interest among the interesting - an artist\u2019s artist, so to speak - as he \u201cconfounds aural expectations and puts the knock on reverence\u2026 with time-worn allusions to psychedelia, bubblegum, glam, and mellow Seventies balladry\u201d (Austin Chronicle) and \u201ca kaleidoscopic whoosh of psych-pop, indie-folk, lo-fi soul and futuristic blues\u201d (Bend Bulletin). Now, while those muses are still very present in his approach, the arrival of Peace Meal feels like something of a rebirth. Perhaps the songs were the fruit of a communicative collaboration between this plane of existence and another; Sweeney says the lyrics to \u2018Great Wide Ocean\u2019, written on the studio floor long before his daughter Rishi was conceived, came to him as if sent from another realm.\nMeanwhile, breezy melodies and buoyant beats soundtrack what is musically Sweeney\u2019s most pop-oriented album to date: \"It is easy to hear why this album has a healing quality for Sweeney; Peace Meal digs deep and balances a strong introspective slant with melodies reaching out for listeners and inviting them into its musical world. It deserves consideration as his finest work yet\" (Too Much Love).

Tambi\u00e9n durante ese a\u00f1o y bajo ese mismo sello, edita su primer disco junto a H\u00e9ctor Lavoe. La canci\u00f3n El Malo, del \u00e1lbum hom\u00f3nimo, se convierte en un \u00e9xito recordado hasta hoy. El d\u00fao adquiere gran reputaci\u00f3n en el circuito de clubes, sus temas contribuyen a que la m\u00fasica latina comience a sonar en las radios de Nueva York y a la difusi\u00f3n del sello Fania, con el que editan El busc\u00f3n (1968), Guisando (1969), Cosa nuestra (1970), Asalto navide\u00f1o (1971), La gran fuga (1971), El crimen paga (1972), El juicio (1972), Lo mato (1973) y El bueno, el malo y el feo (1975).

Sure, the pair met in Montreal in 2008. But as anyone who's been to Nevada's Black Rock Desert will tell you, Burning Man years are like dog years, and by that measure, Blond:ish has been together for a lifetime. As a youngster growing up in Canada, Vivie Ann aspired to be a computer hacker. Equally unique in her goals, Anstascia sought the acceptance of nerds. Both say they failed miserably. Eventually, their broken-heart trails converged and they created a midweek party in Montreal. Every Wednesday, they would promote, party, and DJ at the nightclub Cherry. These days, Viv and Anstascia are savy travelers. Their original productions and DJ sets are inspired, in part, by their travels and spiritual encounters. Tribal dudes chant and hum on the duo's new track, \u201cMoonbow.\u201d Dave Gahan, lead singer of Depeche Mode, provides the vocals in Blond:ish's remix of the legendary English band's \u201cShould Be Higher.\u201d Plus, they're driven to share their passion with the world, one listener at a time. \u201cA lot of people have never heard of us. Some people don\u2019t take us seriously,\" Anstascia says. \"We\u2019re doing our best to show that our music speaks for itself.\u201d In 2015 they released their album \u2018Welcome to the Present\u2019 on Kompakt Records. The LPs journey of field recordings, traditional instruments and polyglot vocals results in a masterfully crafted, intoxicating soundscape unlike any other debut album out there. It only served to further their musical journey. 2017 sees remixes for DJ Sabo, a Modular Project remix of their classic Wizard of Love, \u2018Moonbow\u2019 on Monkey Safari\u2019s Homage label, as well as more new original music to come throughout the year. It is also the year they launch ABRACADABRA, their own event series and label which had its test run in Tulum January 2017 and will spend the season leaving its mark on Scorpios, Mykonos for 6 weeks of the summer.

On a personal note\u2026 Writing, composing, performing and recording has been an ongoing thread at the core of Jessica Leia\u2019s life. She has obtained a degree in the stuff and has even taught it, but more importantly, Jessica lives it. Being a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist, Jessica has also stepped in to accompany other artists in their performances, and studio projects. She has even released two New Age piano albums, \u201cBaby Tears\u201d and \u201cDissention\u201d which are a compilation of piano compositions she composed as a child and teenager. Having always been an active musician, Jessica has been performing for the public since childhood. Beginning at recitals and then on to larger venues, including the Concord Pavilion, Jessica has performed in nearly every musical scene one might imagine - even as an accompanist in musical theatre. Whether in a bus, in the corners of cafes and smelly bars, or in restaurants and lounges, where she has been hired to play the likes of Sinatra and other classic crooners, or even just hosting open mics where the crowds are often more interested in the dart games they play than they are in the artists on the stage, Jessica Leia is no stranger to the triumphs and disappointments of a musician\u2019s life. In conclusion\u2026 So, with good humor and ongoing curiosity, Jessica Leia continues to be fascinated by the idiosyncrasies and surprise turns that appear on the path of a musician. And with the onslaught of so many do-it-yourself options for music makers, Jessica Leia has begun a campaign to create an online presence as a springboard for her original act. With dogged determination, she works tirelessly to cultivate a platform large and versatile enough to make it possible to share her music with the whole world.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "581 5th St, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "foolie", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9391176.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.278385, 37.799161], "Date": "Sat Nov 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-09", "Genre": "Genres: Tech House, House, Booty Tech, Foolhouse, Techno, Future House, Deep Tech", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "BRIX 581", "moreBioInfo": "Hailing from a dimension of sounds beyond the comprehension of human ears, FOOLiE blesses us with otherworldly beats and drops.", "otherInfo": "***Friends!!!

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

She exemplifies everything that a hard-working, goal driven musician should strive for. Musically trained in Colaiste Stiof\u00e1n Naoifa, Cork, Ballyfermot College of Further Education, Dublin and University College Cork (some of Ireland's most prestigious centres for music education). Not only is her natural talent very apparent but the years of hard work and study also shine through in her captivating performances.

With the slanted multisyllabic rhyme scheme of early Eminem fused with the clean flow of renegade Christian rapper Lecrae, hip hop heads deem Topher a hybrid artist. Blending the gritty sound from the boombap era with the unconventional style of today\u2019s trip-hop gives way to Topher\u2019s competitive edge and ability to cultivate the essence of authenticity- a key ingredient missing from mainstream rap.\n\nRealizing his passion for music at the tender age of five, Topher tiptoed his way into the music scene with a guitar in one hand and a toy in the other. It took all but three years for Topher to realize that following in his father\u2019s footsteps of blues singing and guitar slinging wasn\u2019t a hereditary gift passed from generation to generation. Taking his very first step against the grain, a young Topher tossed the guitar picks and picked up a pen. In discovering the natural ability to write his own lyrics, Topher soon captured the stylistic elements rooted in every true emcee. From style, structure, speed and accuracy to originality, fluid flow and seamless delivery!\n\nWhat started as a childhood pastime blossomed into a fully developed skill. From unpaid gigs at high school house parties to sharing college stages with Jared Pellerin, Topher set out to prove he deserved to sit amongst the greats in the rap game. But with time comes change. For Topher, life turned on its head and veered down a tumultuous road of heartbreak and hardships, while Jared Pellerin went on to become the New Orleans Rapper and Indie sensation known as Pell . Battling self -doubt and a lack of direction, Topher enlisted in the Air Force with the intent to find a more fulfilling purpose. Although estranged, his relationship with music never met its full end. Assembling stanzas in his head and freestyling has always been an innate ability and although Topher shied away from his gift, he found inspiration in the oddest measures. Rapping in Hebrew for an audience of 5 thousand people was one them.\n\nUpon discharge, the hobbyist pursued his passion and became a successful rapper. Topher co-founded the indie record label Be Inspired Group in Memphis, Tennessee - where he now resides and released his first full length project entitled Everybody Hates Chris on April 25th 2017-denoting the 6th anniversary from the military and equally symbolizing the moment he chose his dreams over conformity. Determined not to be boxed into the gospel rap genre, the successful entrepreneur transitioned from a strictly faith based artist to a progressive rapper- one in pursuit to bridge the gap between Christian rappers and traditional artists. With uplifting anecdotes and the aggressive surge of thought provoking messages, Topher\u2019s creative range commands attention, which is a telling indicator of true lyrical ability. His walk-in life is a proof that regardless of the hand you are dealt-how you play the game that makes you successful.\n\n\u201cA man\u2019s gift makes room for him and brings him before great men\u201d.

At one point, fire fighters were in Grimmett\u2019s backyard stopping the wild fire from encroaching onto the property, while the band was inside demoing and writing. \u201cThey blocked off all the streets and we had to sneak into my place through this apartment structure,\u201d Grimmett recalls. \u201cThankfully my house is still standing and the hills are a bright green.\u201d\n\nIn working with de la Garza, HUNNY spent weeks in the studio and embraced their experimental side more fully than ever before. \u201cThere was a lot of rabbit-holing and taking our time to find different sounds, especially with the keyboard parts and the synths,\u201d says Yarger, naming classic synth-pop bands like Depeche Mode among HUNNY\u2019s main inspirations.\n\nWith its fantastically unpredictable sonic palette, Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. opens on \u201cLula I\u2019m Not Mad\u201d\u2014a bouncy pop track that matches its shimmery synth lines with hopelessly crushed-out lyrics. \u201cIt\u2019s about when you\u2019re infatuated with someone, so you just let them do whatever they want to you,\u201d says Yarger. On \u201cSaturday Night,\u201d HUNNY slip into a more melancholy but still-romantic mood, embedding their storytelling with references to My So-Called Life and Echo & the Bunnymen. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about being emo in your bedroom on a weekend night, but being able to share that with somebody else,\u201d says Grimmett. And on the sweetly self-effacing \u201cHalloween,\u201d Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. closes out by drawing some strangely affecting poetry from the mundane experience of paying a parking ticket online. \u201cI was sitting on the floor in my apartment and working on this demo, and I decided to be super-literal about what was happening in the moment,\u201d says Yarger. \u201cIt all goes back to trying to be more vulnerable on this album, and just putting whatever we\u2019re feeling right into the lyrics.\u201d\n\nFormed in 2014, HUNNY came up at the same time as various contemporary musicians, skaters, video directors, and other creatives from the same neighborhood. \u201cThere was a house in the Valley that we used to go to parties at, and we all ended up meeting there and eventually playing together,\u201d says Grimmett. After playing their first gig in a garage, HUNNY delivered their debut single \u201cCry for Me\u201d in January 2015, then self-released the Windows I EP in May 2017. Soon after signing to Epitaph, HUNNY put out their 2018 sophomore EP Windows II, and quickly got to work on their first full-length.\n\nAs they immersed themselves in writing for Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes., HUNNY purposely strayed from their punk roots (\u201cI definitely went through a phrase of being a weird little crust-punk kid,\u201d Yarger points out), and dug deeper into their love for \u201980s new wave and \u201990s pop. In that process, the band ultimately instilled a whole new sense of immediacy into their music. \u201cWe started to be less ethereal and cryptic, and focused on writing songs that people could really latch onto,\u201d says Grimmett.\n\nAnother key aspect of HUNNY\u2019s newly revitalized sound: the hugely catchy choruses found in each song on Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. As Grimmett explains, the band introduced that element with their ever-communal live show in mind. \u201cWe really love the emotive aspect of playing a show,\u201d says Grimmett. \u201cThe kids are always moshing and stage-diving and crowd-surfing, but they\u2019re also singing our songs back to us the whole time. For this record we really took the time to think about what we were going to give them to sing, and made sure that it\u2019s something with real feeling and meaning to it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "333 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "The Menzingers", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9193602.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Sat Nov 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-09", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Indie, Rock, Alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Slim's", "moreBioInfo": "The Menzingers\u2019 new album \u2018Hello Exile' is out now on Epitaph Records. Purchase and stream at https://themenzingers.ffm.to/helloexile.\n\nSince forming as teenagers in 2006, The Menzingers have shown their strength as rough-and-tumble storytellers, turning out songs equally rooted in frenetic energy and lifelike detail. On their new album Hello Exile, the Philadelphia-based punk band take their lyrical narrative to a whole new level and share their reflections on moments from the past and present: high-school hellraising, troubled relationships, aging and alcohol and political ennui. And while their songs often reveal certain painful truths, Hello Exile ultimately maintains the irrepressible spirit that\u2019s always defined the band.\n\nThe sixth full-length from The Menzingers, Hello Exile arrives as the follow-up to After the Party: a 2017 release that landed on best-of-the-year lists from outlets like Clash and Noisey, with Stereogum praising its \u201calmost unfairly well-written punk songs.\u201d In creating the album, the band again joined forces with producer Will Yip (Mannequin Pussy, Quicksand), spending six weeks recording at Yip\u2019s Conshohocken, PA-based Studio 4. \u201cThat\u2019s the longest amount of time we\u2019ve ever worked with Will,\u201d notes Barnett. \u201cWe wanted to make sure these stories didn\u2019t get lost in the music, so we kept it to a lot of room sounds with the guitar and bass and drums.\u201d\n\nDespite that subtler sonic approach, Hello Exile still rushes forward with a restless urgency\u2014an element in full force on the album-opening \u201cAmerica (You\u2019re Freaking Me Out).\u201d With its pounding rhythms and furious guitar riffs, the viscerally charged track provides a much-needed release for all those feeling frenzied by the current political climate. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a pretty insane time, where all you can think about every single day is \u2018What the hell is going on with this country?\u2019\u201d says Barnett. \u201cBut as I was writing that song I realized that it\u2019s kind of always freaked me out, especially coming-of-age during the Iraq War. I love so much about America, but I think you can\u2019t deny that there are some people in power who are absolutely evil.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on Hello Exile, The Menzingers turn their incisive songwriting to matters of love and romance, exploring the glories and failures of human connection. A wistful piece of jangle-pop, \u201cAnna\u201d paints a portrait of lovesick longing, complete with dreamy recollections of wine-drunk kitchen dancing. And on \u201cStrangers Forever,\u201d the band shifts gears for a searing tribute to parting ways, backing their spiky guitars with brilliantly barbed lyrics (e.g., \u201cMaybe it\u2019s for the better if we both stay strangers forever\u201d).\n\nAn album fascinated with home and displacement and belonging (or the lack thereof), Hello Exile takes its title from its heavy-hearted centerpiece. With its aching vocals, graceful acoustic guitar work, and beautifully lilting melody, \u201cHello Exile\u201d draws inspiration from Anton Chekhov\u2019s \u201cThe Lady with the Dog\u201d (a short story set in the Black Sea resort city of Yalta). \u201cI grew up in a tiny town that\u2019s essentially a cross between a summer-vacation spot for New Yorkers and a retirement home, so for most of my childhood there were always people coming in and out of my life,\u201d says Barnett, who hails from Lake Ariel, PA. \u201cReading that story made me think of how isolating it felt when my friends would leave to go back to the city at the end of the season, and I\u2019d still just be stuck way out there in the woods.\u201d\n\nIn looking back on the songwriting process behind Hello Exile, Barnett points to the starkly confessional \u201cI Can\u2019t Stop Drinking\u201d to illustrate the band\u2019s commitment to total candor. \u201cWe\u2019ve written so many songs about fun times with alcohol\u2014but the older you get, it\u2019s not always fun anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cWith \u2018I Can\u2019t Stop Drinking,\u2019 I wanted to be completely truthful and get away from glorifying anything. Sometimes it\u2019s tough to look at yourself and at others that way, but it felt important to make it as real as possible.\u201d\n\nWith the band achieving that soul-baring intimacy all throughout the album, Hello Exile emerges as The Menzingers\u2019 most emotionally daring work to date. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been in love with good songwriting and the beauty of taking a song to its fullest potential, but with this album I feel like we\u2019re really becoming the band we\u2019ve always wanted to be,\u201d says Barnett. Not only a creative turning point for The Menzingers, that uncompromising honesty helps fulfill their mission of leaving each listener with a potent sense of solidarity. \u201cA lot of these songs are looking at different life challenges\u2014they\u2019re stories of people at some sort of crossroads,\u201d Barnett says. \u201cWe might not have the answers for anybody, but hopefully the songs will help them to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and know that they\u2019re not alone in whatever tough decisions they\u2019re facing.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "22222 Redwood Rd., Castro Valley, CA 94546", "Artist": "Next To Normal", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.073268, 37.685074], "Date": "Sat Nov 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Smalltown Society", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "476 1st St E, Sonoma, CA 95476", "Artist": "LOLO", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9076346.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.456434, 38.292238], "Date": "Sat Nov 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-09", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter, Pop, Alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Sebastiani Theatre", "moreBioInfo": "From Jackson, TN, LOLO is a show-stopping singer who has \"so much music flowing through [her] that it fills two people\" (Associated Press).

She has garnered ten #1 radio hits, six Top 5 solo records and two #1 spots on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz album chart. In 2014, Mindi received her first GRAMMY\u00ae nomination in the Best Pop Instrumental Album category, followed by a 2015 GRAMMY\u00ae nomination for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album for her solo LP Wild Heart featuring Gregg Allman, Joe Perry, Trombone Shorty, Booker T. Jones, Keb\u2019 Mo\u2019, and Max Weinberg.\n\nThe daughter and granddaughter of working musicians, Abair continues to captivate fans while evolving her sound. In 2014, after two seasons as the featured saxophonist on the hit series American Idol, Abair released Wild Heart. This LP showcased a compilation of grittier rock and soul tracks featuring some of the biggest names in music. To help translate this sound to her live shows, Mindi enlisted longtime friend and The Boneshakers founder Randy Jacobs (Bonnie Raitt, Was Not Was, Willie Nelson) to inject his brand of Detroit Blues Rock. The collaboration was undeniable, and it lead to an almost immediate decision to join forces creatively. Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers features band leader Mindi Abair (Saxophone, Vocals), Randy Jacobs (Guitar, Vocals), Sweet Pea Atkinson (Vocals), Rodney Lee (Keys), Derek Frank (Bass, Vocals), and Third Richardson (Drums, Vocals).

The EastWest Sessions was recorded over five days at legendary Hollywood recording studio EastWest Studios with renowned Blues Rock producer Kevin Shirley (Led Zepplin, Joe Bonamassa, The Black Crowes, Aerosmith). The album, which will be released September 15, 2017, is a powerful, bluesy, momentous, and deeply emotional journey. The album features a track with iconic blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa, and 2017 GRAMMY\u00ae winner in the Best Contemporary Blues Album category, Fantastic Negrito. It debuted #3 on the Billboard Blues Album Chart, hit #1 on the RMR Blues Rock Album Chart and won Best Blues Song - Fan Award for \"Pretty Good For A Girl\" at the 2018 Independent Music Awards.\n\nWhen she\u2019s not touring as Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers, the top Berklee graduate can often be found recording and/or touring with a wide array of legendary peers: Joe Perry, Trombone Shorty, Smokey Robinson, Booker T.

After three decades, in a time when the globe grows smaller and more connected by the day, and sounds from all over that globe can be found in almost any piece of contemporary music, it appears that the world may finally be catching up with Hiroshima. The band offers a retrospective of those early years with the August 18, 2009, release of Legacy (HUCD 3153) on Heads Up International, a division of Concord Music Group. The album features eleven songs from the first ten years of Hiroshima\u2019s prolific history \u2013 each re-recorded by the band\u2019s current six-member lineup with assistance from four guest artists. At the heart of Legacy \u2013 and of the Hiroshima experience in general \u2013 is the convergence of Eastern and Western music, as forged by saxophonist Dan Kuramoto and koto player June Kuramoto, the founding members whose joint commitment to genre bending and cross-cultural innovation is as solid today as it was on that first recording. \u201cWhen you start looking back at fifteen records over thirty years, that\u2019s a lot of material to choose from,\u201d says Dan Kuramoto. \u201cSo we narrowed the scope to the first ten years, which includes five records \u2013 two of which were gold. We tracked everything live in my home studio for this new recording, with almost no overdubs. In many cases, the songs on this record are fairly similar to the originals. In some cases, they\u2019re very different.\u201d Rounding out the current Hiroshima lineup on Legacy are keyboardist Kimo Cornwell, bassist Dean Cortez, drummer Danny Yamamoto and taiko/percussionist Shoji Kameda. Guest artists \u2013 whom Kuramoto refers to as the band\u2019s \u201cextended family\u201d \u2013 include percussionist Richie Gajate Garcia and vocalists Terry Steele, Yvette Nii and Jim Gilstrap. Despite its retrospective sensibilities, Legacy is by no means a swan song for Hiroshima. Rather, it\u2019s bookend to thirty years of innovative music, and a promise of more great things to come. \u201cI would like to think that there\u2019s a heart and a voice within this music that doesn\u2019t go out of style,\u201d says Kuramoto. \u201cThese songs are as fresh and meaningful to us today as they were the first time they were recorded. They\u2019re not of a particular genre. They are our musical heart. They shift gears from Japanese to jazz to salsa to R&B and beyond. Throughout each piece, you can hear the echoes of all the experiences that have influenced us along the way.\u201d New CD \"J-Town Beat\"!

Yet there at the crossing of two old American railroad lines, CLOAK were conceived in the year 2013. Their debut full-length, 'To Venomous Depths' is simply a perfect amalgamation of Nordic black metal with catchy hooks and melodic rock. And while the Americans are not claiming to be reinventing the wheel, their outstanding song-writing is catapulting this album to the top. CLOAK have named DISSECTION, DEEP PURPLE, and FIELDS OF THE NEPHILIM as main influences, but their harsh yet groove-fuelled sound has invited critics to draw comparisons with such acts as TRIBULATION, WATAIN, and YOUNG AND IN THE WAY. After spending two years in the rehearsal room carefully preparing their material, CLOAK released a first sign of life in the shape of 'Demo 2015', which created an audible buzz in the US underground. A two-track, self-titled EP followed in 2016, gaining the Americans worldwide attention and critical acclaim. In their short time of existence, CLOAK have already shared stages with renowned acts such as WOLVES IN THE THRONE ROOM, WINDHAND, INTER ARMA, SATAN, and TAAKE. It will not take CLOAK long to capture your interest, but with each new spin 'To Venomous Depths' will reveal new details that make their discovery worthwhile.

Balfori quit shortly after due to musical divergence. In early '99 the band found Archaon whose speed and technique took their music to a new level of intensity and brutality.\n\nCome spring 2000, 1349 decided to record a new promo showcasing the new material, and Frost of Satyricon was asked to lay down the drum tracks to get the speed required. Holycaust Records offered them a deal and released the new promo as an eponymous MCD. By early 2001, the band felt they had enough killer songs for afull-length album \u2013 \u201cLiberation\u201d. Hearing this material, Frost was so impressed that he asked to join and became a permanent member of the band. Recorded and mixed at Gordon Studios, Liberation blended old school soundscapes with warp-speed hysteria. 1349 signed with Candlelight Records in 2003 and released their debut full-length album in april 2003, then marched unstoppably forwards with the following releases \u201cBeyond the Apocalypse\u201d in 2004 and \u201cHellfire\u201d in 2005.\n\nIn between recordings 1349 spent a lot of time on the road and have over the years toured with Celtic Frost, Gorgoroth and Carcass, to name a few, as well as performing at festivals like Wacken, Summer Breeze, Hellfest and SXSW. Guitarist and founding member Tjalve left in 2006 to focus his musical efforts on his band Pantheon I. Four years after the release of \u201cHellfire\u201d, 1349 decided to unleash a quite different monster upon the unsuspecting masses and \u201cRevelations of the Black Flame\u201d saw 1349 return to Studio Studio Nyhagen with Tom G. Warrior co-mixing the album along with Ravn. Released May 25th 2009 on Candlelight Records, Revelations... saw 1349 explore the slower, darker and more ambient side of black metal, while still retaining the spirit of aural hellfire. An even deeper darkness was added to the sphere of 1349...it became evident that from here, it was gonna get scary.\n\n2010 was a year when 1349 really started to flex muscles. With new cooperation partner Indie Recordings as the chosen label, 1349 unleashed their latest aural assault DEMONOIR, filled to the brim with abyssic darkness and hellish energy. This release - by far their most brutal to this date - showed that the band had gotten capable at blending a deeper and more sinister darkness with extreme intensity and venomous aggression, another proof of the band\u2019s innovative take on Black Metal.\n\nThe year also saw 1349 playing some one-off European shows, coming to Finland for the first time, as well as touring the US with Cannibal Corpse and later co-headlining with Triptykon. Several high-profile festivals such as Wacken and Summer Breeze were once again given a lethal dose of Hellfire.\n\n2011 started with a showcase at By:Larm and followed with festival appearances at Hellfest, Roskilde, Party-San, Brutal Assault and Bloodstock. The year was topped of with an infernal concert at Oslo\u2019s big rock stage, Rockefeller, and a UK and Ireland tour.\n\n2012 brings 1349 to places dark and strange; be warned, and be ready...", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2020 Addison St, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "The Gina Furtado Project", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9293016.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Sat Nov 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Berkeley, CA: The Freight and Salvage Coffeehouse, 2020 Addison Street\nTickets $32 adv / $36 door. 510-644-2020 for info."}, {"Address": "201 Washington St, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Seven Days Straight", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.643119, 38.23494], "Date": "Sat Nov 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Phoenix Theater", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "LoFi Satellites | 6 Speed Supernova | Seven Days Straight"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Beautiful Dudes", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7016783.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420383, 37.769717], "Date": "Sat Nov 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-09", "Genre": "Genres: Rad Rock, Garage Rock, Rock, Roll, Surf Rock, Post Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brick & Mortar Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "The Dudes are Tom Bevitori, Robbie Landsburg, Art Echternacht, and Jonah Wells, born and raised champions of Nevada City, California.

And interviews with Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Bonnie Raitt, Jimmie Vaughan and Buddy Guy put the band in perspective. The 3- piece set will be available in a variety of formats \u2013 2 LPs + Mp3, 2 CDs + DVD, Blu-Ray + 2 CDs and digitally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up in the Northwest, Robert Cray listened to the gospel of the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, Bobby Bland\u2019s soul, Jimi Hendrix\u2019s rock guitar and the Beatles pop sounds. He would bring all of the influences into play throughout his career, but his teenage band was captivated by Southern Soul and the blues. \u201cIn the early days of the band we were getting back into O.V. Wright and paying attention to my favorite blues players; Buddy Guy, Otis Rush, Albert King and especially Albert Collins,\u201d Cray says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Texas-born blues guitarist known as Master of the Telecaster, Albert Collins, sealed the deal on the Cray Band\u2019s early direction. The musical highlight of Cray\u2019s senior year was his class voting to bring Collins in to play a graduation party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe glow of a career in music began when Cray was a teen, and in 1974 it burst into flames as the Robert Cray Band came together in Eugene, Oregon. How strong was the fire? \u201cRichard and I didn\u2019t own a vehicle, and we were staying with his girlfriend in Eugene. We hitched a ride to Salem, where our drummer Tom Murphy was going to school, to rehearse,\u201d\n\n\n\nCray recalls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the group\u2019s 1980 debut release, Who\u2019s Been Talkin\u2019, word about the Cray Band began to spread across the Northwest and down in to California. Playing packed bars and roadhouses the Cray Band was thrilling. Yes, fans could hear an Albert Collins guitar riff and a Howlin\u2019 Wolf song but the sound was present. Blues and soul fans showed up religiously, but those steamy raucous sets also drew crowds whose tastes in music ranged from rock to funk and jazz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso among the Cray Band admirers were other musicians. John Lee Hooker put his appreciation into action. \u201cThe first time we played with Hooker was in Montana. We were opening the set and he was playing solo,\u201d Cray recalls. \u201cWe\u2019d never met him before but he just walked on stage and started playing with us. We dug the hell out of the guy, and after that we were friends.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cray Band\u2019s next two releases \u2013 Bad Influence and False Accusations \u2013 charted, taking the four-piece\u2019s sound across the airways and abroad. The group was on a roll, but the players slept on couches. \u201cWe were just road rats,\u201d Cray says with a chuckle. \u201cWe\u2019d take a break for two weeks to record, then go back out. We didn\u2019t have a house, a home, any of those responsibilities.\u201d On one of those breaks Cray went into the studio with Collins and another great Texas guitarist and singer, Johnny Clyde Copeland, to record Showdown!, a CD that has become essential to any 80s electric blues collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the sounds of the blues and soul that first drew attention from artists in the rock arena. In an interview on the DVD included in 4 Nights of 40 Years Live, Eric Clapton gives his initial response to Robert Cray saying, \u201cAs a blues fan, we\u2019re saved.\u201d The Cray Band\u2019s beginnings did bring the sounds of its mentors into the mainstream, even taking the music of John Lee Hooker, Etta James and Albert Collins to a larger, younger audience. But no one knew how broad the band\u2019s audience would be until the Cray Band opened the ears of rock radio programmers. With the 1986 release of Strong Persuader the Cray Band\u2019s tunes were put in heavy rotation on mega rock stations across the nation. The first hit, \u201cSmoking Gun,\u201d was followed by \u201cI Guess I Showed Her\u201d and \u201cRight Next Door (Because of Me).\u201d The Cray Band\u2019s next two releases, Don\u2019t Be Afraid of the Dark and Midnight Stroll, brought more radio listeners to record stores, increasing sales of the group\u2019s CDs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the path of fame taken by blues-based rockers like Johnny Winter and Stevie Ray Vaughan, Cray became a sensation, leading his band in concerts at large arena and rock festival. He was the first African American artist since Jimi Hendrix to rise to such fame in rock music. Was there a change in the band\u2019s direction or had the blues arrived again into the mainstream after more than three decades of being forgotten by radio? \u201cWe were doing blues and Rand B from the first,\u201d Crays says. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of what we do. If you\u2019re writing a tune it\u2019s only natural to grab something from someplace else. You\u2019re gonna put in some soul changes and some jazz, something you\u2019ve been listening to. With what we do there\u2019s a whole lot of room to move.\u201d\n\n\n\nClapton\u2019s admiration for Cray led to a writing collaboration on the hit \u201cOld Love,\u201d which featured Cray on guitar. A call came from Rolling Stone guitarist Keith Richard who asked him to be in the film he and Steve Jordan were producing about the rock guitarist Chuck Berry, \u201cHail! Hail! Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\u201d Concert footage in the film features Richards, Jordan, Clapton, Julian Lennon, Linda Ronstadt and Etta James. Cray performs \u201cBrown Eyed Handsome Man\u201d with Berry. Dressed in a baby blue tuxedo jacket, the young guitarist is the epitome of the tune\u2019s title. Cray also performed on the Tina Turner TV special \u201cBreak Every Rule.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the 90s the Cray Band was featured in concert with artists like Clapton, the Stones, John Lee Hooker, BB King and Bonnie Raitt, who on the DVD declares the band leader is \u201can original; he\u2019s passionate, he\u2019s a bad ass and puts on one of the best shows you\u2019ll ever see.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmidst these accolades, soaring record sales and a packed touring schedule the Cray Band recorded six CDs in the 90s. Cray produced Shame + A Sin, which referenced his blues roots, in 1993. It was followed by two more self-produced recordings, Some Rainy Morning and Sweet Potato Pie. Recorded in Memphis and featuring the famed Memphis Horns Sweet Potato Pie was the Cray Band\u2019s most soulful album to date. The next recording Take Off Your Shoes delved even deeper into Memphis sounds of the 60s. \u201cThat was definitely a soul record,\u201d Cray says. \u201cI\u2019d already been writing songs, Jim (Pugh, who was keyboards with the Cray Band from 1989 to 2014) was writing songs, leaning toward soul. Steve (Jordan, producer) heard them and put the icing on the cake.\u201d Jordan, who subsequently produced the Cray Band\u2019s In My Soul, Shoulda Been Home and the first CD in 4 Nights of 40 Years Live, also brought the personification of Memphis soul to the recording session, Willie Mitchell, to help with arrangements for the Memphis Horns. Mitchell discovered and first recorded Al Green along with other Southern Soul singers like Ann Peebles, O.V. Wright and Syl Johnson for the famed Memphis label Hi Records. When he arrived at the Cray recording session, he brought not only the Memphis presence but also a present. \u201cWillie came over \u2013 he was wearing a gold jacket \u2013 and gave me this song, \u2018Love Gone to Waste,\u2019\u201d Cray says. \u201cThen we put some final touches on the CD at his studio in Memphis. It was a great opportunity to see Willie in the studio.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth on Take Your Shoes Off and 4 Nights of 40 Years Live, \u201cLove Gone to Waste\u201d showcases Robert Cray\u2019s natural ease with soul ballads. He is intense but smooth in telling the story of love gone bad. Then in a falsetto voice he soars through the sadness into the inevitable pain. It is a song that Cray owns because no other singer has dared try to do it justice. Take Your Shoes Off won a Grammy in 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next decade the Cray Band recorded seven CDs, three of them live, and two \u2013 Twenty and This Time \u2013 were nominated for Grammys. The group\u2019s most recent recordings, Nothing But Love and In My Soul put the band back on the Billboard Charts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multimedia 4 Nights of 40 Years Live is a testament to the band\u2019s longevity and vitality. The 80s concert footage is exuberant and shows the charisma of Young Bob (a reference in song that Cray makes to himself in homage to Muddy Waters calling himself Young Muddy) as a guitarist, vocalist and band leader. The live performances at recent concerts capture seasoned musicians bringing a vivid, illustrative past into the moment. Cray\u2019s Stratocaster solos sing, cry and take on the funk. His voice has grown richer and wiser yet remains sweet.\n\n\n\nit is extraordinary for musicians to thrive over four decades, and the Robert Cray Band is just that, an extraordinary story of success. On the DVD Texas blues and R&B artist Jimmie Vaughan sums up Robert Cray\u2019s singularity and success simply when he says, \u201cHe\u2019s got one foot in the future and one foot in the old stuff.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "Oakland, CA", "Artist": "Biblioteka", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8613420.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2714, 37.8045], "Date": "Sat Nov 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-09", "Genre": "Genres: Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Swamp", "moreBioInfo": "Seattle rock and roll with new wave and goth influences!

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "21+"}, {"Address": "1214 Apollo Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94085", "Artist": "Halamay Entertainment", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9491463.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.994914, 37.378528], "Date": "Sat Nov 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-09", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Quarter Note Bar & Grill", "moreBioInfo": "Halamay Entertainment LLC\nEntertainment Booking Agent: Let Halamay Entertainment help you find the talent for your next event, festival, club, private party & corporate event!\nwww.halamayentertainment.com", "otherInfo": "SAVE THE DATE!

Play Till You Win, the much anticipated first full-length album by New York songwriter and visual artist Cassandra Jenkins, is coming out April 7 (on Cassandra Complex).\n\n\n\nPlay Till You Win is both an elaboration on and a departure from Cassandra\u2019s previous work, which includes an acclaimed, self-released EP in 2013, singles \u201cRabbit\u201d and \u201cWild World\u201d (a Cat Stevens cover that was prominently featured on the trailer for HBO\u2019s The Returned), and the lusciously orchestrated \u201cPerfect Day\u201d (especially written for Philadelphia\u2019s celebrated Weathervane Music documentary web series Shaking Through).\n\n\n\nHer new songs, described as \"a beautiful blend of smoke and delicacy,\" showcase Cassandra's roots while disarming the listener with lush arrangements and \"warm and woozy guitar\" (Consequence of Sound). Catchy aural ghosts that recall George Harrison\u2019s Dylan-obsessed All Things Must Pass haunt the record's melodies as a constant stylistic lodestar, as cited by co-producer Sam Owens (aka Sam Evian). Woven throughout are nods to Lee Hazlewood\u2019s Hollywood-and-Vine country surrealism as well as Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch\u2019s work for Julee Cruise, resulting in a tapestry that is \"tender and trance like\" (Interview Magazine), both sinister and sincere.\n\n\n\nIt was the Nudie-besuited Gram Parsons, one of several patron saints lovingly looking over and bestowing their grace over Play Till You Win, who famously declared when asked if he played \u201ccountry rock,\u201d that he preferred to call what he played \"cosmic American music\". What makes Cassandra\u2019s new collection stand out from fellow acolytes of psychedelic burritos and dusty journeys through gilded palaces of sin, is that her vision and scope of influences are broad, idiosyncratic and ever-changing. Not to speak of her unique background\u2014she grew up in Manhattan, in a family of jazz musicians. Much like Parsons, Cassandra uses the clarity and smoldering sense of longing conveyed by her \"smokey vocals\" (NPR) to transcend her urban surroundings in order to connect to a deeper, quintessentially American vein of expression.\n\n\n\nAll these aspects and interests coalesce in a truly multilayered album. Her personal, matured exploration of shifting desire, the roles between lovers, and an uneasy sense of narcissism made explicit by Cassandra\u2019s DIY music videos (she handcrafts most of her own art, costumes and videos herself), is also influenced by visual and performance artists like Marcel Dzama, Mike Kelley and Chris Burden, renowned figures of contemporary art who also retain (sometimes tragically) an aura of folk or outsider art. This is not trivial for the aims of Cassandra\u2019s album, a deceptive piece of pop that hides a pretty serious, committed art/occult meditation on self, desire and, yes, ch-ch-ch-changes.\n\n\n\nThe cosmos in Cassandra\u2019s self proclaimed \u201cCosmic American\u201d songs are both macro and micro, within and without you, as a certain Beatle would say. Play Till You Win is a rich album with deep roots, a sophisticated art heart and a mature point of view about the masks (and complications) of desire.", "otherInfo": "Craig Finn & The Uptown Controllers"}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Scott Ruth", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8883043.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Sat Nov 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-09", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Singer, Songwriter, Indie", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Independent", "moreBioInfo": "Scott Ruth is an American singer-songwriter from Los Angeles, CA.

If intergalactic energy beings, upon their initiation into an order of whirling dervishes, built a pan-dimensional booty-shaking engine powered by psychedelic math...it would sound like a cut-rate CTS cover band. With their blend of progressive rock and improvisatory jazz, soaked in Indian and Middle Eastern styles, CTS blends disparate elements into an utterly original whole. A relentless touring schedule has earned them a fervent following around the world, with fans ranging from jam-band hippies to corpse-painted headbangers.\n\nTheir latest album, You Are Literally a Metaphor, is the culmination of a fifteen-year musical journey. Packed with the same fury and dazzling virtuosity of their previous work, Metaphor is also a portrait of three musicians reaching new levels of maturity.\n\nFrom the bluesy swing of \u201cWhen You\u2019ve Loved and Lost Like Frankie Has\u201d to the ethereal electro-synths of \u201cSketches From a Blind Man\u201d, CTS\u2019s minimalist pop instincts stand shoulder-to-shoulder with progressive metal and freewheeling improvisation in a true expression of their omnivorous musicality. Three of Metaphor\u2019s nine songs are Eastern European traditionals, but could easily be mistaken for the band\u2019s original tunes, so singular has their sound become. CTS retain their signature fiery maximalism while pushing the hooky, anthemic songwriting to the forefront. Bassist John Ferrara\u2019s new Taurus bass pedals and guitarist Gabriel Marin\u2019s new custom Vigier double-neck guitar add new dimensions to the band\u2019s already diverse sound.\n\nThis is an album born of comfort and growth. In the five years since World War Trio, the band has toured extensively, Marin and Ferrara have released side projects, and drummer/percussionist Jeff Mann has gone from a relative newcomer to a road-hardened veteran. After all this time, CTS knows how to create space for each other, how to finish each other\u2019s musical thoughts and sentences, how to think as three individuals but speak with one voice. You Are Literally a Metaphor is a statement of confidence, an assertion of identity from a band with no reservations and nothing to prove.\n\nCTS have performed in a half-dozen countries across three continents. They have shared the stage with a wide variety of artists, including: Victor Wooten, King Crimson Projekt, Wyclef Jean, Ozric Tentacles, Soulive, The Disco Biscuits, Papadosio, Turkuaz, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, Wayne Krantz and many others.

He has been described as \u2018a man who lives, breathes and emanates everything that is beautiful about deep house music and classic garage.\u2019 David is considered a \u2018rising star\u2019 within the dance community.\u2019 With influences varying from Barry White and the Love Unlimited Orchestra, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, Quincy Jones, the Jackson Five, Stevie Wonder, Parliament Funkadelic, the Isley Brothers and First Choice, among others it's easy to see why funk and soul have always been strong elements in his sound. In 1990, David began DJ\u2019ing at the After Dark in his hometown of Monterey, California. As his popularity grew past the boundaries of Monterey, he was invited to establish a residency at Tilt and the Sound Factory in San Francisco.\n\n\n\n\n\n1994, David opened and DJ\u2019ed at the popular club Lift at Club Dv8 (today known as Temple) in San Francisco. His success as a club DJ led to a DJ spot on commercial radio. David joined the popular radio show Your Mama\u2019s House on the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s number one radio station 106KMEL FM. Your Mama\u2019s House was the only \u2018true\u2019 house mix show on any major radio station in Northern California. As part of the Your Mama\u2019s House crew, David played a key role in exposing the masses to House Music in the San Francisco Bay Area till 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\n1995 David kicked off a seven year residency at San Francisco \u2018s legendary Club Universe \u2014 San Francisco\u2019s hottest Saturday night party. At Club Universe, David had the opportunity to play with many legendary DJs like Frankie Knuckles, Tony Humphries, Little Louie Vega, Tedd Patterson, Dave Morales, Danny Teneglia, London\u2019s Simon Dunmore & Aaron Ross, Los Angeles\u2019 Marques Wyatt, San Francisco\u2019s Miguel Migs, Mark Farina and Kaskade, Quentin Harris, Dennis Ferrer, DJ Spen, Timmy Regisford, Doc Martin, Osunlade, Danny Krivit, Joe Clausell, Derrick Carter Mr. V, Kenny Dope, DJ Spinna\u2014 just to name a few. His growing popularity accelerated David\u2019s natural progression into production. In 1998, he released a CD for Universe Sounds and Twisted America, \u2018Welcome to the Universe\u2019. This innovative CD, recorded live from Club Universe, reflects San Francisco\u2019s unique \u2018sound\u2019 and introduced the world to David Harness. Recognizing his talent, Twisted America quickly signed him to produce his first single, \u2018Get It Together\u2019, for a Twisted America compilation entitled \u2018A Little Bit of the Old, A Lot of the New\u2019. In 1999, David started Taboo in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District. Taboo started out of David\u2019s love of House music and his desire to provide a showcase for Bay Area talent as well as internationally known DJs.

Over the last 25 years, the four time Grammy-nominated DJ and producer has been astounding audiences across the world with his fusions of house, hip-hop, Latin, jazz, funk & soul, reggae, alternative pop and broken beats. By releasing literally thousands of original tracks and hundreds of remixes, Kenny has earned a reputation as a living encyclopedia of beats as both a solo artist, and as one-half of the legendary house duo, Masters At Work. At an early age, Kenny began absorbing the hip-hop beats being played at local house and block parties in Sunset Park, Brooklyn where he grew up. He began his musical career as a buyer for a local record shop called WNR Music Center, where he broadened his musical knowledge and found his love of \u201cdiggin\u201d for records. To date, Kenny\u2019s collection totals over 50,000 records. In the late 80\u2019s, Mike Delgado, a good friend and partner of Kenny\u2019s, organized a series of parties under the alias Masters At Work which the two of them would play at. Brooklyn DJ/producer Todd Terry attended these parties, and soon after, Kenny would cut school to watch Todd work on beats and record with singers and rappers. The combination of working at the store, learning how records were produced, and being around creative people influenced Kenny to begin his own productions. He then met King Grand (Russell Cole) and the two formed a group called KAOS. In 1987, Kenny and Todd produced the group\u2019s album titled Courts In Session, which was released the next year on Gregg Fore\u2019s label Bad Boy Records. Over time, Kenny had built up the Masters At Work brand from its party-origins, and in 1987 the club hits \u201cAlright Alright\u201d and \u201cDum Dum Cry\u201d were released by Todd Terry under the Masters At Work name. In return for the releases, Todd introduced Kenny to \u201cLittle\u201d Louie Vega, another talented young Bronx DJ. In 1990, Kenny and Louie officially began a creative partnership, appropriately dubbed Masters At Work (MAW), and their sound quickly became a force in the clubs. They were soon sought after by artists and labels, and eventually remixed everyone from Michael Jackson and Luther Vandross, to Madonna and Daft Punk. With Louie influenced by salsa, house and freestyle and Kenny by hip-hop and reggae, the two went on to become labeled by many as the most revolutionary house production team of the 90\u2019s. In 1993, Kenny and Louie collaborated on a project called Nuyorican Soul, which was named after their heritage (Puerto Rican), residence (New York City), and style of music (Soul). During a MAW gig at the Southport Weekender festival in England, Kenny was inspired by the dancers in the jazz room and had an idea for a syncopated beat style of music, which he dubbed the \u201cbroken beat\u201d style. Nuyorican Soul released its first single \u201cThe Nervous Track\u201d on Nervous Records shortly after, which became the first broken beat record ever released. In this time frame, not only did Kenny collaborate with Louie on MAW projects, he also produced and remixed tracks in the hip-hop and reggae scene. \u201cGet Up (Clap Your Hands)\u201d and \u201cThe Madd Racket\u201d were huge club tracks, and he also produced the Unreleased Project which featured Shaggy on the Gunshot\u201d track. Kenny\u2019s breakthrough as a solo artist came in 1995. One night, disheartened by the music that was being released throughout the business, Kenny went home and pulled out a series of classic records, and after three days he\u2019d produced an entire album, The Bucketheads. This was a huge turning point for him, as one track on the album, \u201cThe Bomb (These Sounds Fall Into My Mind)\u201d broke through the European pop charts and became his first major solo hit. Under different aliases, Kenny went on to release numerous projects on influential labels like Strictly Rhythm, Freeze, Nervous, Henry Street Records and TNT. Starting in 2000, and over the next decade, Kenny also went on to create classic remixes for the likes of R. Kelly, Shirley Bassey, The Jackson 5, DJ Gregory, Aaliyah, Soul Fuzion, and Kanye West. Alongside being a DJ and producer, Kenny also holds the title of record label owner. Frank Mendez of Nu Groove Records gave him his first label Dopewax, so that he\u2019d have an outlet to release anything he wanted. Kenny kept the label going after Nu Groove closed its doors, and it\u2019s been a consistent outlet of house music to this day. Initially, the releases were primarily raw, tracky, beat records produced by Kenny. He then started going into the vocal side of things, and even released remixes of Kanye West and Jill Scott tracks on the label. Demos started to come in, and now Dopewax is open to other artists & producers along with Kenny\u2019s music. Kenny has another label, Kay-Dee Records, which focuses on re-recording and releasing rare and classic music: everything from funk, soul & breaks, to gospel and movie soundtracks. It was initially born out of a challenge from Scottish DJ legend Keb Darge, who wanted to come up with a funk version of MAW\u2019s \u201cThe Nervous Track\u201d. Keb came back a short while later with \u201cNervous\u201d by The New Mastersounds, which would be the first release on Kay-Dee. The idea for Kay-Dee then became to record new productions with classic recording techniques. Kenny sought out to find old masters and produce entirely new mixes of them. Not to remix, but to mix down the original and create new masters to give collectors and DJ\u2019s a completely new version. Kay-Dee Records is a true haven for those with a passion for rare \u201creal\u201d music, and a deep love for vinyl. Aside from his own artist projects, Kenny has been a producer for a slew of other artists. For nearly fifteen years, he has produced music for R&B singer Raheem De Vaughn. Kenny produced eleven tracks on Raheem\u2019s 2011 album Love & War Masterpeace, which was Grammy-nominated for Best R&B Album Of The Year. Featured artists of those tracks include Ludacris, Wale, Damian Marley, Jill Scott and Anthony Hamilton. Two of Kenny\u2019s latest projects include producing rapper Rasheed Chappell\u2019s Future Before Nostalgia album, and also putting together a 12-piece funk & soul band called The Fantastic Souls. Throughout his career, Kenny admits there were times when he wasn\u2019t inspired to create music because of what was dominating the new direction of sound. However, learning to listen without prejudice has allowed him to continue to discover new styles, artists and musicians, and keep his love for the music alive. Kenny stays inspired and motivated not by doing what he likes, but doing what he loves. This is what makes his music timeless. Look out for him on tour this summer in Ibiza and throughout the rest of the world, and for new upcoming releases on his Dopewax imprint.

However, it\u2019s important to mention that Purple Disco Machine\u2019s impressive disco house grooves might not have even existed if it wasn\u2019t for his father introducing him, at an early age, to the classic funk sounds of the 70s and 80s. This early exposure had real influence on Tino and by the time he was a teenager, he didn\u2019t just want to listen to great music but also play it, produce it and be connected to the scene. Tino says \u201cThis was a really important time for me as I managed to land a job at a local record store and gain a DJ residency at my local club in Dresden. Neither job paid me any money but I could have as many records as I wanted from the record shop, so I had more than enough new music to play out on the weekend.\u201d With a rapidly expanding record collection and a DJ residency on-going, Tino craved to make his own music thus spending many years in the studio honing his sound and releasing tracks via a number of different projects/pseudonyms before giving birth to Purple Disco Machine. Outside the studio, Tino is a very in-demand touring DJ and his schedule has never been busier. Bringing his unparalleled sounds and unique mix of disco, nu disco, funk, house and deep house straight to the dancefloor at some of the world's finest clubs, festivals and events in countries, including; UK, USA, Australia, Russia, Germany, Holland, Spain, France plus many more. Purple Disco Machine is also a longstanding resident at the hugely successful \u2018Glitterbox\u2019 events in Ibiza which continues this year, plus the talented German has recently made his debut at the White Isle\u2019s iconic venue, Pacha. Indeed, 2017 is shaping up to be Purple Disco Machine\u2019s most prolific year to date, with the announcement of his debut album, \u2018Soulmatic\u2019, forthcoming via Australia\u2019s tastemaker label, Sweat It Out. Aiming to cover all aspects of \u2018disco\u2019 influenced dance music; the album will combine traditional disco house club tracks with funk, soul, boogie and indie disco jams. Collaborations include the likes of Faithless, Hip Hop legend Kool Keith, Bag Raiders, Duane Harden and Karen Harding as well as a number of very exciting newcomers. The album\u2019s pre-campaign club-focused taster single \u2018Body Funk\u2019, released in early May, has set the tone and the bar high by becoming BBC Radio 1\u2019s most played dance record of the month and scoring double #1 chart success on Beatport and Traxsource. Throw in a number high-profile remixes such as the aforementioned rework of the Gorillaz as well live dates in countries from Ibiza to America, and it\u2019s clear to see why this year is one of the German funk machine\u2019s most exciting chapters in his already illustrious career.

The arrival of his new double album neXt allows us to share his equally promising vision of the future. Andre Tanneberger's sharp rise to excellence began in the mid 1990s when his debut single 9 PM (Till I Come) shot to the very top of the UK charts and scored top 10 successes in many other countries around the globe. His creative spirit continued to flourish with an impressive string of hits like Ecstasy, Let U Go, What About Us, Move On and When It Ends It Starts Again. Gold and platinum awards in numerous territories underlined his status, mirrored by his constant presence in the prestigious DJ Mag Top 100 rankings for a decade and a half. ATB is one of just a handful of musicians to have emerged from the German club scene to become worldwide superstars \u2013 from Australia to Asia, Mexico to Poland, Russia and, above all, in the USA.\n\nATB:\n\u201cThese days everybody is talking about the massive effect EDM had on America \u2013 and the role played by ATB as things began to change. I was there from the very beginning, I saw how the crowds grew and venues got bigger. On my first USA tour back in 2001 I was one of the first to insist on getting my own stage so the audience could really see who was playing, to create a more lasting impression. DJs are now undeniably stars in America but that is something which has taken years to develop.\u201d\n\n\nSince his breakthrough two decades ago, ATB has released nine albums, five of which came in double album format. His most recent album Contact entered the German charts at #5.\nThe medial capital X in the title of his newest work neXt is a reference to the Roman numeral which marks his tenth opus.\n\nATB:\n\u201cMy taste in music is really broad. When I record an album, I want it reflect my interest in the full spectrum of electronic club music \u2013 from energetic, pumping tracks to chilled out, ambient pieces. And you can't squeeze all of that onto one CD.\u201d\n\nEvery time ATB has released a double album, one disc has featured club tracks and the other one has showcased his ambient compositions. It is worth noting that ATB has made a mockery of the \u201cone hit wonder\u201d theory which so often accompanies a #1 hit single. He has gone on to establish himself as a genuine album artist whose vast fan base all over the world regularly purchase his double albums.\n\nATB:\n\u201cMy sound feeds on the long distances I have travelled and how they influence my state of mind. Whenever I am touring and playing to large audiences, I am drawn to dynamic tracks, sharing their energy with everybody in the crowd. But when I'm in my car, separated from the world, I tend to listen to quieter tunes. You need both in your life.\u201d\n\nATB has thus managed to settle into a rhythm which enables him to collect ideas when he is out on tour or playing DJ gigs and then assimilating these for an album every two to three years. The gaps between releases may have stretched a little, largely due to the amount of time he spends on the road, but the rewards for his fans are as rich as ever. ATB always finds new ways to refine his distinctive electronic sounds, introduing new voices \u2013 as he does so prominently on neXt.\n\nATB:\n\u201cI like to maintain close contact with my fans, which is now easier thanks to social media, but I'm also in touch with other musicians, producers, DJs and singers, everybody's exchanging ideas. Sometimes singers approach me directly or a producer might recommend an artist he has discovered. And if the voice strikes a chord inside me, you can be sure I'll invite him or her into the studio!\u201d\n\nSean Ryan and Jan Loechel are among the familiar voices to return on neXt, but there are also quite a few artists who feature for the first time, including Lenachka, HALIENE and Mike Schmid, each bringing his or her own intensity and charisma to the production with amazing results.\nIn one sense, each new ATB album bears a hallmark of respect from a fresh generation of vocalists. Their voices find themselves embedded in ATB's unparalleled trance landscape which resonates with classic qualities. Andre is also more than willing to embrace contemporary updates on every record, as revealed by a healthy guestlist of contributions from producer or DJ friends and colleagues such as Myon, Andrew Rayel, Robbin & Jonnis, Alyx Ander, Anova Fade.\n\n\nATB:\n\u201cNearly all of my tracks can be played on guitar or piano \u2013 I see myself as a songwriter and I aim to convey emotions through melodies. Who knows, maybe one day I'll release an unplugged album...?\u201d\n\n\nNow, however, it is time to focus all our attention on neXt where ATB has, once again, crafted a compelling creative arc across two albums in one. Perhaps the best example of this is the single \u201cMessage Out To You\u201d, a collaboration with F51, where melody and voice combine so effectively.\n\n\nATB:\n\u201cLife is one great big source of inspiration. Especially when I'm travelling through America, Asia or Australia, there is so much to take in. Not only the people and places, but I get to hear so many different styles of music, I can pick up on microtrends as they happen and weave them into my own music, creating something new yet, at the same time, bearing the distinctive ATB signature.\u201d\n\n\nATB processes this input incessantly \u2013 in his mind, in demos, sketching out new compositions, testing new tracks in live situations. The actual recording sessions for neXt took place in one seamless phase, which goes some way to explaining why the album sounds so harmonious without sacrificing any of its diversity.\n\nATB:\n\u201cWhat really matters, is that I have a clear vision of the album in my head. And that takes time. I reach a point which you might call zero. Once I have arrived there, I can begin. The vocalists are fully integrated into the process, most of them are songwriters themselves so they often come up with melodies which can flow into my songs as essential elements of the tracks.\n\nThis is one of the main reasons why I can stay true to my own sound whilst still having the capacity to surprise people with new twists in the music.\u201d\n\nneXt is an ATB reality check for the year 2017: with 20 years and 10 albums in the game Andre Tanneberger now presents 25 new tracks, individually and collectively a timeless document of his art.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1214 Apollo Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94085", "Artist": "The_ash_khajvandi", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9177541.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.994914, 37.378528], "Date": "Sat Nov 9 2019", "EventDate": "2019-11-09", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Blues-Rock, Cowpunk, Roots Rock, Garage Rock, Indie Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "Quarter Note Bar & Grill", "moreBioInfo": "Six-string slinging Ash Khajvandi a.k.a.
