It's decided that we should respect each band and we should have separate groups for both bands.\n\n\nPopular French rock group Dolly got together in Nantes, a town in the west of France, in 1991. Their formation came about thanks to drummer Thierry Lacroix and singer Emmanuelle Monet - aka Manu - who shared a mutual passion for English and American music. The Anglophile duo teamed up with two musician friends - bass-player Mick Chamberlin and guitarist Nicolas Bonniere (who was just 15 at the time!) - and went on to make a name for themselves on the local music scene as Dolly and C\u00b0.\n\nDolly and C\u00b0's early influences might have been lifted from the best chapters of an English/American rock compendium - indeed, the group's sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Blondie, Prince, the Pixies and the Smashing Pumpkins. But lead singer Manu's greatest source of inspiration was the work of English indie diva PJ Harvey. The young French singer was fascinated by Harvey's deep, melancholy vocals and, after seeing PJ in concert, Manu decided to accompany her own singing on guitar. Performing extensively on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 soon began to build up an extensive repertoire (most of which was written by Manu). And before long the group attracted a massive following of fans.\n\nEncouraged by this early success on the local music scene, Dolly and C\u00b0 went into the studio to begin work on their d\u00e9but album. After producing a mini album (featuring six tracks), Dolly and C\u00b0 went on to produce their first full-length album themselves. (The album, entitled simply \"Dolly and C\u00b0, actually scored a considerable hit on the national music scene, selling over 85,000 copies).\n\nShortly after the release of their d\u00e9but album, the group underwent several major changes in their line-up, re-inventing themselves as Dolly. The new-look Dolly went on to sign a recording deal with the East West label and then returned to the studio to set to work on a new CD album.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nDolly (\u30c9\u30ea\u30a3, \uff24\uff4f\uff4c\uff4c\uff59) is an japanese rock band.\nThey started their activities in 2005.\n\nMember:\nVocals: Mitsu\nGuitar: Masa\nGuitar: Yuina (ex Luecie)\nBass : Hachi\nDrums : Takashi (ex Plastic Tree)\n\nThe release Ussetsu Drop had their first proper PV with more of a budget than the previous.\nNow they have just released the Red and White singles of the tricolore opera trilogy making a total of 3 pvs and 9 songs.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Moe ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "VIRTUAL: John Moe with Sean Doolittle and Linda Holmes"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Waterloo Revival ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8810829.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "When WATERLOO REVIVAL\u2019s Cody Cooper met his bandmate George Birge in middle school, he inspired his new friend to express himself through music \u2014 a path that drastically affected both their lives. \"By seventh grade I was hooked and Cody and I were writing songs together,\u201d George admits.\nThe duo continued to play together through high school, but parted ways so the guys could pursue an education. Cody headed to the University of North Texas in Denton, while George stayed in their hometown of Austin to attend the University of Texas. The pair would play together during Cody's visits back home all through college. By 2012, their musical chemistry was undeniable and George made the hard sell, convincing Cody to return home in order for them to focus all their energy into music. WATERLOO REVIVAL was soon born, taking its moniker from their beloved hometown.\n\"Before it was Austin, our hometown was called Waterloo,\" Cody explains. \"Eventually, it was renamed to honor the 'Father of Texas' Stephen F. Austin.\"\n\"We were so heavily influenced by the Austin music scene growing up,\" George adds, \"we decided on the name Waterloo Revival in order to bring Austin music heritage to the rest of the world.\"\n\"We played one show in Austin and had 200 friends show up,\" George explains. \"Fans were really supportive. We thought, 'Okay, it seems like this is something people are really going to get behind.' We started a campaign and were able to fund the entire project from fan contributions.\"\nContinuing that momentum, WATERLOO REVIVAL channeled their entrepreneurial musicianship into more writing sessions, commuting to Nashville over the next year to hone their craft and acquaint themselves with Music City. Through a chance connection, George arranged a meeting with Toby Keith's manager, TK Kimbrell, who promptly signed the boys to TKO Artist Management.\nIn June of 2016 WATERLOO REVIVAL signed to Toby Keith\u2019s record label, Show Dog Nashville, and joined him on the \u201cToby Keith Interstates & Tailgates Tour sponsored by Ford F-Series\u201d where they continued to push their music out to the world, developing a dedicated fan base along the way.

With a voice that touches somewhere deep inside, Alyssa\u2019s soulful sound and powerful lyrics will send you jet-setting into a broad range of human emotions. Growing up on the open roads of America, with her RCA country recording artists parents, Baillie & The Boys, made it impossible for Alyssa not to witness the power and magic of music. At just 3 weeks old, her cradle was the gentle rocking of a tour bus. Her play ground encompassed sound checks at fairs and festivals and back stage dressing rooms at a slew of different venues including the Grand Ole Opry and Country Music Award shows, and her \u201cextended family\u201d consisted of managers, promoters, roadies, musicians and other fellow mainstream country artists.\n\nAt the age of 3, Alyssa performed on the Ralph Emory television show, Nashville Now. Where her version of the Leslie Gore classic; It\u2019s My Party brought the house down in front of millions of national viewers. At age 10, one of those major acts, Kenny Rogers, decided Alyssa was the perfect child singer to record a duet with him on his Christmas CD, Christmas From The Heart. By age 13, Alyssa had her first batch of songs written and received an endorsement from Gretsch Guitars. She had figured out her own unique style of guitar playing with open tunings inspired by Joni Mitchell. By age 16 she landed her first 50 date tour opening up for Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives. It soon became obvious that she was the real deal, not only as a musician and singer but as a prolific songwriter as well.\n\nWhile in high-school, Alyssa became a go-to session singer for people like Christian artist Matt Maher, where she created her own layered harmony vocal approach from years of hearing her parents sing together. Her songs started finding their way into television shows, (Switched! on ABC Family, MTV), movies, as well as getting her first cuts on other artists projects.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Alyssa received a full scholarship from Sennheiser to Paul McCartney\u2019s Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts in Liverpool England, where she would spend the next three years earning a degree in Sound Technology while continuing to perform in local venues throughout Europe. While playing at a venue called The Zanzibar in Liverpool, Alyssa was spotted by Liverpool Rock Star Pete Wylie and was asked to join his band playing electric guitar and singing background vocals. Alyssa of course said yes, and experienced what most artists never experience; a private performance requested by the Queen to help support one of Liverpool\u2019s local charities. A performance with Ringo Starr at the 800th Anniversary of Liverpool\u2019s, \u201cCapital Of Culture 2008\u201d event; a performance slot at one of the UK\u2019s largest music festivals; Knowsley Hall on the same bill as The Who, and from there on scored her own slots performing on the Acoustic stage at Glastonbury in 2009, and a UK tour opening for Raul Malo of The Mavericks.\n\nWhile at LIPA, Alyssa was inspired by their music community and the extreme amount of talented people attending the school. She lived in Lennon Studios, an apartment complex that used to be the old maternity ward where John Lennon was born. Her incredibly unique experiences abroad inspired her debut album, The English Diaries, an all acoustic intimate collection of songs she produced and recorded herself in her one bedroom Beatles inspired flat.\n\nAfter graduating LIPA and receiving her diploma from Paul McCartney himself, Alyssa returned to Nashville and signed her first publishing deal with Rondor Music. While signed to Rondor, she produced and released her sophomore album Love Hard which was backed by a 10k dollar Kickstarter Campaign and landed one of the biggest nationwide commercial placements of 2012 with her song, \u201cI Make My Own Sunshine,\u201d inspired by Liverpool\u2019s rainy weather. It was featured in a Lowe\u2019s commercial, earning over 50,000 downloads in its first 3 months and over 1 million plays on Spotify. She had no idea at the time that her song would later be heard by Steven Tyler and recorded on his first ever solo album, We\u2019re All Somebody From Somewhere and that she would be the only solo writer on his debut #1 billboard Country album.\n\nAlyssa\u2019s many other accomplishments in the singer/songwriter community include: Writing with Jeffrey Steele, Michelle Branch, Hunter Hayes, and JD Souther, writing three songs on Jessie James Decker\u2019s top 5 Billboard Country album \u201cComin\u2019 Home\u201d and co-writing top 40 billboard country radio single, \u201cLights Down Low\u201d, winning Canadian songwriter of the year and song of the year for \u201cI Only Smoke When I Drink\u201d by the Small Town Pistols, co-writing Jana Kramer\u2019s latest country radio single \u201cCircles\u201d and a #17 AC Billboard Chart Christmas duet with Matthew & Gunner Nelson called \u201cThis Christmas\u201d which she wrote with the twins and her father, Michael Bonagura. She\u2019s also had three #1 hits in Australia with Morgan Evans and Chelsea Basham and produced music for Jo Dee Messina & Rachel Reinert of Gloriana.\n\nAt 28 years old, Alyssa has become a songwriting seamstress for a number of artists, a producer, and a band member of the west coast folk & classic rock n\u2019 roll sounds of The Sisterhood Band with friend Ruby Stewart, all while simultaneously having a career as a solo artist. She\u2019s created life long friendships with fellow songwriters, artists and musicians, and has been called \u201cA fixture on Nashville\u2019s indie singer-songwriter scene\u201d by Rolling Stone. It\u2019s been over 4 years since she\u2019s released a solo project, but when you hear her newest record Road Less Traveled, you\u2019ll know it was worth the wait.\n\nAfter an entire summer of recording plans with an outside producer had fallen through, Alyssa turned to her boyfriend Graham Whitford for guidance on what was the best way forward for the songs she so much believed in. They decided to call long time friend and engineer Mark Petaccia to see if he was available to help record at his studio Petti Sound in Berry Hill. By a simple twist of fate, he had 7 days free.\n\nHer closest friends and family who are all a part of the Nashville underground music community decided to come together and help her create Road Less Traveled without the help of a label and purely for the love and support of their friend. The entire album was recorded live, produced by Alyssa & Mark Petaccia, Mastered by Richard Dodd and executive produced by Karen Whitford. Alyssa showcases her multi-instrumental talents by playing acoustic guitar in her signature open tunings, Piano, Ukulele, Lap Steel, Electric guitar, Bass, B3 and Harmonica. She\u2019s backed by Graham Whitford, Caleb Crosby, and Noah Denney (3/4ths of Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown), String arrangers and players Eleonore Denig and Molly Cherryholmes (Mountain Heart), Kevin McGowan, Tarka Layman, fellow artist and songwriter Davis Naish, and her father Michael Bonagura on Electric guitar.\n\nRoad Less Traveled showcases Alyssa as a solo artist in her truest form to date and shares the journey of finding her own voice and paving her own path as an independent Country artist. It encompasses elements of early Sheryl Crow mixed with Joni Mitchell like vocals. You'll hear so many iconic female influences on this project. Alyssa blends them all extremely well to come up with a sound that is familiar in its harkening back to the greats from multiple decades, yet completely unique and unlike anything else one would hear today. Road Less Traveled comes out for pre-order 8.19.16 and will be available 9.23.16.", "otherInfo": "Alyssa will be streaming from IG Live on Vox's instagram for their MiniSessions series!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jesse &amp; Joy ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jordann Funk ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Livestream: https://www.facebook.com/RadioWoodstock"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sean Doolittle ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "VIRTUAL: John Moe with Sean Doolittle and Linda Holmes"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ Ghost ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7014443.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Hardstyle, Electronic", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "International DJ/Producer for over 18 years.

Originally from just outside Washington, D.C., Tanya discovered her supreme vocal skills at a young age and promptly pursued a career in music and acting.

Producer and drummer, Ken Coomer (Wilco, Uncle Tupelo) lined up the best rhythm and lead players in Nashville to create Elliott\u2019s greatest album to date.

Townes would be proud.\u201d - Will Kimbrough about Wreck and Ruin\n\nOn his 21st album, RINGGOLD, Elliott recorded songs at his home studio in Iowa. The studio, built in his grandparents\u2019 former home, helped him connect with his roots and explore difficult songs about those closest to him. It was released in 2017.\n\nToday, with his band The Redemptions, there is a marked shift in his sound that is entirely original. Elliott released his 22nd album, Rest Heavy: The Sun Studio Sessions, in 2018. Greg Brown said of the new album, it\u2019s \u201clow, loose and full of juice. This album\u2019s got a lot of life to it.\u201d\n\nWith Rest Heavy, Elliott shows his love of roots-rock, soul, and blues music with a rocking band behind his artfully crafted songs and gravelly delivery. Elliott, performing on acoustic guitar and harmonica, is joined by his full band, The Redemptions, including Tommy Lewis, Travis McFarlane, Kevin Boehnke, Joseph Cafaro, and Jim Van Dorn. The self-produced album was recorded at the famed Sun Studio in Memphis, TN by Ples Hampton. Hampton said, \u201cIt was honestly one of the best sessions I've ever had up here. This is gold.\u201d\n\nIn November 2019 Elliott released a new album, King Pelican. This album holds 8 tracks recorded live with his band, The Redemptions, during a set for The Sun Studio Sessions documentary series featured on PBS. The show is currently airing nationwide.

He's often been told, that he has a sound that combines a healthy balance of Pop, Folk, Rock and Americana with a voice that is reminiscent of the late Jim Croce. He grew up in the northern Florida panhandle and was raised on a diet of 90's alt rock and 70's folk music. Picking up the vibes from positively hopeless cases from the darkest places, he creates a sound uniquely his own - pop-infused rock.\n\nHe just released, \u201cPromise Me\u201d his latest single, and will be heading out on the road supporting American Idol winner, Taylor Hicks, this October.\n\nAfter his hit single, \"Are You Listening\", Brian's released a collection of singles, \"Promise Me\", \"Don't Own Much\", \"Underwater\" and \"Learn to Be\" produced in Los Angeles by Jon Levine (Rachel Platten, Andy Grammer). \"Learn to Be\" charted #1 most added for 3 weeks in a row tied with John Mayer on the US FMQB A/C Charts. This single, poppy and bold, reflects on the life lessons of learning to live without a crutch, and the liberation of breaking free. The music video for \"Underwater\" premiered on the Huffington Post, boasting the headline \"Sublimely Gorgeous Music From Brian Mackey\"\n\nIn 2018, Brian toured with Kate Voegele + Tyler Hilton on their European tour, as well as with Howie Day, and Tyler Hilton. He\u2019s also toured with David Bromberg, with Ron Pope in Europe, and Jon McLaughlin for select dates.\n\nHis music video for \"Underwater\" premiered on the Huffington Post. It was also officially nominated for an HMMA award for \"Best Independent Music Video\u201d, along with his video for, \u201cDon\u2019t Own Much.\n\nIn 2015, Brian released his first full-length album Broken Heartstrings, a collection of pop infused American folk-rock, also in Nashville. The music took him through a very personal journey, spurred by loss and then renewal and signified a new beginning for Brian. He assembled a talented team: Producer Sam Ashworth, Engineer Richie Biggs (Tom Petty, The Civil Wars), bassist Mark Hill (Carrie Underwood, Keith Urban) and guitarist Jeff King, (Reba McEntyre).\n\nBroken Heartstrings yielded the single, \u201cAre You Listening,\u201d which, after being featured on YouTube by gamer Gronkh about the PlayStation 4 game Until Dawn, became a runaway hit in Germany. The song peaked at #8 on the A/C Radio Charts in the US, charted on German iTunes, was on the \u2018100 Most Sold\u2019 chart on Amazon Germany, had over 400k streams on Spotify and resulted in sold out shows throughout the country. Another single, \u201cAmerica,\u201d was used in an Armagosa Conservancy commercial supporting the non-profit organization dedicated to preserving the Amargosa River in California. He returned to Germany in May of 2016, debuting in the UK, and toured with Camplified in July and August 2016 around the Northeast region.\n\n\n\nPERSONAL HISTORY\n\nFrom a very early age, the youngest of three had an ear for music. His grandmother played piano, sitting in at local clubs, and his mother dabbled in song writing. There was nothing Brian liked more than music. \u201cI used to \u2018steal\u2019 albums from my brothers and parents. I remember listening to Queen\u2019s \u201cNight at the Opera\u201d over and over and over. I never got sick of it, never got sick of listening to the radio or hearing new music. I liked everything, it didn\u2019t matter what it was as long as the musicians played instruments!\u201d\n\nWhile schoolwork didn\u2019t really grab Brian, the attention he got from being good at music did. \u201cWhen I was 7, my music teacher asked me to sing the 'Star Spangled Banner' for the class. Everyone was so complimentary that it left me inspired and confident. I then went on to sing in church, plays and the school choir.\u201d Having learned piano from his grandmother, and guitar from just a few lessons, Brian was really eager to challenge himself by playing music he heard on the radio rather than what was assigned during lessons. \u201cI would find excuses to stay home from school so I could sit in my room and play the guitar. Something inside me was confident that I was on the right path. I didn\u2019t follow the road that I was encouraged to take, but at the same time, the direction I was heading in felt natural to me.\u201d\n\nBrian tooled around with some bands in Florida, where he admits the warm weather and party atmosphere made it easy to score gigs. Wanting to experience four seasons, he moved around the country and lived in a Volvo 240 wagon \u2013 washing dishes by day, bar gigging by night. He landed in New York, where he continued to play in bands until he had an epiphany: \u201cIt dawned on me that I would be better off \u2013and would grow more as an artist \u2013 if I wrote my own songs and composed my own music. I wanted to live to my full potential and felt like being a solo artist was the best way for me to do that.\u201d\n\nThat fateful decision opened many doors for Brian, some leading to great things, some leading to frustration, but always ending with a learning experience that helped him develop. One of the first in a series of steps to improve came when Brian flew to Nashville for a meeting with producer Sam Ashworth (The Civil Wars, Switchfoot, Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith), where they recorded \u201cPainted Red.\u201d This track ended up on Brian\u2019s first EP, Feng Shui for Slobs (whose title came from his landlady who wanted Brian\u2019s small 1-bedroom apartment to have \u201cfeng-shui\u201d), and became Brian\u2019s very first commercial placement, turning up on the Disney Channel\u2019s Naturally Sadie.\n\nHis second EP, Brian Mackey Red, was a very different period all together. Brian was in a management contract with a successful producer, and although he flew Brian to Los Angeles to work with a lot of well-known musicians, Brian was ultimately unhappy with the music. He returned to Nashville, recording Honest Love, his third EP. It\u2019s been described by Brian as \u201cMy breaking away album, my independence flag; I made the EP with my own money and did it exactly the way I wanted it.\u201d The title track, \u201cHonest Love,\u201d as well songs \u201cColor Blue,\u201d and \u201cOut on the Road,\u201d have garnered features in TV, Film, and National and International Branding Campaigns. A few among them are CMT Edge, A&E, Lifetime, Travel Channel, Arla Foods Demark, Unicef UK and Rebel One Pictures.", "otherInfo": "Join me for a LIVESTREAM Fundraising Event! - May 14th 7pm EST\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/brianmackeyfans/posts/10157321174222205\n\nAs our world reopens, the affects of the pandemic will be seen more through the struggles of mental health.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

The result is the most wide-ranging musical effort of his career, a set of songs that examines issues of mortality, survival, connection, and celebration in ways that are both deeply personal and profoundly universal.\n\nIn 2007, the singer-songwriter began working with the Musicians on Call program, playing music bedside for hospital patients. He went on to play at VA hospitals, for the Wounded Warriors organization, and for the Melodic Caring Project, singing via video for children who are quarantined, too ill to have friends or family visit in their rooms.\n\n\u201cEverything about the connection of music hit me harder,\u201d he says of these efforts, \u201cand I thought, \u2018How can I be helpful, and reach out in a more real way?\u2019 Songs have become a bridge, a way for me to reach outside myself and into other people\u2019s lives. My mission now is to connect with people, to still have fun, but to have my intention be more outwardly based, and from a place of giving and service.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Lee suffered a difficult loss of his own. \u201cMy grandmother, who was the matriarch of our very large family, and the love centerpiece in all of our gathering, got really sick, and very suddenly passed away,\u201d he says. \u201cShe showed love in the small ways\u2014in how she smiled at you when you walked in her front door, how she made a piece of buttered toast a delicacy, how she spoke with such warmth and familiarity to her mailman. In all deeds, she was graceful and beautiful and kind. So her falling ill so quickly and violently hit us all hard.\n\n\u201cAt one point during her last night,\u201d he continues, \u201cit was just her and me in the room. The rest of the family left, because the doctor told my mother and me that they thought she was stable, but then something went wrong, and she started to fade very quickly. It was around 4:30 in the morning, she was fighting for breath, sweating, and fighting for her life. I stood with her, and held her hand, hoping that she could hear me. I felt totally helpless, and while I wiped away the sweat from her forehead, and words all felt worthless, I started to sing to her. I sang \u2018Somewhere Over the Rainbow\u2019 \u2018What a Wonderful World,\u2019 and my grandfather\u2019s favorite song, \u2018Born to Lose.\u2019 She looked up at me and smiled a faint smile before she drifted into her final sleep. A couple of the overnight nurses were standing in the doorway, and in a very tragic moment, we all shared a breath. It\u2019s in these moments that I realize how sacred music is, and how the world, which seems in such disarray, can find simple solace and connection in the light of song.\u201d\n\nThis incident informs much of MY NEW MOON; Lee points particularly to the tracks \u201cAll You Got is a Song\u201d and \u201cHang On, Hang On.\u201d But, he points out, the album is as much about other people\u2019s stories as it is his own. \u201cAll this work in the last decade comes to the fore,\u201d he says. \u201cI know many people who have experienced tragedy, and whether it be a friend, or a friend\u2019s child, or a fan I meet at a coffee shop who shares their story with me, I take them all to heart. I want to connect, and to be open to those who have hardship, so that that they know I hear their stories in the same way that they hear mine, and that we\u2019re in this together. I don\u2019t want to overwhelm the listener with sorrow, but I am inspired by these friends and families, and want to help their light find shape.\u201d\n\nMuch of Lee\u2019s recent work bore the stamp of strong producers\u2014Joey Burns of Calexico on 2011\u2019s Mission Bell (which debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200, Amazon, and iTunes charts, and spun off a hit single with \"Windows are Rolled Down\") and Jay Joyce (Little Big Town, Eric Church, Cage the Elephant) on 2013\u2019s Mountains of Sorrow, Rivers of Song. But for his last album, 2016\u2019s Spirit, Lee took over the helm.\n\n\u201cProducing my last album was cool, and I\u2019m very grateful for the opportunity,\u201d he says, \u201cbut after I did it, I realized that I had a lot to learn, and that I wanted to focus my energy on my performances, and on the songwriting. For this album, I wanted to open up, and push myself to collaborate with someone who was passionate and creative and could really partner with me to elevate the album from a sonic and musical standpoint.\u201d\n\nFor the new album, Lee turned to producer Tony Berg, who has worked with everyone from Public Image Ltd to Peter Gabriel, and moved operations to Berg\u2019s Zeitgeist Studio in Los Angeles. Such notable musicians as keyboardist Benmont Tench; drummers Matt Chamberlain and Chris Dave; and multi-instrumentalists Blake Mills, Ethan Gruska, and Jaron Olevsky all participated in the sessions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to grow as a musician, and to put myself around people who are better than me,\u201d says Lee. \u201cI really don\u2019t speak the technical or theory-based language of music, and there are times in the rendering of an arrangement that those skills are extremely vital. Tony was great at that. He has a very unique and progressive interest in harmony, and a childlike wonder and energy coupled with a lifetime of experience. He\u2019s a big-hearted man, and he really helped me explore realms that I didn\u2019t quite know how to reach. His ideology is, \u2018Let\u2019s go further left than we want and see what happens.\u2019 \u201c\n\nLee came in with fifty songs to consider, but knew that there were a few that were key to the project. \u201cA lot of this starts with the song \u2018Little Light,\u2019 which is the story of a family I grew close with whose daughter had very serious cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful kid who was suffering a lot, and sometimes she and her dad would FaceTime me from her hospital room, while she was going through chemo, and I would sing to her. I wanted to write her something with hope, and to remind her that she was awesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Fade Away\u201d was written for a friend whose child passed (\u201cI was trying to embody something he may have felt, or maybe how I might have felt in that situation\u201d), while \u201cWhiskey on Ice\u201d was inspired by the unexpected death of another friend. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to his mother,\u201d says Lee, \u201ctrying to walk down the hallway with her in the middle of the night and feel what she feels.\u201d\n\nMuch of the material on MY NEW MOON was altered dramatically during the recording process. \u201cWe broke these songs apart and put them back together,\u201d says Lee. \u201cThe first track\u2014\u2018No More Darkness, No More Light\u2019\u2014was originally titled differently, and had none of these same lyrics. We put in one musical element, then rebuilt the whole idea around that, then scrapped that and worked on the layers that we had created. Then I rewrote the song with a lyric more appropriate for where the song was now musically. It was frustrating and teeth-gnashing, but I\u2019m up for the challenge. I learned a lot and grew a lot, but it took a lot of slow-motion movement to ease into it.\u201d (Lee notes that \u201cHang On, Hang On\u201d is the album\u2019s only song that is acoustic guitar-based; \u201cfor everything else, there was a better idea.\u201d)\n\nThis sense of digging deeper, of fearlessly bringing out the real essence of a song\u2019s meaning, lies at the very heart of MY NEW MOON. \u201cIn these days of political crisis, I do think there\u2019s also this feeling that there could be renewal,\u201d says Amos Lee. \u201cThat\u2019s what the title of the record is about\u2014a seemingly utter darkness that\u2019s also a beginning. I know that the times I\u2019ve grown the most have been in times of crisis, when I wasn\u2019t sure who I was.\n\n\u201cIn listening, and trying to connect to someone else\u2019s pain or someone else\u2019s victories, there\u2019s a lot of fertile ground to be found. Just a beginning, a simple place to start. A conversation, a song, to see and feel someone else\u2019s humanity in your own. That\u2019s always been my interest; sometimes I get there and often I don\u2019t, but I hope in these songs, someone finds a place to start.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Livestream tonight at 730pm eastern. come listen, and maybe watch me eat a cookie.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/am0slee"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Brick + Mortar LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10361458.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Thu May 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-14", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie Electronic, Whatever You Want It To Be., Pop, Indie, Hip Hop", "Time": "11:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Follow us on IG & Twitter @brickandmortar\n\n\nWe are probably the weirdest band you will see live.", "otherInfo": "Have you seen this ridiculous set yet?

Yet the homespun, heartwarming music of family-oriented indie folk group GoldenOak provides evidence that the dense woods of the Pine Tree State might just be a better muse than the slick streets of New York and LA.\n\nGoldenOak is driven by the songwriting and harmonies of the brother-sister duo Zak and Lena Kendall. After a bit of a recording hiatus and a shift in personnel, the group is back with an enchanting pair of songs. \u201cRiver\u201d and \u201cPoet And The Painter\u201d find this collective simultaneously building on previous strengths while also striking out in an interesting new direction.\n\nZak Kendall explains that he and his sister had a heart-to-heart about how the band should sound once some intra-band changes took place. \u201cWith the original lineup, we were very much a four-piece group. Everybody had similar roles in the band and there was not really much of a lead, per se. As the band evolved and those two bandmates left, Lena and I kind of sat down and said, \u2018What we were doing is changing up, but what\u2019s staying the same is our relationship to each other, our musical journey as siblings.\u2019 I think with this music we\u2019ve kind of settled into that role. We\u2019ve learned to really understand and work with each other, write together more, bounce ideas off each other.\u201d\n\nThe pair leaned into the family-oriented dynamic when they dove into the new material, recorded at Rustic Studios in Portland. \u201cThe new stuff is built around that relationship and particularly our vocals and our harmonies,\u201d Zak says. \u201cLike on \u2018Poet And The Painter\u2019, there\u2019s no lead vocals on it. It\u2019s us singing harmonies the whole time, kind of like Simon & Garfunkel\u2019s early stuff. When I wrote \u2018River\u2019, I said to Lena, \u201cI\u2019m writing this song, but I want you to sing it.\u201d That was the first time that I had written lyrics for Lena to sing. And so it really became the closest to a partnership that it\u2019s ever been for us. We were really working closely together on this new stuff.\u201d\n\nEven as Zak and Lena found a new direction by honoring their musical bond, which they first started to form during campfire singalongs as youngsters, the new members of the band, bassist Mike Knowles and drummer Jackson Cromwell, also helped determine the sound of this single. Zak explains the process since the release of the band\u2019s 2017 EP Foxgloves: \u201cIt\u2019s been like a year-and-a-half or so since we released music. We were touring with a cellist and a trumpet player at the time. They were big focal points of a lot of our arrangements and a lot of our writing. When they left, we started playing with Mike and Jackson. And they started shaping the direction of what we were going to be putting out, because we wanted it to sound like our live set was sounding. It took a long period before we started working on new stuff because we were adjusting to having a new lineup and getting to know each other as musicians and bandmates. As we felt we were starting to click, we started working on a new stuff.\u201d\nSpeaking of that new stuff, \u201cRiver\u201d manages to seamlessly connect two different pieces of music that Zak had been writing. The moody music, accompanying verses about how political shifts are mirrored by the changing seasons, segues into a more upbeat outro, connected by a gorgeous moment of brother and sister singing a cappella, \u201cI\u2019ve come to witness the things I can\u2019t see.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cPoet And The Painter\u201d find the two in close-harmony throughout, but the shuffle of the rhythm section adds some momentum to the lyrical musings on the potency of nature.\n\nIn many ways, the themes of GoldenOak\u2019s music are driven by their home base. \u201cMaine is such an interesting place to be an artist,\u201d Zak says. \u201cIt\u2019s so remote in a lot of ways. And the landscape and the woods are so inspiring. People are often spread out, but there\u2019s also this amazing artistic community, not only in Portland but also in the towns all over Maine.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing in a place like Maine, we\u2019re not surrounded by buildings. I think the art is very reflective of the landscape, the nature of Maine. As you walk through the woods, you never see the same thing twice. And I think that represents the Maine music scene in a perfect way.\u201d\n\nThat music scene has thrown its arms around GoldenOak, and, in return, the band is helping to draw more attention to it with these excellent new songs. \u201cThe Portland music scene is so friendly and welcoming,\u201d Zak says. \u201cI think, unfortunately, a lot of music scenes get competitive by nature. But that\u2019s something you just don\u2019t find in Portland. There\u2019s just a lot of fantastic people involved in it that kind of have that \u2018Mainer\u2019 attitude to help each other out and support each other.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pedrito Martinez LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616665.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Salsa, Latin", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dee Dee Bridgewater LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8392836.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Jazz, World & Chamber Music., Rhythm & Blues, Traditional Jazz, Funk, Blues & Jazz, Fusion", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "FEW ENTERTAINERS have ever commanded such depth of artistry in every medium.

According to Nick Ashford of Ashford and Simpson, Dee Dee\u2019s rendition \"personified a generation and gave us all hope.\"\n\nAS A SPARKLING AMBASSADOR FOR JAZZ, she bathed in its music before she could walk. Her mother played the greatest albums of Ella Fitzgerald, whose artistry provided an inspiration for Dee Dee throughout her career. Her father was a trumpeter who taught music \u2013 to Booker Little, Charles Lloyd and George Coleman, among others. It is the kind of background that leaves its mark on an adolescent, especially one who appeared solo and with a trio as soon as she was able. Dee Dee\u2019s other vocation, that of globetrotter, reared its head when she toured the Soviet Union in 1969 with the University of Illinois Big Band. A year later, she followed her then husband, Cecil Bridgewater, to New York.\n\nDEE DEE MADE HER PHENOMENAL NEW YORK DEBUT in 1970 as the lead vocalist for the band led by Thad Jones and Mel Lewis, one of the premier jazz orchestras of the time. These New York years marked an early career in concerts and on recordings with such giants as Sonny Rollins, Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Max Roach and Roland Kirk, and rich experiences with Norman Connors, Stanley Clarke and Frank Foster\u2019s \"Loud Minority.\"\n\nDEE DEE DOESN\u2019T CARE MUCH FOR LABELS, and in 1974 she jumped at the chance to act and sing on Broadway where her voice, beauty and stage presence won her great success and a Tony Award for her role as Glinda the Good Witch in The Wiz. This began a long line of awards and accolades as well as opportunities to work in Tokyo, Los Angeles, Paris and in London where she garnered the coveted \u201cLaurence Olivier\u201d Award nomination as Best Actress for her tour de force portrayal of jazz legend Billie Holiday in Stephen Stahl\u2019s Lady Day. Performing the lead in equally demanding acting/singing roles as Sophisticated Ladies, Cosmopolitan Greetings, Black Ballad, Carmen Jazz and the musical Cabaret (the first black actress to star as Sally Bowles), she secured her reputation as a consummate entertainer.\n\nNAMED AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS\u2019 FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) in October 1999, Dee Dee joined the battle against world hunger. Appealing for international solidarity to finance global grass-roots projects, the FAO\u2019s Ambassadors aid in developing self-reliance in long-term conservation and management of sustainable agriculture, rural development and the conservation and management of natural resources.\n\nTAKING OVER THE REIGNS OF JAZZSET FROM THE ILLUSTRIOUS BRANFORD MARSALIS, Dee Dee continues to bring her message to listeners.

One set, six songs in just thirty minutes, changed my life forever.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve shared a tour bus with Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Famers, performed in front of crowds of over 20,000 people, and been lucky enough to share the stage with artists like Brandi Carlile, Heart, Gavin DeGraw, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, James Blunt, Edwin McCain, Chris Isaak, and Daughtry, as well as tour Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, performing for our men and women in uniform stationed overseas.\n\nMusic has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It\u2019s taken me to parts of the world I would\u2019ve never seen and connected me with lifelong friends I would\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s given my life purpose. Without music, I may have never met the two greatest loves of my life, my wife, Mandy, and my daughter, Annabelle Rose Baker. However, at the same time, music almost tore my life apart.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2013, I was touring over 200 days a year. By many standards, I was living the dream, but life on the road was taking its toll. While my music career had never been better, my personal life had never been worse. At home, waiting for me, was the life that I\u2019d dreamed of, and I was missing it. First words were being spoken, first steps taken, and it was all passing me by like road signs on the highway. Sadly, the two people I was working hardest to protect, were the ones getting hurt the most.\n\nThen one day I walked into an empty house and found my wife\u2019s wedding ring on the kitchen table along with a note that read, \u201cI will not be sorry for the choice YOU made.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, success as a singer-songwriter didn\u2019t seem nearly as important if it meant failing as a husband and as a father. I was at an intersection in my life and a choice had to be made. I could continue down the road I was on, whatever the cost, or change my direction and come home.\n\nThankfully, I made the choice to refocus on my family, and in January of 2014, I put down my guitar and started picking up the pieces. I stopped recording and touring, and traded the stage lights, for front porch lights, but as it turns out, the day that I decided to stop making music, was the day a new chapter in my music career began.\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that you get what you give in this life. 5 years ago, I GOT a second chance, and everything that\u2019s happened has GIVEN me this moment.\n\nToday, I am a better husband. I\u2019m a better father, and hopefully, I\u2019m a better songwriter. Music may have tried to tear my family apart, but now it\u2019s graciously bringing us back together. So, I see music as a celebration of every wrong turn and right turn that has led me here, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t give thanks for that old wooden box with six strings.\n\nHere\u2019s to the hope that keeps us holding on and to never losing sight of the things that are truly important. Here\u2019s to the promise and possibility of each NEW DAY. Here\u2019s to the beauty of the present moment and to trying our best to make the most of it. The road here has not been easy, but over the last few years, I\u2019ve learned that if you look hard enough, the shadows always show us the light.

His mother was the maid Maria do Carmo Nascimento. When he was just a few months old, the boy was adopted by the family for whom his mother had previously worked: the couple Josino Brito Campos (a banker, mathematics teacher and electronic technician) and L\u00edlia Silva Campos (a music teacher). He lived in the boroughs of Laranjeiras and Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro. When he was 18 months old, his biological mother died and he moved with his adoptive parents to the city of Tr\u00eas Pontas, in the State of Minas Gerais.\n\nIn the earlier stages of his career, Nascimento played in two samba groups, Evolussamba and Sambacana. In 1963 he moved to Belo Horizonte, and his friendship with the Borges brothers led to the Clube da Esquina (\"corner club\") movement. Other members included Beto Guedes, Toninho Horta, Wagner Tiso, and Flavio Venturini.\n\nNascimento is famous for his chime-clear falsetto and tonal range, as well for highly acclaimed songs such as \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o da Am\u00e9rica (Song from America)\" and \"Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Estudante (Student's Heart)\". The lyrics of \"Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Estudante\" remembers the funeral of the student Edson Lu\u00eds, killed by police officers in 1968. The song became the hymn for the diretas J\u00e1 campaign in 1984 and it was also played in the funeral of the late president Tancredo Neves the next year, who died before assuming the presidency.\n\nWhile his reputation within Brazil was firmly established with his Clube da Esquina works, Nascimento's international breakthrough came with his appearance on jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter's 1974 album Native Dancer. This led to widespread acclaim, and collaborations with American stars such as Paul Simon, James Taylor, and Pat Metheny.\n\nThrough his friendship with guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, Nascimento came to work with the pop-rock band Duran Duran in 1993. Nascimento co-wrote and performed (in the Portuguese language) the song \"Breath After Breath\", featured on the band's 1993 album Duran Duran. He also performed with the band in concert when they toured in Brazil, in support of that album.\n\nNascimento earned a Grammy award for \"Best World Music Album\" in 1998 for his album Nascimento, and was also nominated in 1991 and 1995.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Nascimento", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Alexis Morrast LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Shemekia Copeland LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8970332.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Soul, R&b, Blues", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Shemekia Copeland never holds back. Her instantly recognizable voice\u2014capable of being sultry, assertive and roaring\u2014delivers every song with unparalleled honesty and passion. Her wide-open vision of contemporary Americana roots and soul music showcases the evolution of a passionate artist with an up-to-the-minute musical and lyrical approach. With her new Alligator Records album, AMERICA'S CHILD, Copeland confidently announces an electrifying new chapter in her constantly evolving story. Produced by Americana Instrumentalist Of The Year winner Will Kimbrough (who also plays guitar on the album) and recorded in Nashville, AMERICA'S CHILD is a courageous and fiery statement of purpose, a major step forward for the singer whose musical consciousness continues to expand as her star continues to rise.\n\nAMERICA'S CHILD is by far Copeland\u2019s most compelling work yet, with music swelling beyond blues and into spirited Americana, with elements of rock, soul, and country. From AMERICA'S CHILD\u2019s anthemic opening track, Ain\u2019t Got Time For Hate, to the closing lullaby, the traditional Go To Sleepy Little Baby, Shemekia sings with passion and insight about the chaos and uncertainty in the world while still finding joy all around her.\n\nWith guests including John Prine, Rhiannon Giddens, Mary Gauthier, Emmylou Harris, Steve Cropper, J.D. Wilkes, Al Perkins and members of the Time Jumpers, AMERICA'S CHILD bursts with Copeland\u2019s bravado and embraces with her tenderness. Gauthier and songwriter/executive producer John Hahn wrote two striking songs for the project. Smoked Ham And Peaches is a search for truth and tranquility in America, featuring Giddens on African banjo. Americans celebrates our collective diversity in all its forms and colors. American music legend Prine joins Shemekia for a stirring duet on his own Great Rain. Guitar great Cropper adds his scorching playing to the ballad Promised Myself, written by Shemekia\u2019s father, the late bluesman Johnny Clyde Copeland. And her version of I\u2019m Not Like Everybody Else transforms the Kinks song into a blues-fueled declaration of independence.\n\nUpon the birth of her son Johnny Lee Copeland-Schultz in 2016, Shemekia, with fresh eyes, began to take an even deeper look at the state of the world. Of the new album, she says, \u201cAfter having a child, I started thinking about the world I brought him into, how it actually is and how I wished it was and all the things he will have to go through. And to live in this world today, you have to have a strong foundation like I did to make it through. So that\u2019s what 'AMERICA'S CHILD' means to me. I\u2019m truly grateful to all the artists that joined me on this record\u2014it wasn\u2019t about the genre for anyone, it was about the music and mutual love and respect.\u201d\n\nWhen Shemekia broke on the scene at age 18 in 1998 with her groundbreaking Alligator Records debut CD Turn The Heat Up, she instantly became a blues and R&B force to be reckoned with. News outlets from The New York Times to CNN praised Copeland\u2019s talent, larger-than-life personality, and true star power. With each subsequent release, Copeland\u2019s music has continued to grow. From her debut through 2005\u2019s The Soul Truth, Shemekia earned eight Blues Music Awards, a host of Living Blues Awards (including the prestigious 2010 Blues Artist Of The Year) and more accolades from fans, critics and fellow musicians. 2000\u2019s Wicked received a Grammy nomination. Two highly successful releases on Telarc (including 2012\u2019s Grammy-nominated 33 1/3) cemented her reputation as a singer who, according to NPR\u2019s All Things Considered, \u201cembodies the blues with her powerful vocal chops and fearless look at social issues.\u201d\n\nCopeland returned to Alligator Records in 2015 with the Grammy-nominated Outskirts Of Love. She won the 2017 Living Blues Readers\u2019 Award for Blues Artist Of The Year (Female), the same distinction she won the year before. She also took home the 2016 Blues Music Award (BMA) for Contemporary Blues Female Artist Of The Year. Outskirts Of Love won the BMA for Best Blues Album Of The Year. MOJO said Copeland was \u201cspectacular, stirring, sanctified and sassy.\u201d\n\nShemekia Copeland has performed thousands of gigs at clubs, festivals and concert halls all over the world and has appeared on national television, NPR, and in newspapers, films and magazines. She\u2019s sung with Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, Keith Richards, Carlos Santana, James Cotton and many others. She opened for The Rolling Stones and entertained U.S. troops in Iraq and Kuwait. Jeff Beck calls her \u201camazing.\u201d Santana says, \u201cShe\u2019s incandescent...a diamond.\u201d In 2012, she performed with B.B. King, Mick Jagger, Buddy Guy, Trombone Shorty, Gary Clark, Jr. and others at the White House for President and Mrs. Obama.\n\nNow, with AMERICA'S CHILD, Shemekia Copeland is standing on the cusp of her greatest success. Her intensely empowering, American music is as insightful as it is fun. NPR Music says, \u201cShe brings a perfect balance of authority and understatement to each song.\u201d No Depression adds, \u201cWhen Shemekia Copeland opens her mouth, everybody pays attention. She pierces your soul. This is how you do it, and nobody does it better than Shemekia Copeland.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://jazzfoundation.org/covid19fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Terra Guitarra LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10380108.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Neuvomenco, Instrumental Guitar", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The fourth Terra Guitarra CD Dragonyfly combines the fiery passion of neuvo flamenco guitar with visions of journeys, firelight and fiestas.

It's a fitting image for young Chicago guitar hero RONNIE BAKER BROOKS on his aptly titled third release, THE TORCH. Not only does he sing with soulful fire and play with a white-hot intensity; he's also carrying the torch from the previous generation of soul and blues greats and moving the music into the future.\n\nAs the 17 original songs on THE TORCH make clear, RBB is the right man for the job. Brooks grew up steeped in American music tradition yet his focus remains resolutely on the future. As well as anyone of his generation, he knows the transcendent release at the heart of soul, blues and rock. He knows because, as the son of blues great Lonnie Brooks, he came of age watching the fieriest guitar players and most soulful singers of a previous era express their deepest feelings through their music.\n\n\"I grew up among the best of the best,\" Brooks says. \"Every time I play, I feel like I've got to do it with the authenticity and passion that I saw in guys like Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters, B.B. King and my father. But I also have to put my twist on it. None of those guys repeated what came before them.\"\n\nBrooks' twist involves enlivening blues-rock with deep soul and modern hip-hop vocals and funk rhythms. Working with Minneapolis producer Jellybean Johnson, a veteran collaborator of Prince and Janet Jackson, Brooks takes roots sounds and transforms them into something that spans the ages.\n\n\"I like to think of how Muddy Waters took the Mississippi blues he heard in his youth and modernized it for his times by making it electric and harder,\" Brooks explains. \"That's what I'm trying to do for my generation. I want to take what's authentic and powerful about the music I grew up loving and bring in other influences without losing the heart and conviction of it.\"\n\nBrooks' personal touch also shines through in the concise, colorful songs for THE TORCH, all of which he wrote. He draws on the choppy, hip-shaking rhythms of funk, the emotional truth of soul and the forcefulness of rock to bring a distinctive dimension to his groundbreaking sound. Who else would, or could, record a song featuring classic Chicago artists Lonnie Brooks, Eddy Clearwater, Jimmy Johnson and the late Willie Kent with another highlighting rapper Al Kapone.\n\n\"I wanted to do something that would bring young people to the blues, and then give them the real hardcore thing at the same time,\" Brooks says. \"When I grew up, all my friends listened to rap and funk, and I listened to the blues. So I heard their music and they heard mine. I think we both saw some connection between them. I like that line in the movie \"Hustle & Flow\" when they say this new rap song ain't nothing but \"Backdoor Man\" written for modern streets. It's a hip-hop world right now, but I want to bring a little blues to the party.\"\n\nIndeed, Brooks' collaboration with Kapone on \"If It Don't Make Dollars, Then It Don't Make Sense\" shows a streetwise philosophy that could've fit in next to the Three Six Mafia on the \"Hustle & Flow\" soundtrack. On the other hand, Brooks sings like a Memphis soul king on the open-hearted \"Be a Good Man\" a pledge that he'll always try to live honorably and treat his woman with respect.\n\nElsewhere, Brooks shows off his funk chops on \"It's On\" suggesting he's learned a thing or two hanging out with the Prince crew in Minneapolis, while \"You Wrong For That Now\" features the kind of all-out guitar workout that draws on Texas toasters like Freddie King, Johnny Winter and Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n\nBrooks flexes his musical muscle at a time when he sees a new vitality being brought to the music through himself, Shemekia Copeland and Bernard Allison. He's convinced this music would be considered as relevant and as powerful as the latest hits by Kanye West or Beyonce Knowles if exposed to young listeners.\n\n\"You can see it in the success blues-influenced players like John Mayer and Jonny Lang have enjoyed,\" Brooks says. \"All they needed was to have their music heard, and people loved it. That's all it will take.\"\n\nBut for all of the varied influences on THE TORCH, the song Brooks is most proud of is \"The Torch of the Blues\", the tune that gave the album its title. The song features Brooks with his father and heroes Eddy Clearwater, Jimmy Johnson and the late Willie Kent, who worked on the session shortly before his death in March 2006.\n\n\"Being there with my dad, Eddy Clearwater, Jimmy Johnson and Willie Kent, all of whom I admire so much, that was a dream come true. We all played our butts off that day and had a blast.\"\n\nBrooks has earned his spot on the front lines. He spent a dozen years backing his father, watching how the master entertainer drew enthusiastic responses night after night. For years, the younger Brooks put his lessons on stage every night, opening his father's show to great response. With his father's blessing, he left the band to strike out on his own shortly after releasing his own debut album, Golddigger in 1998.\n\nLike his father before him, Brooks became a Chicago blues mainstay, playing regularly in Chicago area clubs. After the release of his second album, 2001's Take Me Witcha, he hit the road for what turned out to be a seemingly non-stop three-year tour, picking up devoted new fans all along the way.

The Georgia native has lived a life that truly reflects his art \u2013 troubled to some, enviable to many and yet remarkable to most anyone who hears the soft-spoken musician recount it.\n\nFowler admits that his diehard, all-or-nothing approach to life has sometimes been both a blessing and a curse. But lately, it\u2019s all been a blessing. That wasn\u2019t the case at the start of his musical journey.\n\nLiving a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll lifestyle eventually caused the artist to hit rock bottom. \u201cAt rock bottom,\u201d Jason says, \u201cThat's where I began recovering from a place of hopelessness.\u201d He adds, \u201cIt is also where I discovered that it was not God who left me, but I who left Him.\u201d He went from a rising star with a lucrative record contract, to being addicted and homeless on the streets of Atlanta, to finding redemption through Grace \u2013 and now he shares that story through his music.\n\nFowler grew up in a musical family and notes, \u201cMy dad sings like Pavarotti, my Uncle Mike taught me guitar, and my Uncle Chris has a doctorate in musical performance. Some of my earliest memories were at my granny\u2019s house, with everyone singing and dancing to \u201cPony Boy\u201d by The Allman Brothers Band.\n\nWhen Fowler was sixteen he heard a friend playing Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d on guitar. This sparked his musical fire and Jason bought his first guitar. Shortly after his dad offered him a new guitar if he learned to play \u201cJessica,\u201d also by The Allman Brothers Band.\n\n\u201cI think my dad was hoping I would give him a couple of weeks,\u201d Fowler smiles, \u201cbut I went and played it for him that night.\u201d\n\nFowler honed his talents for music and writing as a teen. By his twenties he was working on several projects and ultimately landed a record deal with his band Ultraphonic. They were produced by Bryan Holmes (The Producers) and, coincidentally, Johnny Sandlin, who produced The Allman Brothers Band, Widespread Panic and Wet Willie. Fowler and his band spent several months recording with the legendary \u201cSwampers\u201d at MS Sound in Muscle Shoals, Alabama \u2013 just like the song.\n\nThen the unthinkable happened\u2026\n\nThe record label was bought out by Microsoft and the album was shelved. What seemed to be the pinnacle of a life long-held dream, ended up a nightmare of epic proportions. After the breakup of the label, band, and dreams of stardom, Fowler landed a solo deal with Mil Cannon at Imagemil in Atlanta (Usher, Whitney Houston, Carrie Underwood). Fowler was given another chance. With expectations high, Fowler was on his way back, but still carrying his old hurts, habits, and hangups, fueled by drugs and alcohol. By this time Jason didn\u2019t know how to live a sober life, which affected his personal and professional relationships. His tenure at Imagemil didn\u2019t last very long. Mil and members of the Imagemil team confronted Fowler with the facts: he was out of control and needed help. They had to let him go.\n\nFowler was stubborn and his substance abuse issues did not go away quietly. Over time, he spiraled, ending up homeless and alone. After being kicked out of a drug dealer\u2019s house, Fowler finally waved the white flag of surrender.\n\nBroken, lost, and hopeless, Fowler entered a Christian-based rehab in Athens, Georgia, called The Healing Place. He stayed there for an entire year, but it was in that facility where the fog eventually lifted and Fowler rededicated his life to Jesus. \u201cIt\u2019s like a country song backwards,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI started getting things back in my life instead of losing them. I had lost, my relationship with God, my family, my friends, and myself.\u201d But this wasn\u2019t a sad ending. This was simply the end of his old life, and a new beginning of Fowler\u2019s career as a Christian artist, a worship leader and a speaker.\n\nFowler\u2019s debut solo album, Letters from the Inside (Black Cat Records, 2014), was produced by Jason Hoard (Third Day, Mac Powell, Jamie Grace, Natalie Grant). Musically it tells his journey back from homelessness, addiction, and hopelessness. It took almost five years for Fowler to clear his head and his musical passion to return.\n\n\u201cI was becoming more involved in church and in my recovery. I started feeling like my reason for being here is to praise God,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cBut I also needed to share my story of where I was, what happened, and what it\u2019s like today.\u201d\n\nThe songs from Letters from the Inside were snapshots of Fowler\u2019s journey and newfound faith. The ten songs were recorded in Griffin, Georgia over a period of two months. Fowler recruited long time friend and drummer Shane Evans, formerly of Collective Soul, as the backbone of the album and his touring band. The two began to share the message of hope and redemption, mostly to young people and up-and-coming musicians who were about to embark on their own journeys.\n\nI Fall In (Rcity Records, 2016) is Fowler\u2019s second album, which took Fowler on a sojourn to Nashville. It was there where he recorded at Dark Horse Studios with Grammy-nominated producer Billy Smiley (White Heart, Johnny Cash, Bebe and Cece Winans). Together they recruited a heavy-hitter list of talented artists for his sophomore effort, which included Leigh Nash (Sixpence None the Richer), Will Turpin (Collective Soul), Peter Furler (Newsboys), Steve Brewster (Chicago, Bob Seger, Amy Grant), Anthony Sallee (Michael W. Smith, White Heart), Jillian Edwards, Blair Masters (Casting Crowns, Garth Brooks, Mercy Me), and Jared Kneale (Kacey Musgrave, Ben Rector), and even his aunt, Joy Waters Fowler, to name just a few. The album also provided an opportunity for Fowler to mend his relationship with Imagemil founder Mil Cannon, who directed Fowler in three music videos.\n\nThe Nashville adventure also led to a professional collaboration with legendary vocalist John Schlitt (Petra, Head East) and Billy Smiley (Whiteheart) to form The Union of Sinners and Saints in 2016. They followed up their 12-song debut album with a nationwide tour of churches and venues, singing, sharing their testimonies and witnessing to fellow Christians about their fame, follies and fellowship.\n\nJason also shares his writing and performing talents with Will Turpin of Collective Soul on his latest release Serengeti Drivers (Gooey Records, 2018). The two collaborated on five songs and will tour the southeast behind the album, which took four years to complete.\n\nFowler is currently working with Dove winning and Grammy nominated producers Ian Eskelin and Barry Weeks (Francesca Battistelli, 7eventh Time Down), putting the final touches on his third solo album earmarked for an early 2019 release.\n\nIn between recording projects, Fowler tours the United States and Canada, sharing his story of rock, recovery and redemption.", "otherInfo": "Let\u2019s get together this Thursday, May 14th at 8:00pm EST for some music and fellowship!\nTune in at Facebook.com/JasonFowlerMusic."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sheryl Crow LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7560403.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "A nine-time GRAMMY AWARD recipient, Sheryl Crow is an American music icon.

It\u2019s a journey that has seen the country-rocker tour with superstars like Taylor Swift and Alan Jackson, play to over 50,000 people in Nashville at the world\u2019s biggest country music festival and build a large, devoted following as he\u2019s played the length and breadth of his native land and across the USA. Morgan has made his mark on the Australian musical landscape with a sound that fused contemporary country with melodic rock, fueled by a unique passion and energy all Morgan\u2019s own. His music is driven by an optimism shaped by life\u2019s bumpy journey, a faith in the power of love and hard work to overcome the obstacles we all face every day. Growing up in the working class beach city of Newcastle in NSW, Morgan turned the blue-collar ethic of his neighborhood into a relentless drive for energy and connection in his live shows. After seeing him whip a festival crowd into a frenzy, Warner Music Australia offered Morgan a recording contract. In 2013, after releasing two hit EPs that yielded three #1 singles, Morgan was named New Oz Artist of the Year at the CMC Music Awards. The fan voted award solidified his status as the hottest young performer in Australian country and was followed by four more trophies over the next two years, including back-to-back Male Oz Artist of the Year awards. Soon Morgan returned to Nashville to record his debut album with an all-star group of A-list musicians and Nashville based Aussie ex-pat producer Jedd Hughes. \u201cTo hear guys who played on the songs that inspired me to become a musician, playing on my songs, blew my mind,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cIt reminded me of why I was doing this in the first place and pushed me to take my vocals and guitar playing on the album to the next level\u201d. The songs that make up Morgan Evans are the result of a relentless songwriting schedule for almost a year that took Morgan to Nashville and back, and saw him tap into the deepest parts of himself. Morgan wrote eleven of the twelve tracks - some by himself, some with local artists and many with A-list Nashville writers. The album, released in March 2014, immediately shot to #1 on the iTunes and ARIA Country Album Charts and debuted at #20 on the ARIA Mainstream Album Chart. The impact of the acclaimed album has been immense \u2013 3 #1 singles (One Eye for an Eye, Best I Never Had and record-equaling Like A Tornado) and his first APRA nominations just for starters. The release also garnered international attention, leading to an invitation to return to Nashville\u2019s massive CMA Music Festival and perform at the legendary Grand Ole Opry, which prompted William Morris Endeavor \u2013 the world\u2019s largest talent agency \u2013 to sign Morgan up for international representation. Morgan\u2019s charisma and talent for engaging audiences led to his signing as the face of Foxtel\u2019s Country Music Channel, which has already seen him nominated for an ASTRA Award and a TV Week Logie Award \u2013 a first for an Australian country music star. He hosts television coverage of the CMC Rocks music festival, artist interviews and the CMC Music Awards. He was joined in 2016 by international co-host Kelsea Ballerini for the live national broadcast. A major career milestone was capped off when Morgan received a message from Grammy-winners Lady Antebellum informing him that he\u2019d been awarded the prestigious 2015 CMA Global Artist Award. The award recognizes outstanding achievement by an international country star in furthering the popularity of country music in their home country. Morgan joins an exceptional list of previous winners including Tommy Emmanuel, Kasey Chambers and Lee Kernaghan. Since then, Morgan has his sights set once again on Nashville, relocating to Music City where he has been writing with the A-list of songwriters for his upcoming US debut release and recently made return performances to CMA Music Fest and the Grand Ole Opry. His growing fanbase in both Australia and the USA is eagerly awaiting new music from Morgan, expected to be released later this year. http://www.morganevansmusic.com \"Kiss Somebody\" Out Now: https://wmna.sh/me_kisssomebod Twitter: @Morgan_Evans Instagram: @morganevansmusic Snapchat: themorganevans", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Andrew Sapin LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7261503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rock, Soul Rock, Pop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida; Andrew Sapin is a talented musician currently blazing his path in the field of Contemporary Pop and Soul.

He traveled to Texas for this project to record in The Panhandle House Studio enlisting the talents of JT Corenflos | Electric Guitar ( Alan Jackson, George Jones, Charley Pride, George Strait), Mitchell Smithey | Steele Guitar (Ray Price, Lee Ann Rimes, TG Sheppard, Gary Stuart), Dale Morris Jr. | Fiddle (Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Ray Price, Marty Stuart, Travis Tritt), Kerry Huckaba | Bass Guitar (The Hansons, The White River Band), Jay Brown | Piano (Canyon, Ty Herndon), and Andrew Raley | Drums (Deryl Dodd). Together, they captured a sound filled with fiddle, pedal steel and all the hallmarks of classic country music. Ten of the eleven tracks are penned by veteran writer Galen Griffin (Luke Bryan, Joe Diffie, Craig Morgan, Clay Walker) and magically Engineered and Produced by Nick \u201cAce\u201d Lutz (David Alan Coe, Ty Herndon, Little Texas, Ronnie Milsap, Kellie Pickler). This is an album filled with music intended to take the listener back to an earlier era in Country Music reminiscent of a simpler time. Owens shines brightly delivering each song with the same supersized voice that once shook the pews of his hometown church as the musicians expertly lay the sounds of Dance Halls long gone.\n\nLong before he hand-built his career in the honky-tonks and country clubs of the southeast, Owens grew up in rural Alabama. In many ways, it was a classic American upbringing, filled with family, faith, and music. Owens shines a light on those old-school values with his debut album Where I\u2019m Coming From and his newest release It\u2019s A Southern Thing, working closely with a roster of country music's top songwriters \u2014 including Bob Diperio, Greg Barnhill, Tony Stampley, Wynn Varble, Brian Callihan and Trent Willmon \u2014 for his most upbeat collection of songs to date.\n\n\"Like a lot of my favorite country singers, I grew up singing Gospel music,\" says Owens, who grew up listening to artists like Randy Travis and Keith Whitley. \"I grew up the same way, and I've stayed true to my Traditional Country roots. I'm still singing about going to church, eating fried chicken, and keeping it country. Why wouldn't I? Once you start trying to be something you're not, that's when you lose track of where you're headed.\"\n\nLongtime country music journalist Robert K. Oermann agrees, pointing to Owens' traditional approach as his strongest weapon. \"I like to think that there are cycles in [country] music,\" Oermann explains. \"Usually, the pendulum swings out and the Pop-Country people bring in a whole lot of new listeners, and then the new listeners discover real Country music. Then there's usually a swing back to more traditional styles. I hope we're on the cusp of that\u2026 and if we are, Shane is perfectly positioned.\"\nA self-made road warrior who was recently named \"Independent Artist of the Year\" by MusicRow Reveals 2018 Country Breakout Awards, Owens continues to maintain an active schedule of listening room and honky tonk shows along with festival appearances. He made his Grand Ole Opry debut in 2017. He also appeared at summertime events like CMA Music Festival and Jamboree In the Hills, both of which were voted as the top two American country music festivals of the year. Cracker Barrel has picked Owens' music to appear in several of the store's exclusive releases, including Country Faith America and Country Faith Love Songs, while Netflix included his song \"Country Never Goes Out of Style\" in the popular series The Ranch. No wonder Rolling Stone Country named Shane Owens one of the magazine's \"10 New Country Artists You Need to Know!\"\n\nNew music. New album. New shows. Shane Owens continues to more forward, but he also remains rooted in the sound that launched his career, breathing new life into a sound that's at once fresh and familiar. \"I've grown my business the old-school way,\" he explains. \"I played the honky-tonks for years. I developed myself and my sound. It can be tough when you've got a traditional sound, but I can't be anything I'm not. If it was easy to do, everybody would do it. And I'm nowhere near done doing it.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Fat Joe LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7303966.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rap, Hip-hop, Hip Hop", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Fat Joe (born Joseph Cartagena on August 19, 1970) is an American rapper.

The son of bassist and sousaphonist Walter Payton, he took up the trumpet at the age of four and by the time he was nine he was playing in The Young Tuxedo Brass Band alongside his father. Encouraged by Wynton Marsalis, who was himself involved in New Orleans' jazz and brass band music in his youth, Payton played semi-professionally throughout his grade school years and at the age of 12 played with the All star jazz band at festivals througout the United States and Europe. Upon leaving school he enrolled first at the New Orleans Centre for Creative Arts and then at the University of New Orleans, where he studied with Ellis Marsalis.\n\nAfter touring with Marcus Roberts and Elvin Jones in the early 90s Payton signed a recording contract with Verve; his first album, From This Moment, appeared in 1994.

The eleven songs on the record are drawn from the World War II anti-Fascist Italian partisans, the U.S. civil rights movement, and Mexican protest ballads, as well as original compositions, and feature a wide range of guest vocalists, including Tom Waits, Steve Earle, Meshell Ndegeocello, Justin Vivian Bond, Fay Victor, Sam Amidon, and Ohene Cornelius.\n\nRibot began working on the project at the end of 2016, responding not just to the American elections, but to the political trends he was seeing around the world. \u201cI am alarmed by Trump and the movement he\u2019s part of,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a good chunk of my life running around the world on tour\u2014I\u2019m kind of an accidental internationalist\u2014and I see that he\u2019s not an isolated phenomenon. And if we don\u2019t deal with what is going on, it is going to deal with us.\u201d\n\nOver a forty-year career, Ribot has released twenty-five albums under his own name and been a beacon of New York\u2019s downtown/experimental music scene, leading a series of bands including Los Cubanos Postizos and Ceramic Dog. Since his work with Tom Waits on 1985\u2019s Rain Dogs album, though, he is best known to the world as a sideman, playing on countless albums by the likes of Elvis Costello, John Mellencamp, Norah Jones, the Black Keys, and Robert Plant and Alison Krauss\u2019 Grammy-winning collaboration Raising Sand.\n\nAlong with his musical efforts, Ribot has also been an outspoken activist/community organizer in a number of causes, from affordable housing to musicians\u2019 rights in the digital age. During his time on the protest lines, he became aware of the diminishing role that music has played in recent years.\n\n\u201cI remember being at Occupy Wall Street early one morning because there was a report that the cops were going to come and break things up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a moment when people needed something to sing. They tried Tom Petty\u2019s \u2018I Won\u2019t Back Down,\u2019 but it didn\u2019t quite fit. It frustrated me that we had this rich history of songs for that occasion, but nobody knew them.\n\n\u201cOn this record, there\u2019s a song from the American civil rights movement that people traditionally sang when they were being arrested called \u2018[We Are] Soldiers in the Army.\u2019 Sound can travel into the paddy wagons and jail cells where people are isolated, and people in the civil rights movement needed that song to remind them that they\u2019re not alone. Songs can also remind us that we\u2019re not alone spiritually or historically: in fact, we have some pretty great company. But singing together is more than just gesture: it\u2019s a political act in itself: when people are willing to sing \u2018WE are soldiers in the army/[we have to fight/ we also have to cry]\u2019, that\u2019s half the battle right there.\u201d\n\nMost of the material for Songs of Resistance was chosen by March 2017; over the next eight months, singers were being matched with songs and tracks were recorded whenever and wherever possible. \u201cThough this record has some well-known people on it, it wasn\u2019t star-focused, says Ribot. \u201cI wanted to include people who felt a personal connection, who understood the project culturally and politically and were really involved in the process.\u201d\n\nOne critical participant was Waits\u2014with whom Ribot has frequently collaborated over the last three decades\u2014who sings \u201cBella Ciao (Goodbye Beautiful),\u201d an Italian partisan ballad. \u201cI played Tom a bunch of the tunes and he immediately bonded with that one,\u201d says Ribot. \u201cOf course, he brings a certain gravitas to everything he does\u2014my Italian friends say he sounds exactly like an old \u2018partigiano\u2019 (resistance fighter)!\u201d\n\nSteve Earle joins Ribot on one of the album\u2019s new compositions, which are largely based on texts the guitarist encountered as news stories or overheard conversation. \u201cSrinivas\u201d is a metered version of news articles on Srinivas Kuchibhotla, a Sikh immigrant murdered in February 2017 by a racist who mistook him for a Muslim. \u201cIn the original version,\u201d Ribot points out, \u201cI had named the guy who shot him, but Steve changed that\u2014he said, \u2018That guy is just some poor idiot, it\u2019s not about him, it\u2019s about the ones who set him up.\u2019 That kind of intelligence and wisdom coming from the artist was important to me.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way Steve Earle is going to be a sock puppet for anyone else\u2019s voice, and that\u2019s exactly the kind of situation I wanted. It\u2019s cool to have professional protest singers and all that, but I wanted to include artists who reached outside the \u2018protest\u2019 bubble.\u201d\n\nFor \u201cThe Militant Ecologist\u201d (based on another Italian anti-Fascist song called \u201cFischia Il Vento\u201d), Ribot turned to the magnificent singer/songwriter/bassist Meshell Ndegeocello. \u201cWe changed the gender in our version, and the flag at the end is green, not red. But Meshell projects the persona of a resistance fighter going on a mission perfectly: \u2018strong her heart, and swift her arm to strike.\u201d\n\nFor Marc Ribot, the creation of Songs of Resistance was not just an act of protest, but also a path to discovery. \u201cI went through a lot of self-examination,\u201d he says. \u201cI kept asking \u2018What gives us the right to perform this song or access this history or change this lyric?\u2019 Sometimes we had to change an arrangement, to add and build on the original, or change the context. The struggle to find out which songs to perform, how (and with who) to perform them\u2014to learn how we can live the musical ideas from our past NOW\u2014is ongoing, and it extends beyond music.\u201d\n\nAt a time of such overwhelming social turmoil, finding a focus for this kind of project is challenging. But Ribot\u2019s purpose remained clear. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of contradiction in doing any kind of political music,\u201d he says, \u201chow to act against something without becoming it, without resembling what you detest. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to figure out what to do, and I imagine we\u2019ll make mistakes, and hopefully, learn from them. But I knew this from the moment Donald Trump was elected: I\u2019m not going to play downtown scene Furtwangler to any orange-comb-over dictator wannabe. No way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen democracy is threatened, people who value it need to work together to defend it. When basic human rights are threatened by racists, sexists, and homophobes, we need to respond. I don\u2019t know what \u201cthe answer\u201d is: but I know this: If we\u2019re not able to work together, we\u2019re going to get our asses kicked separately.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://jazzfoundation.org/covid19fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Fur LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/audiotree"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Volk LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10106410.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Western And Country, Punk, Blues Rock & Soul, Western Soul Spaghetti, Soul, Punk Rock, Country, Western Indie Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Cowpunk for the People.\n\nFollow VOLK on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/2D45e9Z\n\nSubscribe to VOLK on Youtube:\n\nyoutube.com/livevolk\n\nInstagram: https://bit.ly/2WD39bz\n\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2D6fYVa\n\nlivevolk.com\n\n\"Nashville duo VOLK could get the gig of house band for a honky-tonk in hell with its gnarly blues riffs, deep grooves, ripping distortion and Patsy-Cline-On-Steroids brand of Country-Western meets Glam-Rock.\"\n\n- The Charlotte Observer\n\nLightning-charged duo VOLK is a Molotov cocktail of high-octane Rock & Roll and Honky-Tonking Country swagger.

The record received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of \u201cThe 50 Most Important Recordings Of The Decade\u201d by NPR.\n\nIn the ensuing years, CYHSY\u2019s Alec Ounsworth has continued pushing himself creatively, releasing three additional Clap Your Hands Say Yeah full-lengths and issuing two solo projects. The group has also grown a robust international fanbase: In 2015 alone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah toured in Latin and South America, Japan and Europe. All of these experiences have helped Ounsworth refine his vision for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as the group heads into its twelfth year and the release of its fifth album, The Tourist.\n\nLike previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah records, The Tourist nods to Ounsworth\u2019s musical heroes\u2014a group that includes artists such as John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Tom Waits and Nick Cave. However, this album also shows a natural progression from previous records. \u201cBetter Off\u201d and \u201cThe Vanity Of Trying\u201d are lush, keyboard-augmented songs, while \u201cA Chance To Cure\u201d and \u201cAmbulance Chaser\u201d are rhythmically askew, and the sighing \u201cLoose Ends\u201d is delicate, acoustic-based folk-rock.\n\nNo matter what the style, however, The Tourist\u2019s arrangements are laser-sharp and deliberate, without feeling labored-over. For example, \u201cDown (Is Where I Want To Be)\u201d combines piano flickers with anxious keyboards, gnarled electric guitars and teeth-baring drums\u2014but yet feels cohesive, not chaotic.\n\nThe Tourist emerged from a period where Ounsworth was doing a lot of intense soul-searching, and processing personal events that irrevocably shaped his life and future. But although most of these songs came together during this time of reflection, he considers the record to be cathartic\u2014an exhale of sorts, rather than a collection of songs where he was indulging in self-pity or letting things stagnate or fester.\n\n\u201cThe album was a type of purge,\u201d he says. \u201cA purge of certain emotional confusion that manifested itself in the last several years. It was not an easy album to make, by virtue of the fact that it was an emotional time for me.\u201d\n\nAppropriately, The Tourist\u2019s lyrics reflect how complex upheaval can be (\u201cWe can beat around this bush together/Sometimes it\u2019s all I think of/Other times I can forget\u201d) and explore the imperfect nature of blame (\u201cThe car left the road and was found without its mirrors/You play the victim/And I\u2019ll play the blind man\u201d). Other songs try to make sense of the present time (\u201cNow that the past is on fire/How can I look around and find I can\u2019t remember who I was\u201d) or employ clever wordplay\u2014 \u201cBlack cat let\u2019s not split hairs/I\u2019m tethered to the weather/I assure I don\u2019t care about no lucky streak\u201d\u2014for effect.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experiment with packing lyrics,\u201d Ounsworth says. \u201cOn this album, the lyrics and vocal melody effectively carry the songs, maybe more than anything else. Elvis Costello does this really well on his song \u2018Beyond Belief,\u2019 as does Paul Simon on his solo albums. I wanted not to overdo it lyrically, but do try to squeeze as much as I could out of certain phrases.\u201d\n\nOunsworth spent about a week recording The Tourist at Dr. Dog\u2019s Philadelphia-based studio with a drummer and bassist. After that, he and engineer Nick Krill spent a few months \u201ctidying things up\u201d and recording additional embellishments: backup vocals, keyboards, guitars and more percussion. That gives The Tourist more of a band feel than the last album, and contributes to why the record possesses a musical lightness. The dreamy opening track \u201cThe Pilot\u201d especially has a lilting edge, courtesy of Smiths-reminiscent acoustic guitars strums and Ounsworth\u2019s hiccupping, conspiratorial vocals.\n\nThe Tourist was then mixed by Dave Fridmann, who also worked on two previous Clap Your Hands Say Yeah albums, 2007\u2019s Some Loud Thunder and 2014\u2019s Only Run. Ounsworth says he and Fridmann are on the same musical wavelength, which makes their long-time working relationship an anchor of sorts. \u201cDave and I don\u2019t necessarily stick with what\u2019s easiest which is fine and anxiety-inducing, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cHe challenges me to do something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nHaving that space and freedom to explore as part of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is crucial to Ounsworth and a vital part of the band\u2019s identity. As anyone who\u2019s seen him perform a living room show will attest, this mindset also often results in songs with dramatically different arrangements. But as a musician and leader of an independent project, Ounsworth prides himself on honesty across all aspects of the band, from live performances to the studio.\n\n\u201cI am a relatively solitary person and seem to work best alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI do count on others to help the project as the process of making and releasing an album moves forward, but if it doesn\u2019t match what I have in mind, it\u2019s hard for me to really be there for it. I guess this is one reason why the project has been independent all this time. Trust me, I understand that thinking this way is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nHowever, this stubborn independence also reflects Ounsworth\u2019s commitment to musical integrity. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u2019s career arc is all about building on previous successes while staying true to a core artistic vision. And although The Tourist may have emerged from challenging times, it reflects Ounsworth\u2019s uncanny ability to move forward, no matter what the circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say that it was a dark time, but it was a difficult time in my life\u2014among the most difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I needed and need to try to let it go. And this is how I let things go. Though it\u2019s the same for any album\u2014this one probably more than the others.\n\n\u201cBut I have to try to do something each time that\u2019s new and engaging for me,\u201d he adds. \u201cI mean, I could very well just write songs the way they were early on. But I don\u2019t think that people would appreciate listening to someone just going through the motions. We have to build something to last, rather than just build it because it looks good at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Annie Zeleski", "otherInfo": "donate:\nhttps://www.paypal.me/Ounsworth"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Odesza LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9030970.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Electronic, Chillwave", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "ODESZA returns with its long-anticipated third album, a body of work filled with longing, nostalgia, hope and unity. Titled A Moment Apart, these 16 tracks mark the next step in the evolution of production duo Harrison Mills and Clayton Knight, who have been making music together since their college days at Western Washington University.\n\nThey began their meteoric journey in 2012 with Summer\u2019s Gone, an album they completed near the end of their tenure at Western. It was followed by 2014\u2019s In Return, which debuted at the top of Billboard\u2019s Dance/Electronic charts and featured gold single \u201cSay My Name.\u201d A remix of the track by RAC was later nominated for a Grammy in 2016.\n\nIn the course of that five-year span, they\u2019ve gone from ground zero to selling out large arenas, all without the benefit of mainstream press or radio airplay. They\u2019ve built their appeal through word of mouth and streaming, plus a unique live presentation featuring an 11-piece ensemble that includes a horn section and a marching-band drumline.\n\nA Moment Apart moves into expanded sonic and psychic territory, seamlessly balancing organic and layered synthetic sounds, creating a dreamy, often stirring hybrid that owes as much to Motown and \u201860s surf music as it does to electronic forebears such as Four Tet, M83, Gorillaz and Bonobo.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the duo\u2019s uncanny technical acumen at manipulating sounds that has landed ODESZA in the upper stratum of electronic music. Their immense impact stems from the emotions they elicit from their captured and constructed sounds: the powerful synths, the dynamic chord progressions that open into sweeping cinematic soundscapes and shimmering sonics, punctuated by ecstatic, thumping percussion.\n\nMills and Knight have always been leaders in the revolution of indie electronic music, encompassing a wider, more melodic musical palette and incorporating their own instrumental expertise \u2013 Harrison and Clay play piano, and Clay also plays guitar. On the new album they take their eclecticism one step further, using a stellar range of singers, including Regina Spektor, Leon Bridges, and RY X.\n\nAlso prominent is the exquisite symmetry they\u2019re able to fashion through an unexpected harmony of diverse parts.\n\n\u201cI think our greatest strength is in blending genres,\u201d says Mills, \"be it soul, folk, film scores or electronic\u2026I also think we\u2019re really good at finding sounds that shouldn\u2019t work together and making them fit. I like taking a voice or maybe an instrument, chopping them up into small pieces until they're almost unrecognizable, and mostly incoherent, and then layering them over each other to create a unique tone and sound. It allows us to take pieces from many different styles of music and meld them together to create something that is our own.\u201d\n\nSymmetry and balance is equally important for Knight, who has a degree in physics and math and never planned on pursuing a career in music.\n\n\u201cI was planning on going to grad school for computational finance. What connects that with what I do now always goes back to the idea of symmetry,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen a song is really well done, everything fits. It\u2019s all complementary. Having symmetry in sound is very pleasing to someone\u2019s subconscious. They don\u2019t know why they like it, but they like it. There\u2019s not a specific formula that you can follow, but there are patterns that you can see. Classic tracks that people love have certain distinctive patterns that can be seen across all forms of music. We\u2019re always trying to see what sounds create certain emotive responses.\u201d\n\nMills adds, \u201cWhat I really like about what we do is that we evoke this sense of nostalgia. Nostalgia to me is like instant emotion. I might hear something and think \u2018this reminds me of my childhood.\u2019 Or \u2018this one reminds me of that road trip.\u2019 A lot of times, if we\u2019re making a piano line, we think of something like, \u2018How can we get that warmth of an old soul record?\u2019 Sometimes I think it\u2019s building almost false memories for people. Almost tricking people into thinking that something seems familiar but it really isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe memories this time out often spring from the Northwest, a place where both ODESZA members have lived since childhood.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re known for making happy music,\u201d says Knight. \u201cAlthough Harrison is always trying to slip dark stuff into our music. This time he succeeded. Our album isn\u2019t sad \u2026 \u201d\n\n\u201cBut it sees the beauty in those moments\u201d says Mills.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most Northwest album we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d continues Mills. \u201cIt plays to the more overcast days than any of our other music has before. I don\u2019t like pointing out the dark elements without pointing out that the darkness is a positive thing too. That\u2019s the whole point of this album \u2014 and I hate this phrase \u2014 seeing the beauty in the darkness. It\u2019s finding that sad songs can make you really happy. Everyone\u2019s felt sad at some point. I think sometimes we ignore those feelings, and I think part of growing up and getting perspective is being able to see that those things are what life is about, and to appreciate those things even if they are painful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there is a lot of longing on this album,\u201d adds Mills. \u201cEspecially \u2018Everything At Your Feet\u2019 which is about a breakup and missing someone and wearing your heart on your sleeve. But all the tracks have an element of longing in them. \u2018Just A Memory,\u2019 with Regina Spektor, certainly. While \u2018Falls\u2019 is about feeling the kinship and community, and realizing that feeling bad about something is actually okay.\u201d\n\nAlternatively pensive, introspective, thoughtful, and triumphant, but ultimately jubilantly anthemic, A Moment Apart nudges listeners through a gamut of the self-discoveries that can only occur when you takes a moment to step outside yourself and look in.\n\n\u201cWe decided to call the album A Moment Apart since it has those darker overtones we hadn\u2019t used before. We were trying to think what represents the time you grow the most, and to me you grow the most in a moment away from all the noise,\u201d explains Mills. \u201cWhen you have a moment to reflect is when you form your strongest opinions and effect your greatest changes and growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the name and the album itself are not so much about isolation as the internal energy, something that happens from within when you step back from everything,\u201d adds Knight.\n\nWhich is something the two of them did after touring relentlessly for the past four years, with few breaks.\n\n\u201cI think about it like being at a party and walking outside and looking out at the moon. That\u2019s a beautiful moment and one you experience by yourself,\u201d adds Mills.\n\n\u201cI remember when we first started out, my goal was to make music I felt like I could dance to and play in my car and still wear my headphones and have a personal experience with,\u201d he continues. \u201cSomething you can put on at a party with your friends, and everyone enjoys it, but also have a very intimate approach with it. That hasn\u2019t changed for me in the past five years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to us to try to evoke emotion, not decide what it is. If they hate it, they hate it. If they love it, then they love it.\n\nKnight and Mills, who write continually, finished the ominous yet euphoric \u201cLine Of Sight\u201d while they were in Australia in April 2016. But the real work on the album began when they got home to Seattle toward the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe really buckled down for the next six or seven months in the ODESZA /Foreign Family Collective studio during the longest, darkest winter I\u2019ve ever experienced in Washington,\u201d says Knight.\n\nBut despite the bleakness of the weather, A Moment Apart is airy and triumphant, filled with possibility and a sense of infectious hope, and an interesting and overweening symmetry.\n\n\u201cWe finished \u2018Intro\u2019 and \u2018Corners Of The Earth\u2019 first, and decided they would be the album\u2019s first and last song,\u201d begins Mills.\n\n\u201cThose two songs embodied what we were hoping the album would turn out to be,\u201d Knight finishes, as is often the case with these two.\n\nThe album represents a well-considered step forward for ODESZA. \u201cOur first album was about discovering our sound,\u201d Mills says. \u201cThe second one was us trying to do something new with it and becoming more songwriters than instrumentalists, and this one was understanding what we do and trying to push it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s ODESZA\u2019s most ambitious album, yet also their most human one, despite the futuristic found sounds and cinematic sweeps and flourishes. Their goals for the album are sonically grand yet surprisingly modest.\n\n\u201cThe album\u2019s really about coming full circle and finding balance in both the sadness and the beauty. But mostly, we just want people to feel something when they listen,\u201d says Mills. \u201cIt\u2019s emotive music.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe album\u2019s about perspective, and it\u2019s about changing your perspective and not looking at something just at surface level. If there\u2019s a theme of the album, that\u2019s it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Lolla From the Vault Livestream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm9fDqfKArM"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sarah Siskind LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10357594.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rock, Americana, Fusion", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Sarah Siskind built her music career in Nashville, TN and now lives in her home-state of North Carolina.

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol.\n\nTo create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d\n\nThe new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic.\n\nG. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone.\n\nThis wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem.\n\nAlthough \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d\n\nWhether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game.\n\nHe certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d\n\nLove Saves The Day marks G. Love\u2019s sixth with Brushfire Records and he\u2019s thrilled with their relationship. He lauds label chief Emmett Malloy as someone driven by creativity first and whose aesthetic tastes he trusts. G. Love views today\u2019s music world as the Wild West, with \u201call the lines washed away;\u201d however, his genre-blurring music now is more relevant than when he started. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be doing what we are doing,\u201d he asserts, noting Gary Clark Jr., Jack White, Robert Randolph and Galactic as some fellow keepers of the blues flame who \u201cmaintain the roots but push music forward.\u201d\n\nG. Love proudly describes himself as a road dog who \u201cwill be touring until I fall off the earth\u201d and plans to keep on pushing with Special Sauce from stage to stage.

His musical style ranges from classical to pop.\n\nAfter only one year in the music department at Carnegie Mellon University, his choice school, Groban left when he was offered a recording contract at Warner Bros. Records through David Foster's own 143 Records imprint. With regard to signing Groban, Foster said: \"I love his natural ability in the pop and rock arena, but I love his sense of classics even more. He's a true musical force to be reckoned with\" [5]. Therefore, under Foster's influence, Groban's first album focused more on the classics with songs such as \"Gira Con Me\" and \"Alle Luce Del Sole,\" the first ones decided on by Foster and Groban.\n\nSoon after being picked up by David Foster, Groban went on to perform \"There For Me\" with Sarah Brightman on her 2000-2001 La Luna Tour, featured on her \"La Luna\" Concert DVD, and made his recording debut by singing \"For Always\" with Lara Fabian on the movie soundtrack to A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001). He also became involved in many benefit shows, including the following: \"The Andre Agassi Grand Slam Event For Children\", singing alongside Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Don Henley and Robin Williams; \"Muhammad Ali's Fight Night Foundation\" which honored Michael J. Fox and others; \"The Family Celebration\" (2001) which was co-hosted by President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and David E. Kelley and his wife, Michelle Pfeiffer; and Michael Milken's CapCure event, which raises funds for cancer research.\n\nIn May 2001, Groban played the role of Malcolm Wyatt in the season finale of the television series Ally McBeal, performing \"You're Still You.\" The series creator David E. Kelley was impressed at Groban's performance at The Family Celebration event, and, based on the audience reaction to Groban's singing, Kelley created a character for Josh in this finale. The character of Malcolm Wyatt was so popular, with 8,000 emails from fans, that Groban was asked to come back the next season to reprise his role and perform \"To Where You Are.\"\n\nOn November 20, 2001, Groban's self-titled debut album Josh Groban was released and, over the next year, it went from gold to double-platinum.\n\nOn February 24, 2002, Groban performed \"The Prayer\" with Charlotte Church at the closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympics, and by November, he had his own PBS special Josh Groban In Concert (2002). The following month, he performed \"To Where You Are\" and \"The Prayer\" at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, and joined The Corrs, Ronan Keating, Sting, Lionel Richie and others for a holiday performance at the Vatican in Rome, Italy.\n\nOn November 11, 2003, his second album Closer was released. Josh himself said that he believed that this second album was a better reflection of him and that his audience would be able to get a better idea of him personally from listening to it. \"What most people know about me, they know through my music. This time, I've tried to open that door as wide as possible. These songs are a giant step closer to who I really am and what my music is all about. Hence the title\".\n\nTwo months after Closer was released, it rose on the Billboard charts from number 11 to number one. Both of Groban's albums were produced by David Foster, released under Foster's 143 Records and distributed by Warner Music. His cover of Secret Garden's \"You Raise Me Up\" became very popular on the adult contemporary charts.\n\nJosh also performed in the soundtrack to Troy, composed by James Horner, featured in the song \"Remember Me\" with Tanja Tzarovsk. He also performed in the soundtrack to Robert Zemeckis's 2004 animated film The Polar Express, featured in the song \"Believe.\" The song is composed by Alan Silvestri and Glen Ballard.\n\nDuring the summer of 2004, Josh once again returned to the birthplace of his artistic growth, Interlochen, where he gave a legendary performance to local residents of Michigan and the many, many campers, ranging from elementary school to high school age. He additionally signed many autographs, and spoke about his experiences as a young performer.\n\nOn November 30, 2004, his second live DVD, Live At The Greek, was released. It also ran as a Great Performances special on PBS. Also in 2004, Josh performed \"Remember When It Rained,\" backed by a full orchestra, at the American Music Awards where he was up for Favorite Male Artist in the pop category. Josh and his recordings were nominated for more than a dozen awards in 2004, including the American Music Award, World Music Award, Academy Award, and a Grammy.\n\nOther appearances include The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jay Leno, Larry King Live, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, 20/20, The Today Show, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Super Bowl XXXVIII, and the Rockefeller Tree Lighting.\n\nDuring the first week of September 2006, Groban's latest single entitled \"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\", was exclusively released to AOL's First Listen. On November 7, 2006, Josh released his third studio album, \"Awake.\" He is kicking off his 2007-2008 tour on February 17th in Verona, New York.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/joshgroban"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Eve & The Exiles LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8440811.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Blues, Rock N Roll", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Blues grooves, Texas roots and trashy garage", "otherInfo": "Eve Monsees & Mike Buck play every Thursday evening as part of their Live In Exile series!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Rick Brantley LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8397987.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Rock N Roll, Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "So, what to make of this Rick Brantley? This seeker of the life-changing novel and the perfect pair of beat-to-hell boots; this connoisseur of the cool classic movie and the greasiest dive-bar cheeseburger, disciple of the museum\u2019s masterpiece and the panhandler\u2019s wiliest street-pitch? This guy who lives it, loves it, takes it all in and pours out something so tight and right you just gotta hear it again and again? Well, let\u2019s just tell it straight: Rick Brantley is a singer-songwriter who can seriously, seriously write and sing; a rocker who can really, truly rock. A young man worth listening to. Rick Brantley was born and raised in the musical mecca of Macon, Georgia, a preacher\u2019s son, soaking up the strains of gospel music, fire-and-brimstone sermons and the echoes of musical legends: Blind Willie McTell, Otis Redding, The Allman Brothers. \u201cMy Dad dug the local heroes, and was big on pop/rock hitmakers of the 70\u2019s, too, like Three Dog Night. We had a little home recording studio; music was such a part of everything\u201d, Rick says. He was also inspired by singer-songwriters like Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel. \u201cYou learn from those guys and they lead you to Kristofferson, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt,\u201d he adds. Brantley learned his lessons well: barely out of high school, his own songs and red-hot band performances led to a publishing contract and new home base in Nashville. Since then, his songs have been covered by artists ranging from Meat Loaf to country crooner David Nail, while he\u2019s continued honing his stage chops as both full-tilt rock-show frontman and acoustic solo performer, opening for acts as diverse as John Hiatt, Zac Brown Band, Better Than Ezra, and Steve Earle. It\u2019s the rock side that takes the wheel for Brantley\u2019s newest EP, Hi-Fi. The six-track musical meal leans into the wind, pairing his rock howl with hope and harmonica. Beginning with \u201cFine So Fine,\u201d Hi-Fi emits a warm optimistic glow \u2013 maybe, together, we\u2019ll all be okay. It\u2019s a sentiment that\u2019s echoed throughout the record: \u201cLittle Bit More\u201d is a love call to arms, while \u201cHoles\u201d sheds sunshine on imperfections. There\u2019s something vaguely familiar about Hi-Fi, a warm orange gospel that evokes bench seats and warm steering wheels and settles snugly between nostalgia for the glory days and joy at the potential of tomorrow. Then there\u2019s \u201cHurt People.\u201d The song, which leads the EP as a single, digs deep into the gritty, sometimes uncomfortable place born of knowing someone well. It\u2019s a testament to Brantley\u2019s ever-present need to understand the world around him: he\u2019s an acute listener, and he\u2019ll tell you that getting to know people at the merch table is his favorite part of every show. In \u201cHurt People,\u201d that richness comes to life, honed in the stark depth of forgiveness by way of understanding. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone that, like [Hi-Fi producer and co-writer Mark Selby], is such a method actor,\u201d says Tia Sillers, the award-winning songwriter who co-wrote five of the six songs on Hi-Fi. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to write a song about a person, we have to go back to birth. We have to know this person\u2019s second aunt, we have to know what happened to them in fourth grade, and we have to deliberate these things.\u201d \u201cOf course all of that can\u2019t be in the song, because it\u2019s a short form\u201d Selby adds, \u201cbut the back story of these people are all there in their minds, they\u2019ve been worked out.\u201d Listening to Hi-Fi, you may just feel like a bit of your story was woven in too. So back to our original question: what to make of this talented Rick Brantley? If enough of us hear him, see him, watch him own another stage. . . well, we might just make him a household name.

Lockwood Porter's Communion in the Ashes is a rallying cry for the hopeless and heartbroken, its lyrics set to a soundtrack of anthemic heartland rock & roll. This is a record that addresses our modern-day social problems from a perspective of hope, encouraging those who listen to focus on activism and community-building rather than despair. Along the way, Porter delivers some of the most engaging, electrifying songs of his career, rooting these melodic calls-to-action in the stomp and epic swagger of a five-piece road band.\n\nBorn into a working-class family in rural Oklahoma, Porter launched his songwriting career after relocating to the San Francisco Bay Area, kicking things off with 2013's Judah's Gone. There, in the nation's most expensive real-estate market, he also taught classes to underprivileged students at an inner-city school, a job that gave him a close-up view of the nation\u2019s growing class divide and its many symptoms, including poverty, gentrification, and homelessness. As his cross-country touring increased, so did the presence of political and social issues within his music, with 2016's How to Dream Again taking influence from the socially-conscious works of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. After writing 2019's Communion in the Ashes, Porter returned to Oklahoma with the goal of contributing to a growing artistic community and, hopefully, affecting social change.\n\n\u201cThe tech boom of the last 10 years has totally transformed the whole Bay Area, and has essentially made it a playground for the rich. Working-class folks and artists aren't welcome there anymore, and this has manifested in rising housing costs, closure of music venues, and the proliferation of homeless tent cities,\u201d Porter divulges. \u201cIn the last verse of the title track, I can see in hindsight that I was saying a \u2018goodbye\u2019 to the Bay Area, even though I didn't know that I'd be leaving at the time.\u201d\n\nWith Communion In The Ashes, Porter crystallizes a sound that is uniquely his own: one that gatecrashes the borders between indie rock & roll, singer/songwriter folk, and Americana. Written alone on the acoustic guitar and recorded with Porter's band during a collaborative, five-day studio session in Chico, CA, the album champions togetherness as an antidote to the immense problems we face as a society. On the kinetic title track, a kick drum bangs out a steady pulse while Porter unveils his game plan: \"When the bridges are all burned, let's congregate the masses, let's hold a new communion in the ashes.\" The song doesn't turn a blind eye to the desperation of today's world; instead, it builds something new from the rubble, transforming desolation into hope. A similar feeling imbues the piano-propelled \"I Will Do No More A-Prayin\u2019,\" a secular hymn that nods to Porter's childhood days in the Southern Baptist church. If \"I Will Do No More A-Prayin\u2019\" evokes the solemnity of Sunday morning, though, the bulk of Communion in the Ashes rustles up the thrill of Saturday night. There are furiously strummed power chords, pounding percussion, vocal harmonies, and 80s-inspired synthesizers, shot through with a voice that's urgent, compelling, and quick to incite. These are songs about revolution and rebuilding, and Porter sings them accordingly, his voice echoing and rattling its way between the electric guitars and upright piano.\n\nGiven the album's communal emphasis, it's appropriate that Communion in the Ashes is also Porter's most collaborative release. All five band members contributed to the arrangement process, with drummer Peter Labberton pulling triple-duty as the album's engineer and mixer. The band worked swiftly, foregoing rehearsal in favor of instinctual performances and quick studio decisions. \"Get Back to the Wild,\" the one song not recorded live, gave the band a chance to experiment, building a two-bar drum and piano loop into a spiritually-minded song that examines the distance between human nature and human society. Porter and company looked to their own influences for cues, too, with Communion's touchstones running the gamut from Leonard Cohen\u2019s inventive songwriting and Tom Petty's concise melodies to Wilco's experimentation and War on Drugs' gorgeously textured tones. Even so, this is the most distinctive release in M. Lockwood Porter's catalog \u2014 an album that both nods to the past and pushes forward to the future, thanks in part to a full-band attack that lends fire, ferocity, and grit to the tracklist.\n\n\u201cI think the fully collaborative recording process was the biggest musical shift between recording How To Dream Again and Communion In The Ashes,\u201d explains Porter. \u201cJeremy Lyon has been playing in my live band since 2016, but this was the first M. Lockwood Porter album that he\u2019s worked on, and he brought a much wider palette of guitar tones to this album than I've used on past records. This is also the first time I\u2019ve recorded with synthesizers. I had given the band the vague direction that I wanted us to imagine ourselves as a \u2018dystopian gospel band\u2019 before we started recording, and my keyboardist Jeff Hashfield found a sound on his Prophet synthesizer that we ended up dubbing the \u2018Blade Runner church organ.\u2019 We ended up using it on nearly every song.\u201d\n\nThroughout Communion In The Ashes, Porter\u2019s electrifying \u201cdystopian gospel band\u201d explores how frightening our world can be. The record\u2019s enthralling cover art \u2014 designed by William Schaff, known for his longtime association with Songs: Ohia's Jason Molina \u2014 shines a light on that horrifying present, depicting a man (A preacher? An organizer? A demagogue?) addressing a crowd from the foreground of a burning, decaying city. With its Springsteen-sized catharsis, though, Communion in the Ashes offers listeners something new: a soundtrack with which to rise up, rebuild, and renew. Call it protest music if you'd like. Call it a political album if you must.

Gros mixes all the sounds of New Orleans - funk, trad jazz, brass band, blues - and makes it his own signature gumbo. His new solo album Central City, shows Gros capturing New Orleans\u2019 distinct feel-good charm with help from some of its\u2019 most renowned players.\n\nGros began playing gigs when he was just fifteen years old but didn\u2019t truly kick off his career until after graduating from Loyola in 1989 with a degree in French Horn performance. During the seminal years that followed, the young man cut his teeth as a solo performer on Bourbon Street while also developing a reputation as a formidable sideman. He backed up some of the biggest names in the Crescent City,: such as Meters bassist George Porter Jr. and guitarist Snooks Eaglin. Studying under mentors decades his senior, Gros absorbed a lifetime of lessons in only a few years and quickly became part of the direct lineage of New Orleans music.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2013, Gros began his transition into the spotlight by leading Papa Grows Funk, a highly revered group that mixed hard-hitting funk grooves with often unpredictable jazz spontaneity. The band released six critically-acclaimed studio albums, including Needle in the Groove, which was co-produced by New Orleans legend and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Allen Toussaint. The group\u2019s weekly gigs at the world-famous Maple Leaf became a staple for both locals and tourists alike, eventually leading to Gros touring in far off countries like Japan and Brazil.\n\nHurricane Katrina\u2019s devastation in 2005 caused Gros to reanalyze his role in the world.\n\n\u201cBefore Katrina, I was simply a New Orleans musician, but after Katrina, I told my story of what New Orleans meant to me and why it is culturally significant to the world. It was at that point I became a New Orleans cultural ambassador, who happens to be a loudmouth, piano-playing, singer-songwriter.\u201d\n\nAfter Papa Grows Funk dissolved, Gros briefly returned to sideman work, playing organ for a series of all-star tributes to Dr. John and the Neville Brothers. The 2014 Dr. John tribute, The Music Mojo of Dr. John, was later released as a critically-acclaimed live album that featured Gros playing with Bruce Springsteen, Mavis Staples, Jason Isbell, and John Fogerty. More importantly for Gros, those tribute concerts allowed him to play alongside his two biggest influences: the Doctor and Art Neville, both of whom passed in 2019.\n\nIn 2016, Gros returned to the spotlight yet again with his second solo album River\u2019s On Fire, the much anticipated follow up to his 2004 debut Day\u2019s End. Co-produced by Gros and Tracy Freeman (Harry Connick Jr, Rebirth Brass Band, Bonerama), the album\u2019s fiery funk rock showed how Gros had matured as both a songwriter and bandleader. It firmly established Gros\u2019 identity as a solo force.\n\nNow, Gros is preparing to release Central City, his third solo album. The album is a collection of classic New Orleans songs, both new and old, filtered through his decades of dedication to his craft. The album features Gros\u2019 feel good originals alongside his takes on beloved songs by Allen Toussaint, Lloyd Price, and John Prine. Joining Gros on the album are a who\u2019s who in the keepers of the New Orleans tradition, including singer Ivan Neville (Dumpstaphunk), drummer Herlin Riley (Wynton Marsalis), banjoist Don Vappie, guitarist Brian Stoltz (Neville Brothers), trumpeter Mark Braud (Harry Connick Jr.), trombonist Mark Mullins (Bonerama), clarinetist Tim Laughlin, and his former boss George Porter Jr. (Meters). Together, they perfectly exploit the similarities between New Orleans jazz and early rock 'n' roll on songs such as \"Yeah Yeah Yeah\" and \"Personality.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m walking in the same path [as Dr. John, Allen Toussaint, and Art Neville,]\u201d explains Gros. \u201cI\u2019ve been following them my whole life.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town.

Lamar Blvd., Austin, TX. The band recently headlined The Beaumont Blues and Jazz Festival , and backed the legendary Barbara Lynn on her hits such as 'You'll Loose a Good Thing' and 'I'm A Good Woman'. A true honor for Lisa with her deep love and passion for the women of early Soul/R&B and Blues.\n\nThe band's live performance is an ever evolving sound of folk/funk, garage R&B jam, and improv, taking the songs and the audience on a unique journey every performance.\n\u201cThe cocktail that is her music (a funky, soulful blues) can\u2019t really be called fusion, but more a stirred Motown mixer. Lisa Marshall is on the fast track of positioning herself as one Austin\u2019s staple female artists.\u201d -Steven Blythe, Austin Post\n\nLisa moved to Austin in Spring of 2009 and begin playing such rooms as Continental Club, Saxon Pub, and Antone\u2019s, having the opportunity to share stages with Lavelle White, Barbara Lynn, Doyle Bramhall, W.C. Clark, Patrice Pike and Sister 7, Carolyn Wonderland, Malford Milligan, Bill Carter and more.\n\nShe hails most recently from Seattle. There she performed solo with, \u201cThe Blonde\u201d, her semi-hollow body electric guitar, and was often joined by the raucous, three part call-and-answer trio, The Dirty Girls! She released her first solo CD titled \u2018Simple\u2019 in May of 2008. The group was invited to the famous Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, TN. as the feature for The Sunday \u2018Songwriter\u2019s Spotlight\u2019. \u2018Simple\u2018 can be heard in regular rotation on KOOP, KAZI ;Austin, TX., WWOZ; New Orleans, LA. and various radio in Europe as well as making it on to 2 Top 5 Euro-Americana Charts.\n\".. her (LisaMarshall) voice belts and soars through the building lyrics then dips to a restrained contralto for climatic lines. Hints of reverb in the production space add a subtle, creepy effect to the gospel tunes. It could almost be too crafted, but with Marshall's spellbinding voice pulling at the tempo, the album feels so organic that you can't imagine it any other way.\"- Rachel Dovey, Seattle Sound Magazine\nMarshall's debut solo album 'Simple' was a one woman project with Lisa recording, mixing and playing every instrument on the album except Track 1 & 3; Scotty X on Bass, Track 6; E. Pruitt on Bass, Track 3 & 4; Eric Manegold on Drums, Track 2 & 5; Kevin Fallon on Lead Guitar, Track 5; Nick Salzetti on Drums. The title track Simple drums were recorded with a single sennheiser dynamic microphone placed in the middle of the drum set above the kick drum.\n\nBorn and raised in Virginia Beach, VA, she spent her early years on the Chesapeake Bay. Her young parents possessed a large vinyl collection; Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, Motown, Funk to Disco, was a constant in the house. Lisa remembers hours of sitting on the sand filled carpet with the album insert of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young 4 Way Street, reading the lyrics and singing along to 'Cowgirl In The Sand' with her younger sister. \"I have always loved harmonies. I loved that album for their harmonies. Looking back it's so fitting that I would sing that song. Living literally across the street from the beach our carpet sounded like a giant bean bag when you walked on it. I guess I thought I was the cowgirl.\" (laughs)...more like a gypsy\"\n\nAt the age of 21, Marshall moved to California. It was in L.A. where she co-founded and fronted Peculiar Boogie with Rebekah Coltman (guitar) & Susan Joyner (keys) for a decade. Their band was a unique blend of female fronted \u201cBrit\u201d Rock featuring R&B style vocals and harmonies. The band played and showcased at some of L.A\u2019s hot spots such as Troubadour, and the Roxy. Robben Ford, Koko Taylor, and Big Brother and the Holding Company are some of the acts that Peculiar Boogie supported. The band received air play in California and Europe regularly. Lisa also had the honor of singing with Big Brother and the Holding Company.\n\nCurrently Lisa had been debuting new songs with her band live around Austin. She continues to create new music for an upcoming EP to be released in 2016. Lisa has been selected from over 900 musicians in Austin to the list of Black Fret/Patrons of Live Music. Her love affair with early Soul/Funk/R&B continues as she honors the broad scope of the delicious sounds.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sayla Dobro ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8423806.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Pop, Rock, Alternative", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Enigmatic doesn\u2019t even begin to describe Sayla Dobro\u2019s presence. Consisting of guitarist and vocalist Todd Tate alongside drummer Daniel Guaqueta, Sayla Dobro was brewed up in the Bay Area, between Marin and San Francisco. Originally created as a stage name for Tate\u2019s persona in a now defunct Marin bar-hopping band, \"The Deep Sounds of Bobby Peru\", Sayla Dobro has since evolved into a much more complex and mature getup.\n\nThe band really kicked off after Tate saw dobro guitar virtuoso Jerry Douglas play live - he instantly went out and bought a dobro guitar and starting writing and recording immediately. Now part of his namesake, Sayla Dobro is characterized by Tate\u2019s customized Regal RD-35 square neck dobro. Enter Colombian-raised, Mississippi-born multi-instrumentalist Daniel Guaqueta. The drummer and Tate came together through mutual friend Michael Starita, President of the San Francisco area Grammy chapter. Starita mixed the first two Sayla Dobro singles, \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cJ-Train\u201d. During this time, he introduced Guaqueta and Tate and the rest was history.\n\nSayla Dobro\u2019s songs hearken seasoned folk-rockers like Beck and Calexico, thoughtfully self-produced and rough around the edges. It\u2019s no surprise that Sayla Dobro has been able to capture such a potent essence - the band\u2019s frontman and lead songwriter Todd Tate\u2019s industry experience runs deep. In the mid-nineties Tate\u2019s main focus was audio engineering at The Blue Room Studios, working on Grammy nominated Latin jazz with Carlos \u201cPatato\u201d Sanchez, and with popular rock artists like Train. On the brink of the millennium, Tate ditched full-time engineering and went to the other side of the glass to focus on making his own music. He made a rock record with a new group Life Love Misery (members of The Starship and Cacophony).\n\nMeanwhile, Guaqueta has a rich musical background of his own. He\u2019s written and released music with artists including Questions in Dialect, Buddy & The Squids, Mainframe Theory, and Storage 24. He\u2019s collaborated directly with Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (of Mutemath) and Mississippi rapper Kamikaze. His diverse background runs further; Guaqueta\u2019s visual artwork has earned honors for his music videos, including the Telly Award, the Addy Award, and the Ruma Award at Crossroads Film Festival.\n\nWith plans to release singles and videos \"very often\" in the upcoming months of 2016, Sayla Dobro is ready to hit the ground running. Supporters of the band\u2019s efforts to release a new single every month can download the band\u2019s single's as they are released in any format now at sayladobro.com/music or any online digital music service.

He has his black-belt in voice and bottleneck guitar and his banjo playing scares the crap out of me.\u201d\n\u2013 David Lindley, musical adventurer\n\nVery few musicians of any stripe so personify a musical genre as completely as Tony Furtado embodies Americana roots music. Tony is an evocative and soulful singer, a wide-ranging songwriter and a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist adept on banjo, cello-banjo, slide guitar and baritone ukulele who mixes and matches sounds and styles with the flair of a master chef (he\u2019s also an accomplished sculptor, but that\u2019s another story). All of the music of America is in Tony\u2019s music. Relix hit the nail on the head when writing of Tony: \u201cTrue talent doesn\u2019t need categories.\u201d\n\nA native of Pleasanton, California, who now makes his home in Portland, Oregon, Tony Furtado took up the banjo at age 12, inspired by the Beverly Hillbillies TV show and a sixth grade music report. He first attracted national attention in 1987, when he won the National Bluegrass Banjo Championship in Winfield, Kansas. Not long after that, Tony opted for the life of a full-time professional musician, joining Laurie Lewis & Grant Street. A second victory at Winfield, in 1991, bookended his years with Grant Street.\n\nIn 1990, Tony signed a recording deal with Rounder Records, one of the country\u2019s preeminent independent record companies. Beginning with Swamped in 1990, he recorded six critically acclaimed albums for the label, collaborating with such master musicians as Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Tim O\u2019Brien, Stuart Duncan, Kelly Joe Phelps and Mike Marshall. During this period, Tony also performed and recorded with the band Sugarbeat and the Rounder Banjo Extravaganza with Tony Trischka and Tom Adams.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s\u2014influenced by such musical heroes as Ry Cooder, David Lindley and Taj Mahal\u2014Tony added slide guitar, singing and songwriting to his musical toolbox and began leading his own band. He is a tireless road musician who performs in a dizzying variety of formats: solo, in a duo or trio or with his full five-person band. He especially values the opportunities he has had to tour with such legendary musicians as Gregg Allman and with such esteemed slide guitarists as David Lindley, Derek Trucks and Sonny Landreth.\n\nTony has performed throughout the world at top venues and appeared at such prestigious music festivals as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Jazz Aspen, Kerrville Folk Festival, Strawberry Music Festival, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival and countless others. \u201cI love playing live,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my energy is focused on the love of playing music and rolling with the moment. It\u2019s a give and take from the audience to the stage, and back. And the music that is created is something that otherwise might not occur without that flow.\u201d\n\nTony has recorded and produced almost a dozen CDs for various labels such as Dualtone, What Are Records and Funzalo Records. Tony enthusiastically describes his newest CD, The Bell, as \u201cthe most personal of my career.\u201d To be released this summer on his own YousayFurtado Records, The Bell is an important release for several reasons: it represents a return to Tony\u2019s banjo-playing roots, with the banjo and cello-banjo more prominent than in recent years; the original songs concern such weighty themes as the loss of his father, the birth of his son and his own creative rebirth with the move to a new record label and management team; his working band is featured; and, most important of all, this is the first album in a long time on which Tony had complete artistic control.

While this uncanny ability to reach back into time and bring new music forth can sometimes result in anachronisms, Heyer has done something truly amazing on his first solo album. On Sweet Action Heyer has found his home. He is rarely assisted on the album\u2019s eight tracks, but left alone with his own imagination Heyer\u2019s classic rock dream has come true. There isn\u2019t a weak track on the album, and Heyer\u2019s voice is stronger than ever. Sweet Action opens with the delicious mid century ring of vibraphone and roiling snare. Heyer quickly establishes a psychedelic feel\u2013somewhere between Bowie\u2018s Space Oddity and Floyd\u2018s Dark Side\u2013 and the album is instantly established as an orchestra you\u2019re allowed to play loud. The psych-rock freak out, one of Heyer\u2019s trademarks, comes faithfully on the next track. With that out of the way he breaks into a honky-tonk in the style of Lovin Spoonful\u2018s \u201cNashville Cats\u201d called \u201cHideaway.\u201d Stumbling on a rock record like this is like meeting an old friend, then realizing what it is about them you missed. The songs continue to fall out of Heyer just so, building a brick-and-mortar solid album without weakness. \u201cSong for the Top of the Mountain\u201d is as epic as its title suggests: triumphant guitar escalates up an epic track to the sound of marching drums. \u201cGhostly Glow\u201d is perhaps the album\u2019s best song, like an \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d that trades acoustic arpeggio for damn depressing cello, and lays down some supernatural allegory about perspective. Heyer\u2019s nimble mastery over the guitar can be experienced in full on \u201cThe Letter.\u201d Perfect strums trade bars with scale runs in a song so strikingly beautiful you almost don\u2019t notice how good his singing is.

She manages to be both imperial yet vulnerable.\u201d\n\nKaren had to know how to get the best from every instrument, every singer. To do so, she called upon the music she loved as a young girl \u2013 Soul. Blues and Gospel. In the crowded Andrews family home in Koonawarra, a young Karen listened to her brother\u2019s Motown records and the satin voice of Stevie Wonder. Singing along to those golden hits, and traditional Polynesian songs, was merely part of everyday family life; This would become the foundation of her original style \u2013 Oceanic Blues.\n\nOceanic Blues is the newest sub-genre of the Blues. Oceania\u2019s narrative tradition and the introduction of American Blues, Soul and Gospel since the 1960s, has shaped this distinctive style. The roots of the sound are gritty guitar, glowing valves, lush tremolo and deep reverb in a distinctively fluid Oceanic expression. This sound carries the mood and tones of Oceania expressed in rich, warm vocal tones.\n\nKaren Lee Andrews debuts her new sound and EP \u201cFar from Paradise\u201d. This EP mines the vibrant blues and soul at the heart of her musical heritage.\n\nAndrews mostly tours as a formidable trio, teaming up with Yanya Boston on drums and Adam Ventura on bass \u2013 two exceptional musicians.

Symphonic compositions flow from her fingertips effortlessly, with sound ranging from transcendental folk-pop to virtuosic instrumentals. Christie is often described as \u2018Michael Hedges meets Joni Mitchell and Dave Matthews,\u201d integrating melodic pop lyricism with catchy hooks and percussive, harmonic textures. As an Official Showcase Artist at Folk Alliance International consistently logging a number of major festivals, events, opera houses and theaters nationwide, Christie Len\u00e9e performs with radiant joy that awes crowds and inspires fellow musicians. She recently told Digital Journal that \"years ago, I set my intention to be an inspirational songwriter, though over time I've come to realize that inspiration comes in many forms. Talking about the dark and the light, the beauty and moments of pain are all forms of inspiration.\"\n\nChristie has shared stages with Tommy Emmanuel, Tim Reynolds (Dave Matthews Band), Andy McKee, and Amy Ray (Indigo Girls) to name a few, who have all raved about her talents (see below). Her first place victory in the acclaimed 2017 International Fingerstyle Guitar Championship has earned her featured coverage in Guitar Player Magazine, Acoustic Guitar Magazine, and Premier Guitar. She has released five albums, with \u201cSTAY\u201d one of three finalists for \u201cBest CD of 2016\u201d (Indie Acoustic Project Awards). The album includes three instrumentals produced by Grammy Award Winning producer Will Ackerman, founder of Windham Hill Records, and a music video for the title track supporting a movement on suicide prevention.\n\nChristie\u2019s live shows present a menu of percussive and sonic effects, larger than life sounding instruments, her solo shows embody layers of orchestral elements with a wide array of dynamics and harmonic textures. In 2018 Christie released an arrangement of Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d which garnered media attention across several Digital Publications. AXS.com's Jim Wood noted \"through the use of harmonics and tapping, Len\u00e9e's infectious style utilizes all parts of the guitar and combines elements of folk, rock and pop into one tasty and eclectic musical stew.\"\n\nWith over 12,000 fans on Facebook and nearly half a million plays on YouTube, Christie continues to spread the love of music through live performance, radio airplay and appearances on multiple television stations. Her most recent music video \"Call My Heart Back Home\" premiered via Acoustic Guitar Magazine. Her next video, \u201cFree World Citizen\u201d, is an anthem expressing the connection of all beings. As an artist, she hopes to bring joy, freedom, and light to the world though the love of music.\n\n\u201cChristie Len\u00e9e is a wonderful spirit making beautiful music on the guitar. She has epic compositions that take one on a journey through time.\u201d\n~ Tim Reynolds, Guitarist for Dave Matthews Band\n\n\"\u2026 One of the most shockingly moving interludes we\u2019ve ever had. It was more than the fluid, neck-tapping virtuosity.

It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label. Two Tomatoes moved into a real office in New York City, with real staff including Shannon Chirone, John Waldman (Great Knight Productions), Corinne Barlow, Katie Messer, Michelle Puskas, Justice Longshore, and publicist Elizabeth Waldman Frazier.\n\nIt's one big happy family!", "otherInfo": "Laurie Berkner is doing daily Facebook lives during the COVID-19 school and community closures.

Very rarely though, do we see this happen in a live environment.\n\nSince 2005, John Rotellini has captivated audiences around the world by doing the impossible. A childhood love for magic paired with an eclectic collection of interests led John to develop what has become an obsession. By merging sleight of hand magic and illusions with other disciplines - psychology, con artistry, film, music and theatre, John has created live, interactive events that more closely resemble Hollywood blockbusters rather than traditional magic shows. No longer is the world of the impossible limited to the silver screen.\n\nJohn now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada where he can be found performing select dates in some of the Strip's most critically acclaimed productions and entertaining some of today's hottest stars when not on his own U.S. Tours.\n\nWhether it be performing live in front of thousands, entertaining small groups or executing death-defying large scale stunts, John's performances will be sure to leave you speechless. After all, how often do you get to live the impossible?\n\n\nHistory:\n\nWhen it comes to his shows, John has a very unique way of thinking. Rather than using a traditional audience/performer relationship, John has developed interactive experiences where the audience become the stars of the show. This allows each show to be different than the last and makes for many off-the-cuff and unique moments between John and his volunteers.\n\nAfter several years of honing his craft and performing for people in his home state of Wyoming, John launched his first headlining tour, Locked UP in April of 2009. The show, which opened to sold out crowds included a very special stunt. The spectacle, Rotellini's first venture into stunt work, was entitled -B L I N D- and required John to spend a day without sight, wrapping up with a blind drive through the streets of his hometown in a 2009 Pontiac Solstice roadster.\n\nThree years later, in January of 2012, the show transitioned from it's original Locked UP format into the TOURPOCALYPSE brand. The show, a blend of high-octane illusions punctuated with close up effects, celebrity cameos and what can only be called \"special\" theatrical moments, entertained crowds across the U.S. and led to John's first full-length DVD - John Rotellini: TOURPOCALYPSE Live From The Gryphon Theatre.\n\nFrom late 2011 until early 2013 John spent most of his time on the road. After his critically-acclaimed tour wrapped its run during the middle of 2013, John began developing an all-new show - AGENT PROVOCATOUR which began in 2015 and is currently touring the United States.\n\nOn April 19, 2016, John became the first magician to perform at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, NV. John joined the Harlem Globetrotters (who were also completing another first for the arena - its first athletic event) to create some very special magic for their 90th Anniversary World Tour.\n\nCurrently, John keeps very busy, raising thousands of dollars for charities that include Kidd's Kids, Children's Miracle Network, Win-Win Entertainment, The USO and Relay for Life while traveling the country entertaining audiences at various colleges, public and private events to rave reviews. He has been fortunate enough to gain sponsorship from Countryman Microphones, American Crew Men's Products and has had the privilege of having EXPRESS Fashion be the official wardrobe provider for some of his tours.", "otherInfo": "Special Win-Win Entertainment Virtual Visit and performance for patients, staff and visiting families of AdventHealth For Children in Orlando, FL"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Katie Kittermaster ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8840965.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Acoustic, Country, Pop", "Time": "3:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Katie Kittermaster is a British singer/songwriter.

There isn\u2019t a weak track on the album, and Heyer\u2019s voice is stronger than ever. Sweet Action opens with the delicious mid century ring of vibraphone and roiling snare. Heyer quickly establishes a psychedelic feel\u2013somewhere between Bowie\u2018s Space Oddity and Floyd\u2018s Dark Side\u2013 and the album is instantly established as an orchestra you\u2019re allowed to play loud.

The songs continue to fall out of Heyer just so, building a brick-and-mortar solid album without weakness. \u201cSong for the Top of the Mountain\u201d is as epic as its title suggests: triumphant guitar escalates up an epic track to the sound of marching drums. \u201cGhostly Glow\u201d is perhaps the album\u2019s best song, like an \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d that trades acoustic arpeggio for damn depressing cello, and lays down some supernatural allegory about perspective. Heyer\u2019s nimble mastery over the guitar can be experienced in full on \u201cThe Letter.\u201d Perfect strums trade bars with scale runs in a song so strikingly beautiful you almost don\u2019t notice how good his singing is.

Cameron Adams, from the Herald Sun, says, \u201cMs Andrews has one of those authentic sounds you hear.

To do so, she called upon the music she loved as a young girl \u2013 Soul. Blues and Gospel. In the crowded Andrews family home in Koonawarra, a young Karen listened to her brother\u2019s Motown records and the satin voice of Stevie Wonder. Singing along to those golden hits, and traditional Polynesian songs, was merely part of everyday family life; This would become the foundation of her original style \u2013 Oceanic Blues.\n\nOceanic Blues is the newest sub-genre of the Blues. Oceania\u2019s narrative tradition and the introduction of American Blues, Soul and Gospel since the 1960s, has shaped this distinctive style. The roots of the sound are gritty guitar, glowing valves, lush tremolo and deep reverb in a distinctively fluid Oceanic expression. This sound carries the mood and tones of Oceania expressed in rich, warm vocal tones.\n\nKaren Lee Andrews debuts her new sound and EP \u201cFar from Paradise\u201d. This EP mines the vibrant blues and soul at the heart of her musical heritage.\n\nAndrews mostly tours as a formidable trio, teaming up with Yanya Boston on drums and Adam Ventura on bass \u2013 two exceptional musicians.

Their dynamite live performances, which mixed tireless house beats with jazz instrumental interludes, earned the attention of a swelling house and electronic music fan base. As their fame grew, so did their scope, scouring obscure sources for unique and cheeky samples that they twisted into endlessly fun hooks and choruses. Stirring African rhythms and melodies into the mix helped GoldFish evolve a uniquely South African house sound. Their burnished grooves are rooted in pure pop pleasure, invoking consequence-free dance explosions (without next-day regret). And a consistent string of chart-topping hits\u2014and festival appearances as far flung as Miami and Ibiza\u2014has helped GoldFish become one of the most influential groups in global electronic music.\n\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/essentialgoldfish\nMerchandise: http://www.goldfishlive.com/merch\nFor gig info, click the EVENTS tab.\nInternational bookings: bookings@goldfishlive.com\nSouth African Bookings: info@goldfishlive.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Laurie Berkner Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8451562.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Laurie Berkner - lead vocals, guitar; Susie Lampert - keyboardpiano, vocals; Brady Rymer - bass, vocals; Bobby Golden - percussion and drums", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"The Queen of Children's Music\" - People Magazine\n\nWhen Laurie Berkner embarked on her career as a children's recording artist in the summer of 1997, she started small - personally filling orders of her first release (Whaddaya Think of That?) from her living room in Manhattan while still keeping up her preschool music teaching jobs. It wasn't long, however, before the 500 copies she originally pressed sold out, and Two Tomatoes Records was born.\n\nLaurie's growing popularity in the New York area led to a second release, 1998's Buzz Buzz. Soon more local toy stores and children's specialty shops began selling her music and distribution companies began purchasing quantities of her recordings. Shortly after the 1999 release of Victor Vito, Laurie took the bold step of hiring a publicist, Sarah Geist Rosen (SKG Publicity). Things began to move more quickly thereafter, with national media coverage helping spread the word. Laurie then appeared on the \"Today\" show and suddenly Two Tomatoes was swamped with orders.\n\nIn the meantime, Laurie's closets were becoming more and more stuffed. Two Tomatoes was taking over her living room with the 2000 re-release of her first recording on disc, and running the record label was no longer a part-time job. Laurie decided to give up her teaching to, as she put it, \"reign in the monster!\" In 2002, shortly before the release of Under A Shady Tree, it became clear that there was no longer enough space in Laurie and husband Brian's one-bedroom apartment for a record label. Two Tomatoes moved into a real office in New York City, with real staff including Shannon Chirone, John Waldman (Great Knight Productions), Corinne Barlow, Katie Messer, Michelle Puskas, Justice Longshore, and publicist Elizabeth Waldman Frazier.\n\nIt's one big happy family!", "otherInfo": "Laurie Berkner is doing daily Facebook lives during the COVID-19 school and community closures.

Very rarely though, do we see this happen in a live environment.\n\nSince 2005, John Rotellini has captivated audiences around the world by doing the impossible. A childhood love for magic paired with an eclectic collection of interests led John to develop what has become an obsession. By merging sleight of hand magic and illusions with other disciplines - psychology, con artistry, film, music and theatre, John has created live, interactive events that more closely resemble Hollywood blockbusters rather than traditional magic shows. No longer is the world of the impossible limited to the silver screen.\n\nJohn now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada where he can be found performing select dates in some of the Strip's most critically acclaimed productions and entertaining some of today's hottest stars when not on his own U.S. Tours.\n\nWhether it be performing live in front of thousands, entertaining small groups or executing death-defying large scale stunts, John's performances will be sure to leave you speechless. After all, how often do you get to live the impossible?\n\n\nHistory:\n\nWhen it comes to his shows, John has a very unique way of thinking. Rather than using a traditional audience/performer relationship, John has developed interactive experiences where the audience become the stars of the show. This allows each show to be different than the last and makes for many off-the-cuff and unique moments between John and his volunteers.\n\nAfter several years of honing his craft and performing for people in his home state of Wyoming, John launched his first headlining tour, Locked UP in April of 2009. The show, which opened to sold out crowds included a very special stunt. The spectacle, Rotellini's first venture into stunt work, was entitled -B L I N D- and required John to spend a day without sight, wrapping up with a blind drive through the streets of his hometown in a 2009 Pontiac Solstice roadster.\n\nThree years later, in January of 2012, the show transitioned from it's original Locked UP format into the TOURPOCALYPSE brand. The show, a blend of high-octane illusions punctuated with close up effects, celebrity cameos and what can only be called \"special\" theatrical moments, entertained crowds across the U.S. and led to John's first full-length DVD - John Rotellini: TOURPOCALYPSE Live From The Gryphon Theatre.\n\nFrom late 2011 until early 2013 John spent most of his time on the road. After his critically-acclaimed tour wrapped its run during the middle of 2013, John began developing an all-new show - AGENT PROVOCATOUR which began in 2015 and is currently touring the United States.\n\nOn April 19, 2016, John became the first magician to perform at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, NV. John joined the Harlem Globetrotters (who were also completing another first for the arena - its first athletic event) to create some very special magic for their 90th Anniversary World Tour.\n\nCurrently, John keeps very busy, raising thousands of dollars for charities that include Kidd's Kids, Children's Miracle Network, Win-Win Entertainment, The USO and Relay for Life while traveling the country entertaining audiences at various colleges, public and private events to rave reviews. He has been fortunate enough to gain sponsorship from Countryman Microphones, American Crew Men's Products and has had the privilege of having EXPRESS Fashion be the official wardrobe provider for some of his tours.", "otherInfo": "Special Win-Win Entertainment Virtual Visit and performance for patients, staff and visiting families of AdventHealth For Children in Orlando, FL"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Katie Kittermaster ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8840965.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Acoustic, Country, Pop", "Time": "3:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Katie Kittermaster is a British singer/songwriter.

She has opened for Eli Matthson (America's Got Talent) and Emi Meyer at the National Cherry Blossom Festival, has played Celebrate Fairfax (headliners included Joan Jett, Blues Traveler, and Ok Go), opened for Theresa Andersson, a Swedish musician featured in 'Rolling Stone', at DC9, and played with Rosi Golan at Bloombars. Flo heads the local chapter of Just Plain Folks, an international music networking organization and has performed and sold out of her debut cd in venues across New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.\n\nThe last two years have proven to be a whirlwind for Flo. She shot a music video for her song Uh Oh which won the Grand Prize on OurStage.com! The same song was one of 5 finalists in a Cosmo Radio contest, winning her an interview and airplay on Sirius Radio. After a live audition, she was selected for the 2010 Artist Roster at the world renowned Strathmore Music Hall and invited to play the mansion in 2012. Flo was the only DC based musician selected to play Merriweather Post Pavilion as part of the Virgin Mobile Free Fest's Busking Brigade, where she joined an impressive bill: Weezer, Blink 182, the Bravery, and Franz Ferdinand. She was selected for a CMJ showcase in NYC, a GAP campaign in Charlottesville, and a feature video on the website for the National Association of Broadcasting. She has played for the Secretary of the Interior, performed at the National Press Club, and sung the National Anthem at a Washington Freedom game.\n\nFlo's new album, \"No Dustbunnies\", recorded with Chris Keup (O.A.R., Erin McKeown), Stewart Meyers (Lifehouse), and Brian Jones (Dave Matthews Band, Mandy Moore), has been a best seller on both CDbaby and Digstation and is getting radio play in NY, CT, and the DC metro area.

His work includes lead singer and creative force behind The Bible, formed in the 1980s, and reformed in 1994, as well as solo recordings and work for film. He lives in Ely.\n\nHewerdine (born Mark Hewerdine) moved to Cambridge as a child, but returned to London in his late teens, and worked in a record shop. Suffering from agoraphobia, it was not a happy time of his life, and he was fired from his job after being wrongly accused of theft. Returning to Cambridge, he teamed up with a friend with similar experiences and started to write songs. They formed the short-lived Placebo Thing, later renamed The Great Divide. They were heard by Mike Scott of The Waterboys, who recommended them to Ensign Records, where they cut two commercially unsuccessful singles. In 1985 Hewerdine, working once again in a record shop in Cambridge, formed The Bible, recruiting jazz drummer Tony Shepherd. They released an album of songs through the independent Norwich label Backs Records called Walking The Ghost Back Home.\n\nThe Bible became a fairly successful independent band, with a cult following spread mostly through word of mouth and live performances. Two tracks from the first album, Graceland and Mahalia were released as singles, but did not achieve very significant sales. The album however was very well received by music pundits, and this brought the band to the attention of Chrysalis Records. Signing to Chrysalis, Graceland and another track, Honey Be Good were (re)released as singles, and reached the lower end of the UK singles chart. A new album, Eureka followed, but failed commercially. In 1988, Hewerdine decided to leave the group and pursue solo projects. Calum MacColl and Neill MacColl from the group went on to form Liberty Horses.\n\nAt around this time Hewerdine met US \"new country\" singer Darden Smith, and this set him off in a new direction. Working together, he and Smith released a collaborative album, Evidence. Hewerdine also worked simultaneously on new solo songs, largely based on his earlier traumatic experiences in London. Eventually these were distilled down to produce the Ignorance album, released in 1992. Invited by Tori Amos to play support promoting these songs, Hewerdine managed to find a new audience and Ignorance and a single from the album, History, did relatively well commercially.\n\nAs Hewerdine's star rose, he started to write for other artists, among them Eddi Reader, Clive Gregson and Christine Collister. The Bible reformed for a tour in 1994. Further solo album releases followed, such as 1996's Baptist Hospital and 1999's Thanksgiving. Meanwhile Hewerdine was asked by long-time friend Nick Hornby to contribute music to the soundtrack for the movie version of his book High Fidelity, whose subject (working in a record shop) was also very close to Hewerdine's experiences.\n\nHewerdine continues to write and perform his own songs. Harmonograph, released on MVine/Red Grape Records in February 2006, is a collection of his songs written for other artists such as Eddi Reader and Hepburn, recorded by Hewerdine for the first time. 2008 saw two mini CD releases - Toy Box 1 and Toy Box 2 with art work by Hewerdine's partner.

Over the last couple of years, the man originally turned on to the dance by Derrick Carter has fomented his own groove driven, emotive brand of house that now resonates around the world. Turning heads right from the off were his compilations on Deep Down and Defected, which found Sonny adding his remix flair to a bunch of classics, and after that came sophomore effort After Parties & Aeroplanes. Again a collaborative affair featuring the likes of Doorly, Gene Farris and Cajmere, it was a more jacking, sharp-edged treat designed for maximum dance floor impact, but was also stuffed with unforgettable vocals that agin saw Sonny stepping up his game.\n\n2016 saw the already influential artist stepping up yet again, this time by making his brilliant entry into the hallowed Defected In the House series. His standout contribution is a terrific three disc affair that is jam packed with his own stellar originals and remixes as well as some brand new and exclusive material (including Sonny Fodera ft. Alex Mills \u2013 \u2018Always Gonna Be,\u2019 Sonny Fodera ft. Shannon Saunders \u2018Over This\u2019 and \u2018The Definition\u2019 amongst many others). Aside from that high impact work, Sonny has also turned out a consistently excellent string of EPs on labels like Defected, Dirtybird and Visionquest, as well as remixing Rudimental. Never was he in finer form that with \u2018Let Go\u2019, a collaboration with Cervendos that sat pretty in the Beatport Deep House Top 10 for no fewer than 12 weeks in 2014, whilst more recently, his current single with Yasmin, \u2018Feelin U\u2019 shot straight in to the 2nd spot in the Beatport chart, only to be outdone by a stunning remix of Gershon Jackson on the legendary Strictly Rhythm label. As such, Sony currently has no fewer than six releases in the Beatport Deep House Top Ten, proving that he is very much creating the sounds of now for DJs and dancers everywhere.\n\nAs a result, of course, Sonny is a hugely in demand DJ who started 2016 with a 30 date tour of the UK, United States and Australia. It was his smooth technical skills in the booth that first won him the affections of Green Velvet, and nowadays he weaves his tight, seductive sets featuring all colours of the house spectrum everywhere from Footwork Toronto to Warung in Brazil, Cielo in New York City to Pacha, Sankeys, Amnesia DC10 and in Ibiza as well as We ARE FSTVL and many others.\n\nThe future is just as bright as the past for Sonny, who was born in Adelaide, Australia, and has lived between there, Ibiza, the USA and the UK since, though he is currently settled in London. It means he is fully focussed on the next chapter, which already promises to be a thrilling one for his fans, with a new album due on Defected \u2018Frequently Flying\u2019 , as well as more EPs on influential labels like Cajual and Lee Foss\u2019s highly anticipated new imprint, Repoulate Mars.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Wild Nothing ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8973666.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Alternative, Dream Pop, Shoegaze", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Captured Tracks / Big Nothing (JAP)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tallulah Goodtimes ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6969022.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tallulah Goodtimes is a 21st Century Flapper and the Queen of Goodtimes Swing.\n\nPlaying reet neet beats for the feet, she keeps every dancefloor entertained with her skilful blend of the best electro swing tunes.\n\nStruck by the sheer joy, and distinction of the Electroswing sound, the drama, and the costume, Tallulah Goodtimes burst through the dusky shadows in 2012.

Very soon Moit (guitar) completed the lineup and Oranssi Pazuzu, The Demon of the Wind with the Colour of Cosmic Energy, was born. During it\u2019s initial months the band wrote songs collectively, fusing together various influences from space rock to black metal, to capture different states of mental cosmos. These early songs were recorded by Sami Jormanainen in Korjak\u2019s family cabin in the late summer of 2008 and released as the group\u2019s debut album Muukalainen puhuu by Violent Journey Records in April 2009. In 2009-2010 Oranssi Pazuzu played shows around Finland and continued to write music that twisted towards more metallic and aggressive moods. In September 2010 they played first concerts outside Finland in Germany and the Netherlands. In November a split album with friend\u2019s band Candy Cane was released as a co-operation of two labels Firebox and Verdura Records. Kosmonument, their second full length album, was recorded in the old cold Karhu Manor in March 2011. Candy Cane\u2019s Marko Neuman acted as an artistic advisor, while Sami Jormanainen returned to the engineering and mixing duties. A concept album about a drifter lost in the void, Kosmonument was released in October 2011 as a cd by Spinefarm Records and as a double vinyl album by Blackspin Music. Also a vinyl version of the debut Muukalainen puhuu was released in May 2011 by Svart Records. After the release of Kosmonument, Oranssi Pazuzu played various European festivals in 2012, including Roadburn and Hellfest. They returned home satisfied, having also met Nikos Giagoudakis, who kindly decided to start as the band\u2019s manager. Being dropped from Spinefarm label, the band decided that it was time to move forward, and returned to writing new material with a newfound enthusiasm and freedom. Agreeing to work with Jaime Gomez Arellano, a London-based producer and engineer, Oranssi Pazuzu travelled to his Orgone Studios to record their third album in February 2013. After a succesful session with Gomez, the band finalized a new record deal with their old vinyl label Svart Records and with 20 Buck Spin for the album\u2019s North American release. Oranssi Pazuzu\u2019s third album is called Valonielu, and it will be released on in October 2013. Produced, recorded and mixed by Jaime Gomez Arellano, it includes six songs that rank among the band\u2019s most ambitious yet, from the album opener Vino verso\u2019s trance metal to the epic finale of Ympyr\u00e4 on viiva tomussa.

Though like almost all love stories, this one is not without its complications. Offering wistful rumination on how mental health can send shockwaves through even the most intimate and entwined of relationships, \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 sees Karima strike a masterful balance of meditative and melancholy songwriting.\n\n\u201cIn a world where we sometimes feel we can\u2019t speak out, we tend to take it the worst out on people closest to us.\u201d says Karima, opening-up about the track\u2019s fragile subject matter.\nRelocating from the shores of the Irish Sea to the expansive horizons of the Pacific last year, \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 was one of a number of new songs penned in Venice Beach, California, as the singer found herself instinctively drawn to the sun and sounds radiating from the West Coast and its simmering alternative scene. Finding a kindred spirit in LA producer Tim Carr (who also produced her sublime \u2018Shelf Life\u2019 track of last year), the textured and transient feel of \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 is testament to the stimulating new environs Karima found herself writing in.\n\u201cI was fantasising about making more, organic, saturated sounding records for a long time and alongside this, I wanted to record out in America as I was finding most of my musical influences were artists from America.\u201d she says. \u201cLast year I made the move to go out to California to find the sound for the new record and to immerse myself in the West Coast indie/alternative scene and out there, the relationship with Tim bloomed and the music was made.\u201d\n\nDusky of atmosphere and mellifluous of melody, the record also features appearances from close friend Simon Edwards on Bass (who notably played on Talk Talk\u2019s seminal \u2019Spirit of Eden\u2019 record; a favourite of Karima\u2019s), plus London-based singer/songwriter Klara from Sweden who feathers the record with its ethereal omnichord layerings.\n\nProduced by Tim Carr, the track was further mastered by Grammy-nominated Phillip Shaw Bova (Andy Shauf, Father John Misty).\n\n\u2018Orange Rose\u2019 arrives with a captivating video filmed in Las Vegas just before Christmas last year. \u201cI had the idea about a concept of self-destructive behaviour\u201d she says, \u201ca constant running away from our fears which potentially ends in us running away from the people who can make us whole again.\u201d Subtle of narrative and cinematic in quality, the video finds Karima lost deep in thought and caught-up between a rock and a hard place in the Nevada state city. Karima Francis is a critically acclaimed musician and songwriter, renowned for her innate ability to blend haunting melodies with honest lyrics and alluring ambiance. With an ear for music evident from an early age, Karima went on to release her debut album \u2018The Author\u2019 in 2009 to widespread critical acclaim. Her consequent album\u2019s \u2018The Remedy\u2019 (2012) and \u2018Black\u2019 (2016) witnessed further acknowledgment of her artistic abilities and saw her truly begin to spread her wings. Her journey to date has found her playing on Later\u2026 With Jools Holland, supporting the likes of Paul Simon, Amy Winehouse and The Stereophonics, as well as working with renowned producer Flood (Nine Inch Nails, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, Depeche Mode). Entering her thirties, Karima found a new rhythm to recording life on the West Coast of the USA last year. Beguiling new single \u2018Orange Rose\u2019 and last year\u2019s \u2018Shelf Life\u2019 are just the first fruits to taste from the latest chapter of Karima Francis\u2019 transfixing career.\nKarima Francis releases new single \u2018Orange Rose\u2019, 15th May 2020.", "otherInfo": "Join me for a release party for my brand new single 'Orange Rose' which comes out on May 15th.\n\n\n\nThere'll be a live Q&A where atendees can ask any questions as well as 'Orange Rose' performance.\n\n\n\nEach guest will recieve a free download link to 'Orange Rose'.\n\n\n\nOnly 100 tickets!\n\n\n\nLooking forward to seeing everyone!\n\n\n\nKarima x"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "T-Pain ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9394949.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "T-Pain", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "T-Pain (born Faheem Najim in Tallahassee, Florida in 1985) is an American hip-hop singer. At the age of ten he turned his bedroom into a small studio with a keyboard, beat machine and four-track recorder, and began enjoying music. He was previously a member of the five-man rap act known as Nappy Headz. In 2002 he founded his own label, Hard & B. T-Pain had been known locally in Florida for his work with Nappy Headz, and gained notoriety for his song \"Fucked Up\", a reworked version of Akon's \"Locked Up\". The song gained the attention of Akon, who then signed T-Pain to his newly formed Konvict Music record label. T-Pain released his solo debut single, \"I'm Sprung\", in August 2005. His debut album, Rappa Ternt Sanga, was released on November 8, 2005, under Konvict Music. The \"T\" in T-Pain actually stands for Tallahassee (Florida), and the Pains means the pain trying to get out of Tallahassee. He made the song \"I'm Sprung\" for a girl that he knew when he was younger. On BET's 106 & Park he told audiences that that girl is now his wife. T-Pain is related to the Omoegbele family. He is also known to be experimenting in the now world-famous \"Crunk-n-B\" style of music made famous by artists such as Ciara.\n\nHit singles \"Bartender Feat. Akon \" I'm Sprung\" and \"I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)\" spawned official remixes titled \"I'm Sprung 2\" with Trick Daddy and the YoungBloodZ, and \"I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper), The Remix\" with R.Kelly, Twista, Pimp C, Paul Wall, MJG, and Too $hort respectively.\n\nAs well as working with Akon on some tracks, he is also featured on a number of songs which made the charts (much like Akon), such as \"She Got it\" by 2 Pistols, and \"Low\" by Flo Rida.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Linda Perry ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/134330.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born on April 15, 1965, in Springfield, MA, Linda Perry spent her youth struggling with kidney disease and then addiction before focusing on music. Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours.

Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "Entry is a choose-your-own-donation basis between $1-100.

He began trombone lessons at the age of 9, and his early interests ranged from Swiss folk music to American R&B and jazz. He entered the local conservatory at 14 and graduated in 2002 after being awarded prizes in both the jazz and classical spheres, including the 2000 Benny Golson Prize.

A year later, Samuel won the J.J. Johnson Prize in 2006.\n\nIn his relatively short career, Blaser has worked with Swiss percussion legend Pierre Favre, pianist Hal Galper, drummer John Hollenbeck, saxophonist Michael Blake and Fran\u00e7ois Houle's 5+1 group; he has worked closely with Grammy Award winning producer Robert Sadin and most recently with Billy Mintz.\n\n2015 will see Blaser touring with two trios: one with guitarist Marc Ducret featuring Danish drummer Peter Bruun and the other with French pianist Benoit Delbecq and American drummer Gerry Hemingway.

Blaser will also reunite his Consort in Motion (Kind of Blue, 2011) group with pianist Russ Lossing, Belgian reed player Joachim Badenhorst, bassist Drew Gress and Hemingway, replacing the late Paul Motian from the recording.

Since his 2007 debut as a leader, 7th Heaven (Between the Lines), Blaser has grown at an almost incomprehensible rate, from a straight-ahead hard bopper in his mid-twenties to an innovative free player and ever-searching composer and bandleader in his early thirties - one whose improvisational strength has received high praise from media the world over.\n\nBorn and raised in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Blaser lived in New York City for many years before relocating to Berlin, where he currently resides. He began trombone lessons at the age of 9, and his early interests ranged from Swiss folk music to American R&B and jazz. He entered the local conservatory at 14 and graduated in 2002 after being awards prizes in both the jazz and classical spheres, including the 2000 Benny Golson Prize. Participation in the heralded Vienna Art Orchestra and European Radio Big Band eventually led to a Fullbright Scholarship, facilitating studies in the United States at the Purchase College Conservatory of Music.\n\nIn his relatively short career, Blaser has worked with Swiss percussion legend Pierre Favre, pianist Hal Galper, drummer John Hollenbeck and saxophonist Michael Blake, and has worked with Grammy Award-winning producer Robert Sadin, and more recently with Daniel Humair and Michel Portal.\n\n2018 will see Blaser touring with his trio featuring French guitarist Marc Ducret and Danish drummer Peter Bruun. Blaser is also back on the road with his original quartet to promote Early in the Morning, an homage to the Blues with Russ Lossing on piano, Masa Kamaguchi on bass, drummer Gerry Hemingway, Wallace Roney on trumpet and Oliver Lake on alto saxophone.\n\nSamuel Blaser is a XO Sophisticated Brass Artist\n\nInto The Shed\nIn order to fight against the spread of the Coronavirus, tremendous cuts were done.

Her introduction\nto jazz was the result of the fortuitous location of her upbringing, the village Samois\u00adsur\u00adSeine\u2014the\nsame place where legendary gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt had lived. Every June for decades,\ngypsies have descended upon Samois, setting up caravans in nearby meadows for the annual Django Reinhardt Festival. During those June nights many years ago, after her parents would fall asleep, a\nyoung, curious Aim\u00e9e would climb out her bedroom window and wander into the gypsy encampments.\nAim\u00e9e would sing by the fire with Django\u2019s descendents and began to fall in love with the gypsy way of\nlife\u2014scampering home before the sun rose. Explained Aim\u00e9e, \"I was hypnotized by gypsy music which\nmade me want to tap my feet\u037e music that swings makes me so happy.\"\nAs a teenager, Aim\u00e9e performed in various Parisian caf\u00e9s and clubs. When her family moved to\nSingapore, she remained in Paris to attend the American School of Modern Music. She also auditioned\nfor \"Star Academy,\" a kind of French \"American Idol.\" Selected to be one of 16 semi\u00adfinalists, Aim\u00e9e\nhad second thoughts when handed a contract that tied her up every which way for years\u2014including the\nsongs to sing. This was too much for her gypsy spirit\u2014so she quit. The French media so pursued\nAim\u00e9e, she sought refuge in her mother's homeland of the Dominican Republic.\nGiven it\u2019s proximity to New York City, Aim\u00e9e then opted to attend SUNY Purchase on a scholarship.\nShe discovered campus life as a freshman and Manhattan as a sophomore\u2014and her musical influences\ngrew in leaps and bounds.\nIn 2006, Aim\u00e9e organized a backpacking tour of Europe where she and musician friends played and\nsang on street corners. In 2007, the group targeted jazz festivals where they performed for food and\nlodging. On a whim, Aim\u00e9e entered the Montreux Jazz Voice Competition and won\u037e the prize included\nthe financing of a her first full\u00adlength recording, \"Cyrille Aim\u00e9e & The Surreal Band.\" Just months later\nanother surreal experience would follow: Aim\u00e9e found herself performing on a major European tour with\nthe French supergroup Caravan Palace\u2014filling\u00adin for their ailing lead vocalist.\nIn recent years Aim\u00e9e has toured in many different contexts and has created several self\u00adproduced\nrecordings, including duet projects with Brazilian guitarist Diego Figueiredo.

The Edmonton, Kentucky-based rock n\u2019 roll quartet Black Stone Cherry was raised on musical forefathers such as Cream, Led Zeppelin, Muddy Waters, and the Faces, among other 1970s staples, and, now, with its sixth album, Family Tree, BSC salutes its classic rock heritage and honors its legacy with a beast of a Southern rock n\u2019 roll album.\n\n\u201cWe caught divine intervention with this one,\u201d guitarist Ben Wells says with a good chuckle. \u201cWe hit a creative spark and tapped into a spirit and a fire we hadn\u2019t before.\u201d Drummer John Fred Young adds: \u201cFamily Tree showcases all of our collective musical influences and how we have taken those to create something that is truly our own unique Southern American Rock \u2018N Roll Sound.\u201d\n\nFor 17 years, Black Stone Cherry has put forth a new vicious breed of Southern rock, injecting youthful vitality and a myriad of fresh new influences into the beloved American rock tradition. To date, the band has released five critically acclaimed albums, and one well-received blues EP. Black Stone Cherry has also rocked 12,000-cap arena shows, topped the UK charts, and shared the stage with a diverse roster of superstars, including Def Leppard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bad Company, M\u00f6torhead, and ZZ Top.\n\nBlack Stone Cherry came together in 2001 in Edmonton, Kentucky, eventually coalescing around the lineup of Chris Robertson, vocals and guitar; Ben Wells, guitar and vocals; Jon Lawhon, bass and vocals; and John Fred Young, drums. Young's dad Richard, and his Uncle Fred, are two members of the iconic country-fried rock n\u2019 roots band The Kentucky HeadHunters, and the high school-aged boys came up honing their craft in the group\u2019s Practice House, a 1940s bungalow.\n\n\u201cWe grew up in the Kentucky Headhunters\u2019 rehearsal space, looking up at posters of Cream, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, the Stones, Montrose, and the Faces. We were like kids someone took in a time capsule and put in the woods,\u201d says drummer John Fred Young.\n\nLike the band\u2019s previous album and EP, Black Stone Cherry opted to self-produce and track Family Tree at David Barrick's Barrick Recording, the same studio where BSC recorded its self-titled debut and Kentucky albums . BSC also opted to not over-rehearse in advance of the album, instead preferring the immediacy and spontaneity of in the-moment takes. \u201cThere was a lot of laughter in the studio this time, and an air of comfort because we had self-produced the last few releases. It helped us get down to the nitty gritty bones of our music,\u201d says bassist Jon Lawhon. The band also entrusted guitarist and vocalist Chris Robertson to mix the album. This homespun approach perfectly suited the loose but epiphanic creative sessions that birthed Family Tree.\n\nFamily Tree boasts BSC\u2019s tried-and-true lucky number with its 13 songs, and, like all BSC releases, features songwriting contributions from each member. The result is a modern and meaty blues-based rock album, with unexpected sonic twists like punchy horn sections, barrelhouse pianos, Southern gospel organ, atmospheric synthesizer passages, and forays into funk and country.\n\nThe title track melds brawny blues riffage with BSC\u2019s most telepathic ensemble playing, showcasing the group\u2019s maturation as a unit without detracting from its Southern, hard rock wallop. The album also packs some satisfyingly surprising moments. \u201cCarry Me On Down The Road\u201d is a sleek slice of pure 1970s American rock n\u2019 roll\u2014something you would hear blaring out of a 1972 Chevy El Camino. \u201cJames Brown\u201d offers forth some stanky swamp-funk, replete with wah-wah guitars and gospel girl vocals. \u201cBad Habit,\u201d however, dripping sensual innuendo hammered home by a horny groove-rock beat, delivers some prime hooky and heavy BSC.\n\nOne Family Tree centerpiece is the rustically elegant \u201cMy Last Breath,\u201d a sweetly downhome ode to the unbreakable bonds of family. The song\u2019s goose bump-inducing call and response male and female vocal breakdown is one of those musical moments where light just shines through the speakers and you know everything is going to be alright.\n\nTwo special guests bring Family Tree full circle, one being Chris\u2019 5 year-old son singing backup on the brawny swaggering \u201cYou Got The Blues,\u201d and the other being jam band icon Warren Haynes\u2019 vocal and guitar cameo on the delta stomp of \u201cDancing In The Rain.\u201d The band first met Warren 17 years ago when they first came to New York to showcase for their new label. \u201cI remember coming to New York when we first were signed, and hearing Warren\u2019s voice behind me the minute my feet hit the street,\u201d recalls bassist Jon Lawhon. \u201cHearing him play on this track all these years later gave me chills.\u201d\n\nHaving Warren guest on the album was a wonderful gesture of \u201cyou\u2019re in the family now.\u201d It was truly a validation of all the miles the band has clocked on tour, and the dues the guys have paid being away from home. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how four good old boys from nowhere Kentucky can still be around 17 years later,\u201d singer/guitarist Chris Robertson says. Ben Wells concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t remember how life was outside of Black Stone Cherry.

A friend had put on a hardcore show and needed someone to play songs between the bands, so he showed up with a rucksack full of Metal Hammer compilations and precisely no idea what he was doing. No one cared (apart from that one guy who wanted to hear Snapcase). Over that summer, he took his first regular night, acting as second DJ in the second room of a rock night held in a dance club. This was slightly successful, lasting a crazy three-ish months. Later that year, he and a couple of guys were given the opportunity to put on a student rock night at the NTU student venue. Still without a clue what they were doing, they persevered, honed their craft, and created the mighty organ now known as Assault, which has been running ever since, and going from strength to strength. At a similar time, he was resident at Nottingham's Pitty Patt Club burlesque revue, playing 50s rock n' roll and showtunes. And providing music for the performers to remove their clothes to. Naturally. Fast forward to 2008, and DJ Apocalypse was approached by the then-new Redeemer Clubnights to fill a residency at their Leicester venue, a venture which saw him play venues from London to Newcastle, and providing the backstage music for the High Voltage and Sonisphere festivals, as well as the prestigious Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards Ceremony. In the last couple of years, he has also picked up another couple of residencies; at Perdition in Nottingham, and Wake The Dead in Woking. Along the way, he's guested at a variety of nights and events, including the famous Wendy House's 10th birthday extravaganza, the Bizarre Ball, the Rammstein aftershow party at London's O2 Arena, and for the last three years the mighty Download Festival.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf.

Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON).

The previously most recent album, 2014\u2019s Too Bright, stepped out saucily onto a bigger stage, expressing, with the production help of Adrian Utley, emotions arranged all along the slippery continuum from rage to irony to love. Now here we have seized the vocabulary of the full expression of all music.\n\nWHAT IS THIS\nHere in 13 ferocious and sophisticated tracks, Mike Hadreas and his collaborators blow through church music, makeout music, an array of the gothier radio popular formats, rhythm and blues, art pop, krautrock, queer soul, the RCA Studio B sound, and then also collect some of the sounds that only exist inside Freddy Krueger. Tremolo on the electric keys. Nightclubbing. Daywalking. Peter Greenawaying, Springsteening, Syreetaing.\n\nWHY\nLuridness was a quality of music in the 1960s that is mostly since shunned. The big male crooners were all fiercely lurid as an expression of passion or lustiness or general dickability. That\u2019s something perfect to take back. You took us to church and told us to believe in ghosts. You took us to school and told us to believe in the great American project of inclusion. Instead we started fucking to the great American project of rock and roll. There\u2019s more than one sexy soul song here. Seduction is also spellcraft. Rock and roll was an incantation, a beg to give it up baby. It\u2019s not that different from begging Some Thing to not let you die when you are alone and afraid.\n\nA QUICK BREAK ABOUT HOW\nBlake Mills \u2014 the one who produced the Alabama Shakes record and who performs with John Legend \u2014 produced the record with precision and expansion. Some things are pretty and some are blasted beyond recognition. In the studio with Shawn the engineer, Mike and Blake would hear quite different voices as they worked and they built this together.\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC OF WHY\nGod is all around actually and some of these songs are about being equal and some are about the witchcraft of believing. This is church music the same way Prince\u2019s Black Album is \u2014 too dirty. It\u2019s femme art pop the way Kate Bush\u2019s The Dreaming is \u2014 too scary. Prayer is indistinguishable from OCD but feels a lot cleaner.\n\nLIFE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE EACH STRIVE FOR HAPPINESS\n1. \u201cI felt like when I made these other albums, people were like why are you talking about these things, and now people are going to be like, why aren\u2019t you talking about these things, because everything\u2019s so terrible. I\u2019m never not talking about it. My life is existing in the fucking face of it. My music will always be in protest.\u201d\n2. \u201cI pay my rent. I\u2019m approaching health. The things that are bothering me personally now are less clear, are more confusing. I don\u2019t think I really figured them out with these songs. There\u2019s something freeing about how I don\u2019t have it figured out. Unpacking little morsels, magnifying my discomfort, wading through buried harm, laughing at or digging in to the embarrassing drama of it all. I may never come out the other side but it\u2019s invigorating to try and hopefully, ultimately helpful. I think a lot of them are about trying to be happy in the face of whatever bullshit I created for myself or how horrible everything and everyone is.\u201d\n3. \u201cI can steal from people that are on the inside and act as if. I created my whole identity around never being on the inside.\u201d\n\nLISTENING IN\nWho gets to live now? That\u2019s a question up for active international debate. Lots of folks are getting a clear view into what they all think of us. When we can, we should not have to care. You should feel great listening here, even when you\u2019re sad. Our job is to find love and connection and goodness. Records like this, records that make you feel like you\u2019re 15 and just seeing the truth for the first time, are excessively rare. They\u2019re here to remind you that you\u2019re divine.\n\n--Choire Sicha", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anthony D'Amato ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9501754.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Folk, Rock, Acoustic, Indie, Americana", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Produced by Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes, First Aid Kit) and recorded with contributions from an Omaha all-star team including Conor Oberst and members of Bright Eyes, The Faint, and Cursive, 'Cold Snap' is Anthony D'Amato's most ambitious record yet.

It is Nitze's journey through our world. And the sound originates from the stillness of our apartments at night. Our home.\nQuestioned about his musical roots and influences, Nitze replies: \"I grew up listening to \"This Mortal Coil\". David Sylvian's songs have always been a part of my life to the present day. Robert Smith was like my \"guitar teacher\". I think \"A Forest\" was the first piece I played on the guitar. For me Ivo Watts Russell is one of the greatest innovators in the music industry. And in my view these archetypal albums were all created under his direction. In other words what we today call 4AD. The Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, Dead can Dance, Clan of Xymox... These are albums that aren't hyped much but everyone knows them. If they hadn't existed, the music world would have been a much poorer place. I'm especially thinking of albums like \"Sleep With The Fishes\". This influenced me a great deal.\nOn \"almost forgotten tales\" Nitze sets three poems by Dylan Thomas to music; he explains why: \"It is the sense of the absurd in his writing. His writing is a true source of inspiration to me. Jon Cale was the one who first introduced me to Thomas. I devoured everything he wrote. \"Being But Men\" is all about how simple it is to feel happiness. Something that we knew all about as children. It's so simple... but we've forgotten how to do it.

R. Castillo. While a lot of artists can say the same, the influence of music on Castillo\u2019s life began years before he was born. When Castillo\u2019s father was a boy, he idolized his brother who was nine years older and in the Navy. Castillo\u2019s uncle would come home on leave from the Navy and play guitar on the front porch, and Castillo\u2019s father aspired to play just like his older brother. Tragically, his uncle lost his life serving in the Navy and his father\u2014now the oldest son and responsible for his family\u2014never learned to play like he wanted. \u201cAs he got older [my father] said, \u2018If I ever have a son, I want to put a guitar in his hands and make sure he learns to play,\u2019\u201d Castillo says, and to honor the brother he lost, Castillo\u2019s father put a guitar into his son\u2019s hands at a very early age. His mother also loved music. She encouraged him to sing and find harmonies as she introduced him to all kinds of music, and both his father and mother\u2014a \u201ccloset poet\u201d and \u201cgrammar queen,\u201d respectively\u2014encouraged their son to write. It was no surprise then when their son was fronting bands and performing his own music by the time he was 13. With the bands he was in during middle and high school, Castillo would work his own original music into sets of well-known covers at parties and festivals, and the reaction was always very positive. \u201cIt always seemed that every time I\u2019d announce, \u2018Here\u2019s a song that I wrote,\u2019 it immediately drew people in, which caught my attention,\u201d Castillo recalls. \u201cI saw that people all the sudden weren\u2019t just out there dancing and having a good time, their attention was on the song that I\u2019d written. The reaction of those first few folks\u2014they don\u2019t realize it, the influence they had\u2014as they were out there listening and giving me those words of encouragement after they heard the songs, it really encouraged me to continue with the song writing. It really set me on the path that I\u2019m on today.\u201d Despite his early success, he didn\u2019t immediately run off to Nashville to pursue a record deal; his family assumed that first he would get a college education, though they encouraged him to continue with his music while doing so. However, avoiding the temptation to quit college wasn\u2019t easy when record labels started showing interest during his sophomore year. \u201cIt kind of scared my folks a little bit, because they thought that I was just going to stop everything and pack my bags and move to Nashville. It just seemed like the right thing at that point in time.\u201d It was the advice of friend Casey Monahan at the Texas Music Office that persuaded him he could do both, a decision he\u2019s happy with in retrospect: \u201cI often look back at that moment and I know that it didn\u2019t have a huge an impact. If I had moved over there, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. I was still able to do everything they wanted us to do, but at the same time we were still able to take care of things at home and I was able to continue my education.\u201d Over the last 15 years\u2014through his formative years, his time at the University of Texas, and up to the present day\u2014Castillo has written over a thousand songs for himself and other artists, 25 percent of which are in Spanish. His songwriting strays from that of many other artists, as his music is often more specific and personal than other artists\u2019 music. \u201cA lot of the stuff is based on life experiences and stuff that I\u2019ve gone through, personal stories,\u201d Castillo says of his songwriting. \u201cI try to take actual stories and actual experiences and lay them out in that three and a half minute length of a song.\u201d For Castillo, the joy of songwriting isn\u2019t in mass appeal, but connecting on a deeper, more-personal level with his listeners. \u201cI want to write about real things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about writing the basic love songs where everybody can relate. I want to write about stuff that people out there listening can actually hold on to and say, \u201cThat\u2019s my song. That guy wrote that song about my life and what I\u2019m going through.\u201d His latest single, \u201cThe Flip Side of Sober,\u201d was released on July 4, and is apart of a full CD release entitled The Hombre that Castillo expects to be released in late September. Other songs on the 16-track album include the classic Leo Sayer hit, \u201cMore Than I Can Say\u201d (one of his mother\u2019s favorites), and unofficial Texas High School football anthem, \u201cAny Given Friday.\u201d \u201cSome of my fellow artists and writers are like, \u2018Man you\u2019re nuts. You\u2019re the only one who would serve up that many songs in one project,\u2019\u201d Castillo remarks. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s music. I\u2019m cranking it out. I feel blessed to be able to write as much as I do. It gives me an opportunity to share some of myself with the fans.\u201d By Andrew Miller, Nashville Music Guide", "otherInfo": "J.R.

Whether it was \u201cLet it Be\u201d by The Beatles, \u201cBorn to Run\u201d by Bruce Springsteen (a fellow New Jersey native), or \u201cIt\u2019s My Party\u201d by Leslie Gore she was into it. A 90\u2019s baby herself, Bowman\u2019s knowledge and love for music spans decades. Inspired by pop acts and bands of the 90\u2019s in particular she knew she wanted to pursue music at an early age. After graduating high school, not having a clue how to pursue a career in music, she started going into New York City looking to meet with producers and songwriters who might want to work with her. After several failed auditions, several unreturned phone calls, and a little bit of heartbreak she met a producer who saw something in her. Bowman, only a singer at the time began recording songs written by the producer. Suggesting she start writing herself, with the melody and concept already started Bowman alongside her producer finished writing what would be her first single \u201cProblem.\u201d \u201cProblem\u201d was added to Sirius XM 20 on 20 and in 2 weeks was a top 5 requested song. Her next single \u201cKing Boy\u201d trumped her first becoming the 5th most played song of the year on Sirius XM 20 on 20 while also selling over 20,000 copies, a major feat for an independent artist.\n\nWith the success of her first 2 releases Bowman found herself writing with more and more producers/songwriters. She had been working on new music with a writer at Warner Chappell Publishing when the synch team there received a request for a song about staying warm. Alongside the producer Bowman wrote \u201cKeep Me Warm,\u201d a release that would play in a national McDonald\u2019s ad campaign for over a month, as well as receive airplay on 3 different radio formats: Top 40, Hot AC, and AC.\n\nContinuing to work alongside different writers/producers she caught the attention of Kobalt Music. A publishing company who\u2019s rosters includes the likes of Max Martin, Mumford and Sons, Simon and Garfunkel, Lionel Richie, Dixie Chicks, Beck, and countless other successful artists and songwriters. Eventually signed to a Kobalt publishing deal herself Bowman released \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d through AWAL, Kobalt\u2019s global artist services company. \u201cGood Time Good Life\u201d debuted on NBC\u2019s This Is Us, ran in a national Target ad, a national Beaches Resort ad, and was chosen by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drive The Oscar\u2019s 2017 promo aired on ABC for over 2 months. The Oscar promo lead to Bowman\u2019s national TV debut on Good Morning America where she performed \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d followed up with a performance at the Radio Disney Music Awards, and Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\nWith the success of \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d and a move out west (a NJ native now in Los Angeles) Bowman found herself working on music going in a slightly different direction. She was doing less co-writes and found herself writing everyday on her own. Songs started pouring out of her. Her life was changing and the music she was writing was some of the realest she had ever written. In March of 2018 Bowman found herself traveling to London to explore a new city and work on new music. A NJ native, now based in Los Angeles, traveling to London. It was on a whim that she decided to attend an open mic night where she\u2019d perform a couple of her new songs for the first time. It was at that open mic night that she would meet the 2 cowriters/producers that would bring this new direction of music, this new project, to life. Bowman traveled back to London for over a month in the summer and in the fall to work on what will be her first ever EP.

The younger brother of Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet, Doucet has used his distinctive hybrid of folk-style fingerpicking and bluegrass-like flatpicking to strengthen the performances of Beausoleil, the band he's shared with his brother for over 21 years. With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark & Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil).\nDoucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a \"Legends of Folk Violin\" tour.\n\n\nMore to come", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Gaelic Storm ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9072422.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Live Music, Irish Music, Indie, World & Chamber Music., Folk Music", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "After nearly two decades and more than 3,000 live shows, Gaelic Storm \u2014 the chart-topping, multi-national Celtic band \u2014 is looking sharper than ever with their latest release, Matching Sweaters. The new album mixes traditional Irish music with modern influences, creating a sound that's as wide-ranging as the band's own audience.\n\nFrom bluegrass fans and country cowboys to Deadheads, rock & rollers and Celtic fanatics, Gaelic Storm has built one of the most diverse fan bases in modern music. Matching Sweaters helps explain the broad appeal. Rooted in the songwriting of founding members Patrick Murphy and Steve Twigger, the album moves from drinking songs (\"Another Stupid Drinking Song\") to energetic instrumentals (\"The Narwhaling Cheesehead\") to rootsy pop/rockers (\"Whiskeyed Up and Womaned Out\"), gluing everything together with the spark and spirit of a band that's spent close to 20 years on the road.\n\n\"We're a touring band,\" says percussionist Ryan Lacey, who joined the lineup in 2003. \"That's how this band works.Matching Sweaters is one of the most complete albums we've done so far, because it taps into every facet of our live show.\"\n\nThose live shows date all the way back to the mid-1990s, when Gaelic Storm kicked off its career as a pub band in Santa Monica, California. By the end of the decade, the musicians had appeared in the blockbuster film \"Titanic\" (where they performed \"Irish Party in Third Class\") and laid the groundwork for a career that would eventually find them topping the Billboard World Chart five times, making appearances at mainstream music festivals such as Summerfest, Telluride and The Rock Boat Cruise, and regularly headlining the largest Irish Festivals across the country, all the while gaining a reputation as a genre-bending Irish band whose songs mix Celtic traditions with something new and unexpected. Now, with the band's 20th anniversary on the horizon, they're putting even more emphasis on those newer directions.\n\n\"We'll push the envelope, then reel it back in, then push it again,\" says Murphy. \"There's a lot of variety here, and that's why we can play country festivals, bluegrass festivals and rock festivals, and still fit in perfectly with each one. We wanted Matching Sweaters to reflect that range, so people could buy the CD and hear everything we're able to do in concert.\"\n\nWhen it came time to write Matching Sweaters' 12 songs, Murphy and Twigger teamed up with longtime friend and co-writer Steve Wehmeyer. Together, the three found inspiration in everything from old Irish newspapers (\"The Rustling Goat Gang,\" whose details were gleaned from an article about a vanishing goat herd from Waterford) to bits of conversation overheard in local pubs (\"Paddy's Rubber Arm\").\n\nIn addition to writing new songs, the musicians have continued to play new markets every year, taking the chance to stretch their boundaries \u2014 and widen their audience \u2014 whenever possible. It helps keep them on their toes.\n\n\"Playing for a new crowd is great,\" says Twigger. \"It takes you back to those early days, where you've got something to prove. We could just do Irish festivals, but why not play a crossover show where 90% of the audience doesn't know you, and you have to make them know you? That's what makes your band good.\"\n\nMatching Sweaters follows in that hard-working tradition, dishing up all the ingredients fans have come to expect from Gaelic Storm \u2014 the drinking songs, sea shanties, furiously-strummed instrumentals and sing-along melodies \u2014 while spiking the mix with newer flavors.

The band ended abruptly in 2009 when our grandparents died, then our father just a few months later. Sean moved 3000 miles away and joined the military and my music career faded. I worked a landscape job and married the love of my life. My marriage would later become a catalyst for change I never knew could emerge.\n\nIn 2012, my wife and I moved back home to Birmingham. I found myself in music again, learning how to make a living performing covers for the first time. Who knew playing other people\u2019s music would be a platform for finding my way again?\n\nHowever, the booze, the partying, the late nights, even the pride and selfishness that grew inside got the best of me and, therefore, my relationship. At the time of releasing, \u201cHey Y\u2019all\u201d in 2015, my first single and music video as a returning original artist, my wife left. I was on the road and we separated. I found myself alone in an empty apartment, falling deeper into my lifestyle and into a depression. After a four-day binge and an episode where I thought I might die, I finally asked for help. Tired of trying, tired of pushing, tired of losing it all to a dream; motivated by my own ego, I got down on my knees and gave it all to God.\n\nIt started with giving up my obsession with alcohol. On my road to recovery God has renewed my mind and my spirit and He has rejuvenated my sense of self-worth. A lot has changed after three years of sobriety. Since then I have started touring, surrounded myself with family and friends and finished an album that I\u2019m proud to share with the world. My hope and prayer is that my music would inspire and encourage everyone who hears to do whatever \u201cIt\u201d is; because Sooner or Later whatever \u201cIt\u201d is, is going to \u2013 so let it.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Craig Cardiff ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10380288.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Roots, Indie, Traditional, Singer-songwriter, Folk, Acoustic", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Canadian Singer-Songwriter\n100+ million streams\n100% fan powered\n\nCANADA: brandhawa@apa-agency.com\nUS: domenique@ecgnyc.com\n\nMGMT - tom@ecgnyc.com", "otherInfo": "Please follow on instagram for live stream concert updates.\n\n\n\neveryday 7pm - 7:30pm where bring the songs to you for singalonging.\n\n\n\nplease follow on all the regular social media and such.\n\n\n\nRemember:\n\nbe honest, silly and kind. avoid mischief and jealousy.\n\n\n\nbe gentle with yourself. be gentle with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider supporting the music / team on patreon.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/craigcardiff"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Aegyokiller ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bandits On The Run ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8205194.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Americana, Folk Rock, Indie, Alternative Folk, Indie Pop, Indie Folk, Acoustic", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bandits on the Run is Brooklyn's very own criminal whimsy ring, composed of cellist/badass Bonanza Jellyfish, guitarist/fool Roy Dodger, and player-of-toys/clairvoyant Clarissa.

He has been seen outside venues at 3am in Germany playing an acoustic guitar and singing to people that didn\u2019t want the show to end. He has written poems to fans from behind bars whilst locked up on bogus marijuana charges. He has suffered a spiral fracture of the humerus while arm wrestling a marine in Hawaii. He has recorded with and toured alongside some of independent rap music\u2019s most influential figures, including Sage Francis, Busdriver and Astronautalis. He has been in bands described as hardcore, crunk rap, lo-fi synth pop, Latin progressive and psych-jazz-rap. He has crafted abstracted and personal narratives mining the depths of depression and heights of hope. He has slept on countless floors when hotels weren\u2019t in the touring budget and lost girlfriends and jobs all for the love of creating and performing.\n\nCeschi was born with four fingers on his right hand, which served as partial inspiration for the name of his DIY record label, Fake Four, Inc. Those who have worked with him describe Ceschi as one of the most artist-friendly labelheads out there, a rare breed who values art over profit almost to a fault. Since 2008, he has curated a roster of wildly original and critically praised talent and put out albums from the likes of Open Mike Eagle, Buck 65, Sister Crayon and Dark Time Sunshine in addition to his solo records The One Man Band Broke Up and Broken Bone Ballads.\n\nAn engaging, theatrical live performer, Ceschi Ramos has treated entire venues like a stage, viewing the middle of the audience or an empty barstool as good a place as any to perform a soul-baring folk song or tongue-twisting rap track. Ceschi once described himself in song as \u201ca martyr at most\u2026 a failure at least\u201d and said that, \u201cIn the eyes of history I\u2019ll be no more than a leaf on a tree.\u201d He knows what it is to suffer for his art and is aware that music exploring the ugliness and sorrow of the human condition will always exist on the fringes of a game dominated by disposable escapism and expensive publicists. Yet he still pours everything he has into his craft, and on any given night you can find him tracking vocals at his cousin\u2019s New Haven studio, warmly greeting fans and friends at a dive bar merch booth or rapping double-time in Japan or Europe for audiences that often don\u2019t speak his language, but are able to see the giant heart at the core of it all.", "otherInfo": "We are excited to announce Fake Four Fridays!

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Natty Nation ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10380619.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "Reggae, Jam Rock, Rock, Roots Rock Reggae, Hard Roots Rock Reggae, Jamband, Dub, Hard Roots Rock Reggae & Dub, Roots Reggae", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Critically-acclaimed reggae outfit Natty Nation is a collective of spiritual warriors. For twenty years, the Madison, Wisconsin-based group has purely and fearlessly followed its inner artistic continuum.\n\nNatty Nation\u2019s unique pedigree of a Midwest home base and artistic openness has helped the posse foster a signature sound. The group describes themselves as hard roots rock reggae & dub because in addition to their honest and authentic roots reggae foundation, their embrace of soul, rock, and funk is undeniable. Natty Nation is also influenced by such diverse geniuses as Michael Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, Living Colour, Earth Wind and Fire, Fishbone, and Bad Brains. Currently, Natty Nation is led by JAH Boogie \u2013 bass & lead vocals (also percussion & drums in the studio), and musical director Aaron Konkol \u2013 keyboards, vocals, & melodica. The collective also features mainstays Paule Willis \u2013 drums, and Nick Czar \u2013 guitar.\n\nDivine Spark is a lightning bolt of an inspirational album artistically and introspectively. JAH Boogie explains: \u201cThe Divine Spark is the higher self within everyone. I've learned that through raising your vibration, and opening your chakras, you are able to tap into your divine spark.\u201d Artistically it\u2019s a watershed album as its was carefully crafted by the creative core of founding member JAH Boogie, and longtime member Aaron Konkol, who is a multi-instrumentalist and prodigious musical talent. The two shared in music writing responsibilities while JAH Boogie retained lyric duties.\n\nHighlights on Divine Spark include the title track, \u201cMeditation,\u201d \u201cCivil Rights,\u201d and \u201cProphecy.\u201d The album\u2019s spiritual core is the simmering and soulful title track. \u201cThis song deals with the spiritual essence of each human being,\u201d JAH Boogie explains. \u201cThe song also expresses that when you open your heart chakra it helps to open up the many other chakras within the spiritual body. When these energy centers or chakras are open then many other dimensions are open as well.\u201d \u201cMeditation\u201d aptly conjures its name with sweetly languid grooves. Soul rebel militancy bubbles over with the aptly titled, \u201cCivil Rights\u201d courtesy of F. Stokes\u2019s fiery rhymes. And the rousing \u201cProphecy\u201d is sure to inspire self-reflection. \u201cThis song deals with going within yourself to find out who you really are or what you really are. We all have spiritual guides or angels who reveal certain things to us,\u201d explains JAH Boogie.\n\nDivine Spark was mixed by legendary Bob Marley recording engineer Errol Brown (Rebelution, Gregory Isaacs, Burning Spear, among others). Errol mixed the album in his makeshift studio he built in the back of Rebelution's tour bus. He worked closely with Aaron Konkol\u2019s feedback and the two came up with a majestic mix.

They decided on their first name, Psychedelic Breakfast, based on the suggestion of Tramontano's cousin. It is a reference to Pink Floyd's song \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\" from their album Atom Heart Mother. Besides playing cover songs by classic rockers such as The Doors and Floyd, they released a self-titled DIY studio album in 1999. The band's popularity began to rise after four songs from this album were featured on the MTV series Undressed.\n\nThe band won their first Jammy for being \"New Groove of the Year\" in 2004. Around the same time, the band decided to change their name due to misnomers of the seriousness of the band leading to the loss of booking for shows and festivals. Spears defended the choice, though, saying that \"the Music is what is important, not the name.\" While supporting their 2005 release, Real Radio, the band performed a national tour, at times backing up popular bands such as The Wailers, moe., North Mississippi Allstars, and Gomez. In early July of 2006, Giangreco left and the band continued on as a trio.\n\nThe band is also known for a high level of musicianship. In the current incarnation, instrument swapping between members is not uncommon. Guitar virtuoso Tim Palmieri also plays keyboards, drums and bass. Both Spears and Tramontano are highly proficient guitar players. Tramontano also plays the keyboards. Such swaps are usually reserved for encores, and are especially well received by fans. Members of the Breakfast also share vocal duties. While lead vocals are typically handled by either Palmieri (a baritone) or Spears (a tenor), Tramontano will occasionally act as a lead vocalist, but is most often heard providing harmonies.\n\nOn August 3rd, 2007, it was announced that Matt Oestreicher will be joining the band as the new keyboardist.\n\nwww.thebreakfast.org - Official site", "otherInfo": "Livestream: https://www.facebook.com/thebreakfast"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bianca Jade Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9881966.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 15 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-15", "Genre": "R&b", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Bianca Jade is a Cuban-Jamaican powerhouse RnB/Soul singer and songwriter from Miami, Florida now based in New York City.

Continuing on his freewheeling journey as a true musical citizen of the world, he follows the release of his acclaimed 2016 album This is Nate Najar with a warm, soulful, multi-faceted recording reflecting his enduring love for the City of Lights, entitled Under Paris Skies, Set for release on Sept. 7, 2018, on Woodward Avenue Records, the 11-track collection explores Najar\u2019s passion for French jazz and pop with a deeper commitment and purpose than ever before and showcases the \u201crabbit hole\u201d of research he did to curate a unique eclectic variety of pop, jazz and classical songs rarely re-imagined by American jazz artists.\n\nWhile a deliberate departure from the jam session vibe and stylistically diverse nature of This is Nate Najar (2016)) the new album harkens back to his theme-driven earlier projects, Aquarela Do Brasil (2014) and Blues For Night People: The Nate Najar Trio Remembers Charlie Byrd (2012). Under Paris Skies is also a dynamic showcase of the trio\u2019s latest lineup (featuring Washington, DC bassist Tommy Cecil and UK drummer Matt Home) and Najar\u2019s work on his beloved Ramirez guitar, which previously belonged to Charlie Byrd. Longtime collaborators of the guitarist, Cecil and Home toured with Najar throughout 2017. \u201cWe\u2019re a solid unit, and it felt like the right one to record the new album with\u201d the guitarist says. Chuck Redd, who has played drums on many previous Najar projects (including Aquarela Do Brasil) adds his lush vibraphone harmonies and solos to two numbers.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t love Paris?\u201d Najar asks whimsically. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who says they don\u2019t want to go there, and if you\u2019ve been, how could you not want to go back? I have a love affair with France, which is a wonderful, romantic place on every level. There is such a rich cultural history, with so much global influence. Paris has traditionally been the center of many movements in classical music, but there\u2019s also an incredible legacy of pop and jazz music many Americans may not be familiar with.\u201d\n\nOne great example is the wonderful singer France Gall. Her song \u201cLa Mort Douce,\u201d featuring Najar\u2019s thoughtful acoustic improvisations and the subtle harmonic shadings of Cecil\u2019s bass, kicks off a deeply melodic, rhythmically diverse and improvisation-rich exploratory journey. Najar pays homage to legendary composer Michel Legrand via a brisk, lighthearted swing arrangement of \u201cI Will Wait for You,\u201d from the 1964 film Umbrellas of Cherbourg; Django Reinhardt, via a soulful, percussive romp through \u201cNuages,\u201d and the iconic Serge Gainsbourg with \u201cLa Javanaise,\u201d a waltz that Najar re-imagines with a spirited Caribbean vibe.\n\nAnother key stop Najar makes on Under Paris Skies is the moody, reflective title track \u201cSous le Ciel de Paris,\u201d from the 1951 film of the same name, penned by composer Hubert Giraud. The spirited \u201cCe Petit Chemin\u201d was originally recorded in the 30\u2019s by the beloved vocalist Mireille. Najar and Cecil engage in a hauntingly hypnotic guitar-bass duet of \u201cApr\u00e8s Un R\u00eave,\u201d which composer Gabriel Faur\u00e9 originally wrote for piano and soprano vocal. Redd\u2019s sensual vibes return on the Charles Aznavour ballad \u201cSa Jeunesse\u201d to join forces with Najar\u2019s strings on an easy flowing romantic adventure.\n\nUptempo, grooving jazz and swing create the buoyant rhythmic foundation of the playful yet intricately rendered Charles Trenet tune \u201cQue reste-t-il a nos amours?\u201d which became the American standard \u201cI Wish You Love,\u201d a huge hit for Keely Smith in 1958. Najar wraps up the collection with \u201cChanson du C\u0153ur Bris\u00e9,\u201d a slightly melancholy, richly improvisational ballad whose raw emotion is underscored by guitarist\u2019s scrapes on the wood; and the breezy, balmy, Brazilian leaning \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d which Najar says needs \u201cno real explanation. I tried to imagine how Joao Gilberto would approach it and gave it my best shot.\u201d\n\nThough he waited until more than a decade into his prolific recording career to create an album solely dedicated to the musical spirit of Paris, Najar has long considered Belgian born French legend Django Reinhardt as one of the guitarists who had the greatest impact on his development. The other two are Wes Montgomery and, obvious to anyone who has followed Najar\u2019s career, Charlie Byrd.\n\nHis three recordings on Candid Records \u2013 including Blues For Night People: The Nate Najar Trio Remembers Charlie Byrd and This Is Nate Najar \u2013 earned him accolades from critics and influential jazz voices alike. Becky Byrd, wife of the late guitarist Charlie Byrd, said, \u201cThere is no doubt that there is a piece of Charlie\u2019s soul in Nate\u2019s mind, heart and fingers.

Three years ago, the Chicago-based trio parted ways with their indie rock roots to record their own take on the hip hop classic \u201cSummertime.\u201d With a smooth bed of 808s and hand claps, the song made the rounds on lists of must-download summer songs and landed the band on Comedy Central\u2019s Tosh.0. But the American reception to the song paled in comparison to an unlikely spot on the map: Lithuania. While the band continued to wage the American DIY-band battle for attention at small club shows around the US, the situation was much different in the former member of the USSR. The band had become a household name, and the song\u2019s accompanying video had racked up more than one million views. \u201cWe started to get all these messages from fans in Eastern Europe about how much they loved the song,\u201d lead singer David McMillin says. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t think that we were catching on somewhere halfway around the world.\u201d Fast forward to 2015, and there was a big reason to start to believe their own hype: the US Embassy in Lithuania offered to bring Fort Frances to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, to headline one of the city\u2019s biggest summer festivals, Loftas Fest. The lineup included Mercury Prize-winning Young Fathers and XL/Terrible Records rapper Le1f. \u201cHere we are, this unknown band with our name alongside some of these huge artists from around the world,\u201d bassist Jeff Piper says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even believe we were going until we were on the plane.\u201d When the band touched down, they stepped into a scene reminiscent of Rodriguez discovering his fans in \u201cSearching for Sugar Man.\u201d The band\u2019s name was plastered on billboards and street signs. They appeared on \u201cGood Morning, Lithuania.\u201d They headlined the sold-out opening night of the festival. It was clear the band had found a second home. \u201cOur week in Lithuania was one of the most rewarding times of my life,\u201d McMillin says. \u201cYou start playing music in a garage without a clue of where it can take you. I never would have expected the road could lead us to a stage in the former Eastern Bloc.\u201d That same road brought them back home to put the finishing touches on a new full-length album with Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter, Lake Street Dive) in a studio tucked away in the woods of Parsonsfield, Maine with a refreshed outlook on creative exploration. The New England retreat gave the band an opportunity to cross into unfamiliar sonic territory. \u201cThere are moments on this record I never would have imagined we would have been able to make a few years ago,\u201d drummer Aaron Kiser says. The crunchy guitar-monies layered behind the falsetto phrasing of \u201cTake the Wheel\u201d, the marimba-sub synth combo of \u201cEverything is Starting to Make Sense\u201d, the frantic pacing of \u201cThe Light Years\u201d \u2014 this cast of songs puts the spotlight on a band that is growing increasingly comfortable with loosening its roots in the past. \u201cMemories are not meant to be kept inside a frame, so before we drive out to the coast tonight, I will drive myself insane,\u201d McMillin sings on lead single \u201cBuilding A Wall.\u201d \u201cOver the past year, I feel like we\u2019ve taken some big steps for the band,\u201d McMillin says. \u201cThe time overseas helped us open the door to welcome a world of new possibilities.\u201d When it came time to choose a title the album, the choice was clear. \u201cAlio\u201d is Lithuanian for hello. www.fortfrancesmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jenny Shawhan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8401863.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Mooresville, Indiana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Just listen to the music and you'll know.", "otherInfo": "Special Music Concert in the round with Stevey, Owen Kortz, Jenny Shawhan, Jaraneh Nova, & Kate Stone\n\n5pm PST, 6pm MST\n\nTo join the concert, click the Zoom webinar link provided for the show:\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/82506467025\n\nDonation based - you can join any part of the weekend that you want,\neveryone is welcome!!!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kari Lynch Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9043389.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Traditional Country, Performer, Songwriter, Indie, Country & Folk, Indie Folk Americana, Songwriters, Country Music, Country, American Country Music", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Country meets Americana meets Twangy Rock.

Discriminating against no style of music, classical, country, rock and heavy metal shaped who he would become. JUST JOE.\n\nCollege educated with degrees in History and Audio Engineering, and a minor in Secondary Education. But from that early age, he felt that music was his true calling. In September, 2001 he became the singer for BRAND NEW SIN. They released three albums and one EP with worldwide distribution and they toured extensively across North America, Great Britain and Ireland as both headliners and support. They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN. After plenty of writing and rehearsing, and after a few shows to debut the material, the band went into the studio and have completed the recording of the debut album, \u201cThe Last Days Of Planet Earth\u201d, which was released in September of 2011.

May\u2019s songwriting reveals her innate ability to emotionally engage with her audience through her lyrics. She shows us her heartbreak, but she also shows us her empowered and emboldened spirit. In her quest to find her most authentic self, May gifts each listener with a powerful, emotional experience that immediately connects her to us.\n\nRaised in a home full of art and music, Erlewine began writing songs at a very young age. As a teenager she hitchhiked across the country, honing her skills as a performer and absorbing the kind of stories and landscapes that would inform her music. She came to know the land and the pulse of the people. Her songs show a very real connection and concern with everyday folk. In the following years, Erlewine would perform in every kind of venue imaginable, from street corners to festival stages to the live-FM airwaves of A Prairie Home Companion.\n\nErlewine draws from a wide variety of influences to create her sound. Lyrically, her songs are rooted in hard-wrought wisdom, joy and sorrow, simplicity, and stories from her own everyday experiences. Musically, these messages are wrapped up in traditional folk roots, Americana, old-time country, swing, soul, and even rock n\u2019 roll. As a live performer, she is just as magnetic when fronting a seven-piece dance-party funk band as she is playing solo acoustic songs in a living room house concert.\n\nWith a long list of full length albums, two EPs, and numerous collaborations, Erlewine\u2019s catalog is proof of her creative power. Her work has been spotlighted by Rolling Stone and NBC\u2019s The Voice. National acts who have covered her songs include Greensky Bluegrass, Railroad Earth, Sawyer Fredericks (Season 8 winner of The Voice), Joshua Davis (Season 8 finalist of The Voice), Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys, and others.\n\nErlewine uses her music as a platform for positive change. She considers her job a service-oriented one and carries the torch of the folk singer activist. Her voice on stage encourages connectedness and stresses the importance of environmental advocacy, social justice, creative empowerment and community building as necessary work in our world. May's body of work has become an anthem and an example of why we need to listen to women, and why we need to hear their stories.\n\nMay\u2019s music has touched people all over the world. Her words have held solace for weary hearts, offered a light in the darkness, and held a lot of space for the pain and joy of being alive in these times.

His passion for music started early in life. His earliest musical memories involve listening to artists and groups from Vince Gill to Journey, Bryan Adams to smaller Christian and gospel groups of people that his mother sang with while in college. These would go on to deeply shape his tastes and style. Though Ben's family lived just outside of Nashville, much of his time growing up was spent on his grandparent's farm in the town in south Georgia of Cairo. Just as with hearing various styles of music, the experiences and lessons learned from this time influenced Ben's perspective on his music. From the time he was 4 years old, Ben constantly took part in youth church choirs, school talent shows and a few different bands as he discovered more and more about his own sound as an artist. By the time he was in high school, songwriting had become a major focus and goal for him alongside the performing that he had long been captivated with. After graduating from Centennial High School in Franklin, TN, Ben was accepted to Belmont University where he currently studies Music Business. During his first three years there, he has met a number of incredible people who have further influenced his direction as an artist and a writer and continually pushed him to be better. Ben is currently working on both writing and recording new music and looking to play as much as possible in and around Nashville. This is the official Facebook page of Ben Law.

Three years ago, the Chicago-based trio parted ways with their indie rock roots to record their own take on the hip hop classic \u201cSummertime.\u201d With a smooth bed of 808s and hand claps, the song made the rounds on lists of must-download summer songs and landed the band on Comedy Central\u2019s Tosh.0. But the American reception to the song paled in comparison to an unlikely spot on the map: Lithuania. While the band continued to wage the American DIY-band battle for attention at small club shows around the US, the situation was much different in the former member of the USSR. The band had become a household name, and the song\u2019s accompanying video had racked up more than one million views. \u201cWe started to get all these messages from fans in Eastern Europe about how much they loved the song,\u201d lead singer David McMillin says. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t think that we were catching on somewhere halfway around the world.\u201d Fast forward to 2015, and there was a big reason to start to believe their own hype: the US Embassy in Lithuania offered to bring Fort Frances to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, to headline one of the city\u2019s biggest summer festivals, Loftas Fest. The lineup included Mercury Prize-winning Young Fathers and XL/Terrible Records rapper Le1f. \u201cHere we are, this unknown band with our name alongside some of these huge artists from around the world,\u201d bassist Jeff Piper says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even believe we were going until we were on the plane.\u201d When the band touched down, they stepped into a scene reminiscent of Rodriguez discovering his fans in \u201cSearching for Sugar Man.\u201d The band\u2019s name was plastered on billboards and street signs. They appeared on \u201cGood Morning, Lithuania.\u201d They headlined the sold-out opening night of the festival. It was clear the band had found a second home. \u201cOur week in Lithuania was one of the most rewarding times of my life,\u201d McMillin says. \u201cYou start playing music in a garage without a clue of where it can take you. I never would have expected the road could lead us to a stage in the former Eastern Bloc.\u201d That same road brought them back home to put the finishing touches on a new full-length album with Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter, Lake Street Dive) in a studio tucked away in the woods of Parsonsfield, Maine with a refreshed outlook on creative exploration. The New England retreat gave the band an opportunity to cross into unfamiliar sonic territory. \u201cThere are moments on this record I never would have imagined we would have been able to make a few years ago,\u201d drummer Aaron Kiser says. The crunchy guitar-monies layered behind the falsetto phrasing of \u201cTake the Wheel\u201d, the marimba-sub synth combo of \u201cEverything is Starting to Make Sense\u201d, the frantic pacing of \u201cThe Light Years\u201d \u2014 this cast of songs puts the spotlight on a band that is growing increasingly comfortable with loosening its roots in the past. \u201cMemories are not meant to be kept inside a frame, so before we drive out to the coast tonight, I will drive myself insane,\u201d McMillin sings on lead single \u201cBuilding A Wall.\u201d \u201cOver the past year, I feel like we\u2019ve taken some big steps for the band,\u201d McMillin says. \u201cThe time overseas helped us open the door to welcome a world of new possibilities.\u201d When it came time to choose a title the album, the choice was clear. \u201cAlio\u201d is Lithuanian for hello. www.fortfrancesmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "May Erlewine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9334351.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Jazz, Traditional Folk, Soul, Old-time Country, Bluegrass, Roots, Swing, Americana", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "May Erlewine has split her heart wide open and hasn\u2019t hidden any of the contents from view.\n\nOne of the Midwest\u2019s most prolific and passionate songwriters, May\u2019s gift for writing empathetic and engaging songs that feel at once fresh and soulfully familiar has earned her a broad, devoted fan base well beyond her deep-set Michigan roots. May\u2019s songwriting reveals her innate ability to emotionally engage with her audience through her lyrics. She shows us her heartbreak, but she also shows us her empowered and emboldened spirit. In her quest to find her most authentic self, May gifts each listener with a powerful, emotional experience that immediately connects her to us.\n\nRaised in a home full of art and music, Erlewine began writing songs at a very young age. As a teenager she hitchhiked across the country, honing her skills as a performer and absorbing the kind of stories and landscapes that would inform her music. She came to know the land and the pulse of the people. Her songs show a very real connection and concern with everyday folk. In the following years, Erlewine would perform in every kind of venue imaginable, from street corners to festival stages to the live-FM airwaves of A Prairie Home Companion.\n\nErlewine draws from a wide variety of influences to create her sound. Lyrically, her songs are rooted in hard-wrought wisdom, joy and sorrow, simplicity, and stories from her own everyday experiences. Musically, these messages are wrapped up in traditional folk roots, Americana, old-time country, swing, soul, and even rock n\u2019 roll. As a live performer, she is just as magnetic when fronting a seven-piece dance-party funk band as she is playing solo acoustic songs in a living room house concert.\n\nWith a long list of full length albums, two EPs, and numerous collaborations, Erlewine\u2019s catalog is proof of her creative power. Her work has been spotlighted by Rolling Stone and NBC\u2019s The Voice. National acts who have covered her songs include Greensky Bluegrass, Railroad Earth, Sawyer Fredericks (Season 8 winner of The Voice), Joshua Davis (Season 8 finalist of The Voice), Lindsay Lou & The Flatbellys, and others.\n\nErlewine uses her music as a platform for positive change. She considers her job a service-oriented one and carries the torch of the folk singer activist. Her voice on stage encourages connectedness and stresses the importance of environmental advocacy, social justice, creative empowerment and community building as necessary work in our world. May's body of work has become an anthem and an example of why we need to listen to women, and why we need to hear their stories.\n\nMay\u2019s music has touched people all over the world. Her words have held solace for weary hearts, offered a light in the darkness, and held a lot of space for the pain and joy of being alive in these times. When she starts to sing, there\u2019s no way around it: welcome in, everyone.

The dynamic pair are recording/performing artists, songwriters, musicians, audio engineers and producers.\n\nTheir first single, (an out-and-proud Trip Hop style song titled \"#Queen\") has achieved over 50k streams on Spotify and over 25k views on the official music video via YouTube since it's release on October 5th, 2018. Their follow up single (a soft, House track titled \"Can Be Beautiful\") was released on December 21st, 2018, and has since been featured on Billboard Sound and AXS.\n\nStarting a YouTube channel in August of 2013 and making their debut as Elvis Presley's daughter (Lisa Marie Presley)'s supporting act that same year, together they have since begun to take the music world by storm.\n\nThe duo boast a long list of live touring accomplishments and come equipped with a catalog of over 200 original songs. Their outstanding, solid fan base is made up of an array of live audiences, the YouTube community, and social media; where their popularity is ever increasing. Posting covers of both popular and original songs, live performances, v-logs, and behind-the-scenes videos weekly, their YouTube channel has recently reached an impressive tally of over 3 quarter million views overall.\n\nThe sibling duo regularly perform and tour nationally and have frequented venues such as LA's El Rey Theatre, San Juan Capistrano's The Coach House, and (just recently) have played the House of Blues in Anaheim (twice just in 2018), Bar 20 at the Grafton Hotel in Beverly Hills, the Simi Valley fireworks celebration (with over 20,000 people in attendance), at the Gibson theater in Beverly Hills, at Pickwick's Pub in Woodland Hills, a headlining show at Monterey Court in Tucson, AZ, and much more. Nicole & Scotty are currently booking for 2019, and inquiries can be emailed to ulomag28@sbcglobal.net.\n\nThey continuously entertain radio and television appearances; a few of which have included Los Angeles' Hot 103.9 Move to the Music, KHTS 98.1 FM, New York station Gold Star Radio, Las Vegas' 702 ROX, and the TV Entertainment segment Michelle's Corner. Their music is played regularly on a rapidly growing list of stations world wide, proving that the duo are not only rapidly garnering global recognition, but are also vastly appreciated and loved by their fans from all over the world.\n\nThe siblings also dabble in acting; with Scotty having co-starred in an episode of HBO's popular comedy series \"Vice Principals\", which aired October 8th, 2017.\n\nNicole & Scotty have also been featured in several major entertainment publications; including the international music trade magazine, \"Music Connection\" and the entertainment review, \"What's REALLY Going ON\", (where Nicole occasionally writes her own column and where the sister/brother duo were featured front cover in April of 2015).\n\nFrom playing shows with touring musicians who've accompanied major bands and artists (such as The Four Seasons, Barry Manilow,or John Mayer), to garnering attention from well respected industry folks, (such as producer Teddy Riley), making connections and long lasting relationships in the industry are extremely important to Nicole & Scotty.\n\nPerforming for charities and worthy causes they strongly stand for is also a passion of theirs; the siblings having played shows to raise breast cancer awareness, raise funds for youth programs, and entertain schools in the past.\n\nWhen asked, the siblings cite their brand of Pop music as \"current, energetic and brutally honest\". Their sound is indeed uniquely sincere in a genre where it is crucial to uphold the integrity of new and innovative music. The duo delivers just that by stringing raw, personal lyrics through hypnotic hooks and synth layered foundations, accompanied by thrumming bass lines and drum patterns emulating the heartbeat of their own sound. Combining an assortment of authentic Pop arrangements and Trap influence with Electronic Dance beats and rhythms, the duo offer up a wide variety of innovative and well crafted songs that translate deep rooted emotions of every nature to their listeners. As if their artistic thumbprints aren't already present enough in their recordings, a melodic acoustic and the duo's signature ambient electric guitar can be heard flitting in and out of the tunes the pair proudly create and stand by.\n\nNicole, (21), and Scotty, (17), are two young and immensely talented musicians intent on continuing a journey full of song, and wish to share the melodies in their hearts with the world.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jason Isbell & Amanda Shires ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Rock, Country, Folk", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "An acoustic evening celebrating the release of 'Reunions'.

However, it reaches a boiling point on his forthcoming 2018 album, Western Voodoo [Heart of Gold Records].\n\nAt the same time, the Muscle Shoals, AL native stays true to what attracted countless fans in the first place.\n\n\u201cI remain open to anything you would hear coming out of a boombox,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are a lot of different vibes and angles, but it still adheres to a universal rhythm. This new record is the most musical and varied, yet it\u2019s tightly wound in respect to that syncopation. There are only a few rules. It should be heavy groove. It should make you want to move. Overall, I\u2019ve further developed the sound people are used to.\u201d\n\nFollowing up 2016\u2019s fan favorite Bits & Pieces, the artist found himself at something of a crossroads. Longtime collaborator Russ Randolph amicably parted ways with the band at the end of the year. For the first time, Godchaux would solely produce the bulk of a BoomBox record by himself inside of his new studio, while DJ Harry joined on tour in January 2017. Another first, he even performed live bass on the album, opening up the creative palette dramatically.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned more about engineering and the technical aspects of recording. It\u2019s been a time of soul searching. I can follow any Ideas that I want to. So there\u2019s a lot more organic instrumentation. I\u2019m just trying to develop more sonic real.\u201d Appropriately, he dubs the sound of Western Voodoo, \u201cDirty Disco Blues.\u201d Within that realm, Godchaux fuses a funky strut with electronic energy and danceable swagger powerful enough to cast a spell of its own.\n\n\u201cYou hear about different forms of magic around the world,\u201d he goes on. \u201cThe West, in general, has its own voodoo influenced by the blues. That\u2019s what shaped me as a musician growing up in this country. It\u2019s hard to put in the words, but you know it when you hear it.\u201d\n\nYou hear it in everything that BoomBox has done thus far. Over the course of four albums, the group has become a streaming favorite with numerous tracks cracking a million plays on Spotify. Moreover, they\u2019ve made audiences groove everywhere from Electric Forest and Hangout Music Festival to High Sierra Music Festival.\n\nIn the end, the new music kicks off the brightest and boldest chapter yet for Godchaux. \u201cOur best side is somewhat medicinal,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cAll of the rhythms, melodies, and frequencies add up to these healing properties. I hope people feel rejuvenated and re-focused on some level when they hear us.

He began by forcing his friends to watch him perform to records of his dad\u2019s band, Four Saints. Later on, Stephen learned to play the trumpet in various school bands, singing in the choir, and performing in musicals.\n\nInspired by his brother, Scot Evans, and his regional success in the band, Floating Men, Stephen started his own rock band, Mean Season, in the late 80\u2019s where he began honing his songwriting skills on the guitar. After a few years of local success and radio play in Tallahassee, FL, his band moved to Atlanta, GA to try and develop into something bigger. Unfortunately, the band broke up and left Stephen to try his hand at performing solo around Atlanta.\n\nSoon the jammed highways of the big city drove him to the beautiful mountain town of Asheville, NC in 1996, where he quickly began soaking in the creative influence of his amazing surroundings. After many years of vacillating between being a professional musician and being building a nest in Asheville, Stephen is finally focused on his love for creating and performing music.\n\nIn June of 2015, Stephen recruited the True Grits and released the debut CD, \u201cSomething to Bleed\u201d. The True Grits are Brian Shoemaker - bass/lead guitar, Sam Hess - drums, and Woodstock - mandolin, along with special guests Halli Anderson of River Whyless (violin/backing vocals), his brother, Scot Evans of Floating Men (bass on \u20181000 Roses), and his mother, Barbara Evans (backing vocals on \u2018Sound\u2019).\n\n2017 marks the second release of Under the Bridge by Stephen Evans & the True Grits. This EP has 5 songs that range from rock to folk rock and describe an appreciation of Stephen's time in Asheville. Shawn Duxbury, Stephen's former bandmate in Mean Season, is a guest Grit performing lead acoustic guitar on the song 'Waiting'.

A lot has changed in their 20 plus years since the band\u2019s inception but they have always found a way to persist and thrive in todays ever-changing music landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long and adventurous trek\u201d, says Jason Devore (singer/songwriter). The band was formed in Mesa, Arizona by a group of high school friends with ample ambition but no lofty expectations of what the project could become. With the release of their debut album, A Passage in Time (2002, Lava Records), the band\u2019s career gained momentum and they quickly found themselves on the road, touring extensively with acts such as Pennywise, Sum 41, Flogging Molly, H20, and many more. Over the past ten years Authority Zero has gained international acclaim, spending time on the European festival circuit as well as stints in Australia, Russia, Japan. They have released a total of six full length studio albums, many holding spots on Billboard\u2019s Chart and their music has been featured in numerous video games, tv shows, and movie soundtracks. The band\u2019s many successes have been accompanied by a few bumps in the road including a slew of line-up changes, music industry letdowns, as well as having their van, trailer and equipment stolen while on tour in Texas. The secret to their longevity is simple; keep it pure and believe in your music.\n\nNow, 24 years since the band\u2019s inception, the future remains as bright as ever for Authority Zero, consisting of singer Jason DeVore, bassist Mike Spero, guitarist Dan Aid and drummer Chris Dalley. In June of 2018, the guys got back to work at legendary Fort Collins studio, The Blasting Room (Rise Against, Descendents, NOFX) to record their seventh full length album, Persona Non Grata with producer and iconic punk drummer, Bill Stevenson (Black Flag/Descendents/ALL). \u201cThe writing process for recording our new album (Persona Non Grata) was simply awesome. The music and lyrical content came together so organically in such a short amount of time given that our last record, Broadcasting To The Nations, only came out a year ago. Mike, Dan, Chris, and I put our hearts into this one and we are all extremely proud of the work we were able to do as a collective. The music and sound are classic Authority Zero but with a slightly revised approach. For the the fans as well as ourselves we strive to give each record its own individual character and life.\u201d Said DeVore.\n\nThe new album, Persona Non Grata will be Authority Zero\u2019s first self-released studio album and will be available on December 7, 2018. There will be an album release show on December 8th at the Marquee Theater in Tempe, Arizona. The release of Persona Non Grata will be followed by an early spring European Tour in 2019 and a summer headlining tour of the United States.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream Tour 2020 continues May 15th from our home in Arizona!

There is something strangely meditative about the lyrical sunshine-goth he creates with his evolving band in Brooklyn, NY. He attributes much of his creativity to his mother-- a painter and self-proclaimed psychic who remembers the moment she was born. She moved with her son every few years around Europe and the U.S. in hopes to find a new community. When she decided to move once again, this time to devote herself to christianity in Kansas, he decided to go his own way at sixteen years-old.\n\nHNRY FLWR is a songwriter, producer, and crooner. His 7-piece band is like seeing Leonard Cohen fronting The Flaming lips. With spiritualizing synthesizers, guitars, Ringo-esque krautrock drums and HNRY\u2019s pension for jumping into the audience, the live show is cathartic and joyful while somehow staying mysteriously earnest.\n\nIn early 2017, HNRY released two singles that landed him on Deli Magazine\u2019s Best Emerging NYC Psych playlist.

HNRY kept busy that year, playing 40+ shows in NYC and on tour throughout the US. By the time the year was over, the album had gone viral on Spotify with over 500,000 streams.\n\nIn 2018 the success of their breakthrough debut and immersive live shows landed them a tour supporting TEEN in the U.S. and Canada. Locally, The New York Times called them a \u201cbuzzy\u201d band during Color Me Bushwick Festival and as the buzz continued throughout the year they landed support slots with Sunflower Bean, Shy Boys, Renata Zeigur, Grandchildren, Sound of Ceres, Uni, Katie Von Schleicher, and more.

We were standing among guitar amps, drum stands, cymbals, pedals and cases that had been drenched from a faulty ceiling. We saw a heads up penny at the edge of the door and decided to do the best we could to keep our heads up and our spirits high.\nWe have been together for three years since then. In that time we\u2019ve been paying our dues. It\u2019s undoubtedly been work but we\u2019ve had a great time nonetheless. Playing cover shows week in and week out has given us the opportunity to hone our skills as musicians, learn how to run a business and figure out who we are and what we want out of this dream.\nThere\u2019s often a stigma that comes along with being in a cover band. It can be viewed as selling out. In our experience, a cover band can be an effectual incubator for something wildly original. For instance, if you\u2019re a chef, you\u2019re most likely cooking someone else's recipe. If you\u2019re a salesman, you\u2019re most likely selling someone else\u2019s product. If you're a musician (who's making any money), you're most likely playing someone else's music. And just like the chef who can go home and cook a meal inspired by his work and the salesman can go home and successfully convince his kid to eat broccoli, musicians can learn so much from playing other people's music. This is where we find much of the inspiration to create something of our own.\nWe\u2019ve figured out a lot. For one, it IS possible to make a living playing music - even though most won\u2019t suggest it and it\u2019s not easy or glamorous. For two, not having a boss is as good as it sounds. And for three, there\u2019s nothing else we\u2019d rather be doing.\nWe\u2019ve released two EP\u2019s of original music. \u201cWinnebago Soul\u201d came out in 2017 and \u201cOnward and Upward\u201d came out in 2018. Both EP\u2019s are available on all major streaming services. We learned a lot from the creation and production of those ten tunes. But having focused much of our time in the last three years to establish ourselves as a successful cover band, we haven\u2019t focused on original music as much as we would have liked. But now we are collectively ready for a paradigm shift. Of course, we will continue our business as a cover band with the utmost passion and professionalism, but now it is time to also devote serious attention to original music. January 2019 marks the beginning of recording our first full-length album. Our hearts are full and our faith is strong.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed.

Frontman / lyricist Alex Martel and drummer / composer Antoine Lamothe set out to bring their high energy chaotic live performances worldwide, including a recent 2-month US amphitheater and arena tour with Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson, a Japanese tour with Korn, a South American tour with Deftones, as well as several main stage slots on high-profile festivals such as Slipknot\u2019s Knotfest, Vans Warped Tour and Hell & Heaven Fest.\n\nThe band is currently working on new material with producer Michael Beinhorn (Marilyn Manson, Soundgarden), while several songs off its first full-length album, ''Petty'', are available on all streaming services. The album was mixed in Nashville by Vance Powell (Jack White, Arctic Monkeys), mastered by Bob Ludwig (Nirvana, Led Zeppelin) and features Munky from Korn as guest guitarist. On ''Petty'', Deadly Apples explored a more diverse experimental rock and electronic sound, branching off its early industrial metal roots found on their ''Infected'' EP and their collaboration with Ministry / Puscifer's Paul Barker on remixes for ''Fix - The Ministry Movie''.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream: https://www.facebook.com/deadlyapples"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dani Strong ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9975332.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-16", "Genre": "Country, Alt-country, Roots Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dani Strong is a powerful singer/songwriter with a big personality to pair with her depth and charm.
