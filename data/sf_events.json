Cole currently occupies the guitar chair for the David Grisman Quintet and has 2 releases on Grisman\u2019s highly regarded Acoustic Disc Label. George was guitar teacher and mentor to Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt of Green Day for 10 years in the East Bay. Cole, a San Francisco native and BAMMIE award winner brings an expertise to his guitar playing and singing that is filtered through Rock and Roll, Gypsy Jazz and All things American. The music he makes brings to mind the old adage \u201cEverything Old Is New Again\u201d. David Grisman tapped Cole to play on his most recent Sextet record and Cole in turn featured Grisman on his release \u201cGeorge Cole Live\u201d.

His was the sort of upbringing where \u201cif you\u2019re going to do something and you\u2019re not going to do it one-hundred percent you shouldn\u2019t do it all.\u201d It\u2019s why the 25-year-old singer-songwriter treats each song he writes with a painstaking level of dedication, reverence, respect and, as he\u2019ll readily admit, even a bit of obsession. McCollum says that when a particular melody or lyric or emotion is tugging at him, hell, he might just stay in his room for days at a time working it out. He can\u2019t help himself.\n\nThat\u2019s because for the Austin-based singer and multi-instrumentalist the end result is worth the occasional pain in the process. \u201cThat\u2019s where I find my identity,\u201d McCollum, who broke out with the revealing and critically adored 2013 debut The Limestone Kid and now returns with his highly anticipated follow-up album, Probably Wrong, says of penning soul-baring, honest and forthright Americana anthems. \u201cIt just takes over,\u201d he says of the songwriting muse and, one senses, his ever-winding, sometimes gut-wrenching journey as an introspective musician.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t choose this life. It chose me.\u201c\n\nSet for release on November 10 independently, Probably Wrong, pulls back the curtain and reveals McCollum like never before. The 10-track LP, written after the dissolution of a long-term relationship, is equal parts introspective, self-flagellating and transcendent. It\u2019s also the most honest McCollum has ever been in song. There\u2019s an inherent pain that bleeds through in the raw honesty of stunning songs including \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d and \u201cHell of a Year.\u201d For McCollum, putting his most intimate thoughts and feelings to song is more of a welcome relief than an act of bloodletting. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about my feelings very often,\u201d he notes. \u201cI keep a lot of things in most of the time and I don\u2019t want anybody else to have to deal with my shit. I just write songs instead.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of The Limestone Kid\u2019s release, and its lead single \u201cMeet Me in the Middle\u201d finding success at regional radio, McCollum says \u201cin the blink of an eye\u201d his life drastically changed.\u201d The then-22-year-old went from a life of smoking pot on his couch and passing his days strumming the guitar to traveling from one gig to the next not as a nobody but rather a revered traveling musician with a fervent fanbase. McCollum always wanted to be a singer-songwriter but he admits he was caught a bit off guard by the buzz around Limestone. \u201cI was playing catch up for two years,\u201d he says.\n\nIn speaking with McCollum, it\u2019s easy to detect the sense of wonderment and romance he still attaches to the brutally honest songwriters he first revered during his teenage years. Men like Townes Van Zandt, Todd Snider, Steve Earle and James McMurtry \u2014 even as a wide-eyed and innocent young man, McCollum sensed these musicians were speaking to a more powerful truth. \u201cIt would jerk my soul out of me,\u201d he says of encountering and quickly becoming enamored with their music and subsequently dedicating his life to molding songs of a similarly revealing bent. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I\u2019ve ever encountered that has had as much influence on me,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted to listen to. It was my thing.\u201d\n\nTo that end, when he began writing the songs that would ultimately comprise Probably Wrong, McCollum felt it necessary to be alone with little more than his emotions and a guitar. \u201cI needed to write this record and be on my own,\u201d he says of what led him to end a two-year relationship and retreat inward. \u201cI felt very misunderstood throughout the entire situation,\u201d he adds. \u201cI broke my own heart for the first time just to write this record.\u201d For six weeks, McCollum did nothing but stare at a piece of paper filled with soul-crushing lyrics and engage with his sadness. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a sad person,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cBut I had done it to myself intentionally.\u201d\n\nThe pain still lingers, but McCollum says accessing it to write his new album allowed him to pen some of his most poignant material to date. \u201cHell of a Year,\u201d which he calls his \u201csleeper favorite of the record,\u201d came from McCollum breaking down one night in his truck in a fast-food parking lot. \u201cMy heart\u2019s out of love/I fell out of line/I swore I\u2019d never leave again/And I lied,\u201d he sings over a gentle acoustic guitar figure. \u201cWhen I set out to write this record this was the type of song I was gunning for,\u201d he says of \u201cHell of a Year.\u201d \u201cIt was the hardest song I\u2019ve ever written as far as being that honest. But after doing so I could go back to being happy for a little bit.\u201d On the slow rolling \u201cMisunderstood,\u201d the singer throws his hands in the air and makes peace with what he can\u2019t control. \u201cYou told me I was no good/It\u2019s alright babe/I\u2019m pretty used to being misunderstood.\u201d\n\nSinging such soul-baring songs is a decidedly therapeutic act for McCollum. \u201cWhen the melody is so spot-on and it hooks me everything that I have been bottling up or not talking about comes out.\u201d It\u2019s why the singer says he lives to perform. \u201cNext to the songwriting the live show is most important,\u201d he offers. Though, seeing as many of his gigs are rowdy, upbeat affairs, he says he searches for the right moments to pepper his set with more emotional numbers. \u201cI\u2019m constantly trying to find ways to make our live show better,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cAnd my confidence level keeps going up and up. Most of the time onstage I\u2019m running around like I\u2019m the man,\u201d he adds with a laugh, \u201cbut I\u2019m definitely not.\u201d\n\nThe goal going forward then, McCollum insists, is to never remain stagnant. He idolizes musicians like John Mayer whom he says are always redefining their creativity. He intends to do the same. \u201cMy goal is to totally evolve and reinvent myself with each record I make,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cIt\u2019s about changing with each record and really not giving a shit. And if you can pull that off, well, that\u2019s a pretty special thing.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Snotty Nose Rez Kids ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10068195.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Tue Apr 14 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-14", "Genre": "Rap, Indigenous Hip-hop, Hip Hop, Trap, Hip-hop", "Time": "2:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Starline Social Club", "moreBioInfo": "Snotty Nose Rez Kids is a Haisla Hip-Hop duo from Kitimat, BC, composed of rappers Yung Trybez & Young D.

The two have gone from sleepy English steel town obscurity to craft-smiths ready to make a global impact.\n\nInspired by their music aficionado father who raised the duo on a steady diet of The Rolling Stones and The Everly Brothers, the two would rehearse in the family kitchen while scrounging for gigs in their blue-collar hometown of Scunthorpe, England. Laughs Rupert, \u201cWe\u2019d walk into pubs and clubs as kids and ask the owner if we could play something for the local drunks at 2pm.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until a move to London and the success of their track \u201cAces,\u201d a song recorded in their studio apartment, that the boys from Scunthorpe went from pub performers to BBC radio staples.\n\nThe brothers quickly collected a global audience of fans, none more influential than iconic producer Rick Rubin, who quickly recognized their talent and promptly took the brothers under his wing. \u201cI liked that their songwriting seemed like it was from another era,\u201d explains Rubin. \u201cIt\u2019s making something new again with these traditional influences.\u201d Henry adds, \u201cThe album was recorded using all real instruments and a live band, resulting in a different sound than what\u2019s present in much of today\u2019s popular music.\u201d Adds Rupert of the collaboration, \u201cIt was incredibly exciting - he\u2019s worked with some of our favorite artists of all time and is such a versatile producer. He helped us recognize the strength of Henry and I playing and singing together; it was a foundation to build upon and the guidance we needed.\u201d\n\nThe brothers\u2019 artistic background and pedigree come into full focus on their debut studio album ALL MY SHADES OF BLUE (out 6/01 via Ramseur), produced by Rubin and featuring Henry on acoustic guitar and Rupert on electric and acoustic guitar, harmonica, and bass. The album also includes the talents of such boldface names as Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on drums, along with The Killers\u2019 Dave Keuning on strings and Faces and Small Faces legend Ian McLagan on keyboards. The record features both music and lyrics written by the boys throughout their improbable journey. Says Rupert, speaking about both the album and the duo\u2019s entire career, \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky in the sense that we\u2019ve been able to do whatever we\u2019ve wanted musically and had it all recorded to the best quality with the best musicians and collaborators.

The talent he showed as a youth led his father to send him to study in the US, where he won scholarships in classical piano at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia under the tutelage of concert pianist Susan Starr and in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music where he studied with Harold Danko. While a student in his teens, Simon performed with Philly guitarist Kevin Eubanks and saxophonist Greg Osby.\nSettling in New York City in 1989, he performed with many jazz masters, including Herbie Mann, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Watson, Terence Blanchard, Jerry Gonzalez and The Fort Apache Band, Arturo Sandoval, Many Oquendo and Libre and Don Byron. Simon quickly discovered that if he wanted to use jazz as a medium of expression he needed to immerse himself in this tradition. Membership in Bobby Watson's influential group Horizon (1989-94) and the Terence Blanchard Group (1994-2002) were instrumental to this end during his formative years. The experience of playing with Paquito D'Rivera proved to be pivotal, as it sparked an interest in the music of his native country.\nSimon made his first recording as a leader in 1994 (Beauty Within, on Audioquest), giving birth to the Edward Simon Trio. That same year he became a Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition finalist. Since then he has written extensively for the trio, using it as a platform for other projects and developing his unique compositional voice. In 1995 Edward received his first commission and composed Rumba Neurotica for the Relache Ensemble.\nIn recognition of his distinctive accomplishments, Chamber Music America awarded Edward Simon the New Works: Creation and Presentation grant to compose the Venezuelan Suite. In recognition for his outstanding work in jazz composition. In 2005, he received a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship. Simon has served as adjunct faculty at the University of the Arts and continues to teach clinics, seminars and workshops at music schools and universities around the world. Currently, he serves as adjunct faculty at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music in New York City. Simon has participated on more than forty recordings, including several Grammy nominated albums, lead by jazz greats such as Terence Blanchard, John Patitucci, Bobby Watson, and Herbie Mann among others and numerous soundtracks. He has produced eleven critically acclaimed albums as a leader including two New York Times Top Ten jazz records of the year: Edward Simon (Kokopelli, 1994) and Simplicitas (Criss Cross, 2005). Today, Simon keeps himself busy writing for and leading his trio, Ensemble Venezuela, Afinidad - a quartet co-lead with long time collaborator saxophonist David Binney and Simon, Simon & Simon, a project co-lead with his two brothers.

Couple that with all their music friends joining in on the fun, and this new CD makes a very strong case for Northern California being the new torch-bearing center of the classic Chicago and Texas blues sound.\nSix stellar originals tell the couple\u2019s individual and combined personal histories in an honest and cosmic way. Beth & RW\u2019s love of the classic blues vibe pays off and yet, these songs could easily be covered by well-known singers in many roots music idioms.\nNestled alongside are songs by their mid-20th century heroes Jimmy Reed (lead track, \u201cThere\u2019ll Be a Day\u201d, \u201cAin\u2019t That Loving You Baby\u201d), Memphis Minnie (\u201cLookin\u2019 the World Over\u201d), Big Bill Broonzy (\u201cLonesome Road Blues\u201d), jump blues brother-sister act, Buddy & Ella Johnson (\u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Stop It\u201d) and Memphis Slim (\u201cMother Earth.\u201d)\nRed\u2019s Blues has a finger-poppin\u2019 attitude\u2014straight outta the afore-mentioned golden years when blues, R&B and swing all meshed together and dance floors every night were filled with snake hips and slow drags. Beth, with her sensual, southern voice and classy behind-the-beat phrasing is more a Julie London or Bobbie Gentry-styled singer: smoky with languid, sexy sophistication. She can swing too, just check out the big fun on \u201cWhy Don\u2019t Ya Stop It.\u201d This rich nightclub feel is missed on too many modern singers. The yearning confidentiality, the wise heart that Beth brings to her true-life stories reveal tales of youth seen through grown up reflection.\nRW, who has not lost his hometown Rome, Georgia accent has this quality also. Upright bass never had a better companion\u2014it\u2019s no wonder that RW has anchored the doghouse rhythm for Mark Hummel\u2019s legendary Harmonica Blowouts for ten years. Together, Beth & RW have a rare and beautiful combination of poetry, humor and groove in their music. What other couple in more recent music memory had this? Could they be the blues Sonny & Cher? Johnny & June? Whether up-tempo or ballad, this makes for a great live show \u2014part juke joint, part nightclub. They are uptown and lowdown.\nTheir friends on this release are California harp masters Rick Estrin and Mark Hummel, Texas guitar masters Anson Funderburgh and Mike Keller, Texas drummer and RW Grigsby\u2019s childhood music sidekick, Wes Starr (the dazzling team from Hummel\u2019s Golden State-Lone Star Revue) guitarist and harmonica player Dave Earl and two Sacramento Hall of Famers, guitarists Robert Sidwell and Steve Randall.\nVeteran Bay Area Musician Dave Earl, now living in the Sierra foothills, played guitar and rack harmonica in Red\u2019s Blues for two years. \u201cDoug Crumpacker of Hucklebucks reknown, is currently Red\u2019s Blues\u2019 guitar player. When we have another guitar player on stage with us, he knows when to drop back and support the other artist. He\u2019s a fine addition to our band and is up there with the best. Also a great part of our rhythm section is Tim Wilbur, Sacramento\u2019s own shuffle king.\u201d Doug, Tim and RW are all members of the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame.\nDrummer/studio owner/engineer Larry Carr understands the great 1950s Chicago drummers like Jimmy Reed\u2019s great shuffle drummer Earl Phillips. He also has a terrific beatnik bongo/shakers turn on one of the album highlights, \u201cI\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)\u201d penned by RW. If Robert Mitchum were still around, THIS 2-minute warning would absolutely be his theme song.\nYoung Hammond B-3 lions are here too. James Pace (Tommy Castro) and Kid Andersen (award-winning blues producer; and formerly with Terry Hanck, Charlie Musselwhite, now Rick Estrin & The Nightcats), and John Cocuzzi all take turns and elegant swingman Cocuzzi adds his deep blues piano touch on three songs.\nIt is always good to know what the artists themselves want to say about each song choice they carefully made and the originals they wrote:\n1. There\u2019ll Be A Day- the flip side of Jimmy Reed\u2019s 1963 hit \u201cShame, Shame, Shame.\u201d Original 3rd verse written by Beth contains the album title You Knock Me Out.\n2. Poor Girl- inspired by RW and Beth\u2019s time managing a ghetto bingo hall in Montgomery, Alabama and a girl with a gambling problem.\n3. Lookin\u2019 The World Over- Memphis Minnie\u2019s tale of travels with her righteous man. Killer Estrin harp solo.\n4. That\u2019s All- written after Beth found a picture of her mother\u2019s. A family tale of living, loving and dying.\n5. Ain\u2019t That Loving You Baby- Jimmy Reed cover features Mark Hummel on harp and the Golden State Lone Star Revue.\n6. Baby Walk On- RW original inspired by Mose Allison. Solos by Hummel, Mike Keller and Anson Funderburgh.\n7. Stonebroke- originally recorded in 1992 with RW on Gary Primich\u2019s My Pleasure on Austin\u2019s Amazing Records. Rick Estrin plays some fine solos. A Primich original.\n8. Why Don\u2019t You Stop It- Buddy and Ella Johnson tune, Lou Ann Barton used to sing this with Roomful of Blues.\n9. Pat\u2019s Blues-Original tune about our friend who went on a binge and woke up with a stranger who\u2019s name she didn\u2019t know....yep it\u2019s true. Only we changed it to a tune about our friend, a guy, because it didn\u2019t sound right, Beth singing about a girl.....)\n10. Lonesome Road Blues- Big Bill Broonzy road tune.\n11. I\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)- RW original, Larry Carr on bongos, hillbilly beatnik.\n12. Somewhere Down The Line- Another RW&B original, trying to channel the feel of south Louisiana in this song of reconciliation. Nice soloing from John Cocuzzi and Steve Randall. Another family tale.\n13. Mother Earth- Memphis Slim cover brings it all home. Solos by John Cocuzzi and Robert Sidwell. On a Blues Cruise in 2012, Barrelhouse Chuck asked Beth if she knew \u201cMother Earth.\u201d She said \u201cno, but I know Blues is Everywhere.\u201d He said, \u201cI love your voice. Learn that song.\u201d So she did\u2014\"never got to sing it with him, though. I was glad RW thought of putting it on the CD.\u201d\n\nA little more Beth & RW back story:\nBeth, thanks to her older brother, grew up listening to Huddie Ledbetter, Muddy Waters and Mississippi John Hurt records and as a kid, learned from and sang songs at home with her Mom-- \u201c Summertime,\u201d \u201cGod Bless the Child,\u201d and St. Louis Blues.\u201d Across the street in her hometown of south Santa Barbara though, the shy 7 year old redhead was bold enough to go perch on the neighbor\u2019s porch listening to a Cuban salsa band rehearse, and from that learned to love the rhythms, the bass and percussion in particular. She and RW met through the local Santa Barbara blues scene years later in 1977, and have lived in his home state of Georgia and then Texas before heading back to sunny Sacramento, California in 2006.\n2014 Grammy-nominated and Blues Music Award (BMA) winner bassist RW Grigsby has been playing since he was 14 years old, and began his professional career when still a teenager. He's toured the U.S., Canada and Europe since the '80s, and currently juggles playing with Red's Blues, Mark Hummel and the Blues Survivors and The Golden State/Lone Star Blues Revue. He played and recorded with Texas blues stars Gary Primich and Black Top Records\u2019 Mike Morgan and the Crawl in the 1990s. RW is the bassist on the 2014 Grammy-nominated and BMA-winning CD, Remembering Little Walter. He was nominated for a BMA \u201cBest Bassist\u201d Award in 2017, and was inducted into the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame in 2018.\nRed\u2019s Blues draw their audiences into a grown-up music world\u2014southern music with downhome simmer, dance floor fun and stellar, sophisticated players who know they have no need to blast at earsplitting volumes to make the biggest impact.\n\u2013 Bio by Mindy Giles, \u00a9 2018\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/redsbluessac\n(916) 342-4281 bethgrigsby@comcast.net", "otherInfo": "Red\u2019s Blues is back at the lovely Empress Lounge.

On That\u2019s What I Heard, Robert celebrates the music of Curtis Mayfield, Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland, The Sensational Nightingales and more, alongside four newly written songs. Listen to the first single \u201cAnything You Want\u201d here (by Robert Cray), available now on all streaming services.\n\nCray and Jordan go way back, having met during the making of the Chuck Berry documentary Hail! Hail! Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll, in 1987. They started working together in 1999, when Jordan produced the Grammy-winning Take Your Shoes Off, and the recent Grammy-nominated LP, Robert Cray & Hi Rhythm. That\u2019s What I Heard is their sixth album. \u201cOnce you start working with Steve, it\u2019s kind of hard to get away from him,\u201d said Robert.\n\nThe music on That\u2019s What I Heard falls into two camps, the sweet and the funky. Of the former, \u201cYou\u2019re the One\u201d comes from the Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland songbook. \u201cThere\u2019s this thing where I feel you kind of gotta get out of your own head when you're covering one of your heroes,\u201d Cray explained. \u201cBobby\u2019s one of those. You just let yourself go, and do the song because you love it.\u201d\n\nDon Gardner\u2019s \u201cMy Baby Likes to Boogaloo\u201d and the Billy Sha-Rae minor hit, \u201cDo It\u201d are acknowledged rarities (the originals can be heard on the compilation, Groove & Grind: Rare Soul). \u201cDo It\u201d is leaner and meaner, the sort of bare-bones funk that defined the Detroit club sound in the early \u201970s with Sha-Rae, Dennis Coffey, and Earl Van Dyke. Cray\u2019s steamroller rendition gets a little extra push from guest guitarist Ray Parker, Jr., who played in Sha-Rae\u2019s band as a teen.\n\n\u201cBurying Ground\u201d is a sacred song from the Sensational Nightingales, inspired by Cray\u2019s youth, when Sundays on the stereo were reserved for his parents\u2019 gospel records. Curtis Mayfield wrote \u201cYou\u2019ll Want Me Back\u201d for Major Lance, and Cray wrote \u201cTo Be with You\u201d for his late friend, Tony Joe White. \u201cHot\u201d is another Cray original. \u201cAs for the lyrics, \u201cWe always say to ourselves, \u2018I\u2019m old, but I\u2019m hot,\u2019\u201d he said, and laughed. Spotted hanging around the studio, Steve Perry sang harmony vocals on \u201cPromises You Can\u2019t Keep,\u201d written by Steve Jordan, Kim Wilson and Danny Kortchmar.\n\n\u201cRobert is just a great person besides being extraordinary talent,\u201d adds Jordan. \u201cPeople gravitate to his guitar playing first, but I think he\u2019s one of the best singers I\u2019ve heard in my life. Not only because of his singing ability, but his interpretations. He\u2019s such an honest soul in my opinion.\u201d\n\nRobert\u2019s band features Richard Cousins (bass), Dover Weinberg (keyboards), Terence F.

Their eighth full-length is a collection of ruthlessly melodic and irresistibly compelling progressive folk metal that will immediately resonate with any who have followed the band at any point over the two decades of their storied career. \"Being so close to the album, it's almost impossible for us in the band to have an objective opinion about it, but my impression is that it's a more diverse collection that's also more extreme in some ways. There are more instrumental passages than on 'Valkyrja' (2013), and there are a lot of guitar and bass details,\" states guitarist/vocalist Heri Joensen. \"I really feel we've realized the vision we set out to create all those years ago, and as I listen through the album, I am satisfied with every aspect: the epicness, the intricacy, the melodies and harmonies, and the sheer heaviness of it. I love the whole atmosphere of it.\"\n\nKnown for their prolific nature - dropping their first five full-lengths in the space of just seven years - the six-year gap between Valkyrja and Hel is by far the longest between any two of their records. During that period the band toured hard, taking the album around the world, including a support run with Children Of Bodom in North America and an appearance on the 70,000 Tons Of Metal cruise. However, other factors played into this extended break between releases. \"We approached this one differently because I learned that if I continue doing albums in the way we had up to now, I would die from a heart attack before I'm 50!\" says Joensen. \"That's one of the reasons we changed our method and took such a long time on this one.\" That this tactic - which also includes more songwriting contributions from bassist/vocalist Gunnar Thomsen and guitarist Terji Skiben\u00e6s than on previous releases - has been beneficial is borne out in the finished product, which is perhaps more immersive than those that came before. \"Musically it leans a bit towards our album, 'Ragnarok' (2005),\" states Thomsen. \"It's a bit more epic and also much better worked through than any of our previous albums.\" It also marks the recording debut of drummer Tadeusz Rieckmann, who has manned the drum throne for T\u00fdr's live shows since 2016. \"We had some problems finding the right guy some years back, but Tadeusz is the man for the job,\" says Joensen. \"He's a very technically able drummer, but at the same time, he has a very natural old-school heaviness to his style, and he plays with deep emotion, which is just what we need.\"\n\nConceptually, the album is informed by a combination of mythology, personal experience and observations of current international events, making for a multifaceted experience that can be processed and understood on many levels. Starting not with a specific story to tell but with an atmosphere in mind, Joensen prefers not to disclose too much detail when it comes to lyrics, keen for listeners to have a chance to take what they want from the songs, though he provides a basic description of that which inspired him. \"Hel is the realm of death in Norse mythology, the underworld where those who die a natural death, not in battle, go. A bit confusingly, it is also the name of the goddess who rules over the same realm. She's the daughter of Loki and a terrifying creature to look upon.\" Two of the songs - \"Ragnars Kv\u00e6\u00f5i\" and \"\u00c1lvur Kongur\" - are traditional Faroese ballads and are as such sung in Joensen's native tongue. Followers of T\u00fdr will be aware that they have on numerous occasions strayed from English, which Joensen acknowledges as the \"language of metal\", though this time out it is only the ballads that feature non-English lyrics. \"If I have a good folky melody, I always have the thought that I should write the lyrics in Faroese, but I seldom have the time. The traditional songs come with lyrics, so it's just about picking out the verses I want to use.\" These tracks were in actuality selected even before the release of Valkyrja and have had a long gestation period, Joensen feeling that in adapting them they very much fit with the band's signature sound. \"I am always trying out melodies and chose 'Ragnars Kv\u00e6\u00f0i' first for the fascinating melody in the chorus, and secondly for the storyline. The other ballad I picked first because of the lyrics, which refer to Odin extensively, and secondly for the melody and chorus. I was very satisfied with the harmonies and epic feel of the arrangements I'd come up with, and to tell you the truth, I wish there were more songs of this kind on the album.\"\n\nHel was tracked entirely by Thomsen and Joensen, with sessions split between the latter's studio in S\u00f8ldarfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur, drums lain down at Jacob Hansen's studio in Denmark, Skiben\u00e6s working in his home studio, and some solos and bass details recorded while they were on the road in North America. \"The sessions took us a long time because we did it all on our own. But we gathered a lot of knowhow while doing it, so it will be a good reference for the future,\" states Thomsen. Joensen concurs, adding, \"It was a bit more relaxing than usual, which was good for me. It took some discipline, and creative people are not typically the most disciplined types. I am definitely not, so I guess it could have gone faster with someone else at the whip!\" That the delay in getting the record out means it's emerging in the twentieth year of T\u00fdr's existence is quite poignant. It has definitely not been an easy road to this point, with several members having come and gone, and those that remain having had to endure some very difficult periods, but despite all of it, they have managed to make it through, and achieved a great deal in the process. \"I did dream about becoming an internationally successful professional when I started. It's what I aimed at, but still it's a bit surreal that we've made it this far,\" Joensen admits. \"I didn't in my wildest dreams think I could put survive such misery and abject poverty that this career has lead me through. Still, here I am.\" Thomsen \"could not be prouder\" when he looks back at the string of records they have released, also acknowledging the ups and downs experienced along the way, but making an important point: \"We've done something nobody from where we're from has done before,\" he states plainly. \"But there's a lot more to come!\"\n\nKeep up to date with T\u00ddR at the following locations:\nhttp://www.tyr.fo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tyrband\nhttps://twitter.com/tyrband\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tyr_official\nhttps://www.youtube.com/tyrband\n\n\nBand History:\nProfession of the Christian Faith or Decapitation: This was the choice given by Sigmundur to his Faroese Viking compatriot Tr\u00f3ndur \u00ed G\u00f8tu. And so it was that in 999 A.D., the Christianization of the small \u201cFaeroe Islands\u201d began, casting a veil of oblivion over the ancient Scandinavian gods and only leaving the relics of forgotten heathenry buried deep within the Christian ritual. Or so it was believed...\n\nExactly 999 years later, a small group fondly remembering the archaic gods and rites came together to form the Faroese Viking metal band, T\u00ddR. The one-armed God of War \u2014the bravest of all\u2014 became the eponym of the Nordic quartet. Yet T\u00ddR mastermind Heri Joensen is no war monger in disguise and points out that T\u00ddR (also known as the God of Justice) is also revered for first seeking the avenues of diplomacy\u2014an attribute that does not take away from this god of war\u2019s drive.\n\nA distinctive trademark that sets T\u00ddR apart from most other bands of the Viking metal genre is the authenticity of their music: \u201cTraditional music dating back to the Vikings, that is not preserved anywhere else in the world, not even in Iceland, is passed on in an oral tradition here and it is still alive and well. That is what we build our music on and draw great inspiration from,\u201d explains Joensen.\n\nAlmost every song is based on Faroese or Norwegian lore, and is riveted in the garb of the folk metal genre. Its approach unmistakably creates very true Viking metal.\n\nFollowing the release of a demo, the \u00d3lavur Riddararos single, full-length How Far to Asgard, six years of innumerable gigs, and several domestic television appearances, T\u00ddR\u2019s second full-length Eric the Red became the Islands\u2019 best-selling album, coming to the attention of Napalm Records, the label that finally made the album available worldwide in 2006.\n\nImmediately, the unique approach of T\u00ddR\u00b4s music, melting traditional Nordic songs and dances with Celtic influences, doom, heavy, and progressive metal found fans around the globe. \u201cHail to The Hammer\u201d became the hymn to the new generation of folk, pagan, and Viking metal fans.\n\nIn late 2006, T\u00ddR refined their trademark sound with Ragnarok. Technically brilliant and 100 percent authentic, Ragnarok was nothing less than a masterpiece within the true Viking metal genre. The Faroese band embarked on a European tour with Die Apokalyptischen Reiter and a few months later with AMON AMARTH. Though musically different, T\u00ddR gained legions of new fans, impressed by the four men on stage, who were able to turn every show into a demonstration of musical prowess.\n\nFestival appearances throughout Europe and continued touring followed until T\u00ddR enjoyed their biggest live triumph ever at the very over-crowded Wet Stage in Wacken.\n\nLand was released in 2008 and proved to be yet another milestone in the band\u2019s career. Traditional Faroese lyrics marked tracks such as \u201cG\u00e1tu R\u00edma,\u201d \u201cF\u00edpan Fagra\u201d and \u201cLokka T\u00e1ttur,\u201d and \u201cGandkv\u00e6\u00f0i Tr\u00f3ndar,\u201d which is a poem by J.H.O. Djurhuus about the Faroese chieftain Tr\u00f3ndur, who fought against the dying of the old beliefs and for the independence of the Faeroes. A video clip was produced to the fan favorite \u201cSinklars V\u00edsa.\u201d Land received overwhelming positive feedback and a new audience was able to experience the power of T\u00ddR for the first time.\n\nFollowing the release of Land, T\u00ddR embarked on numerous tours through Europe. One of the highlights was without a doubt the Aaskereia Festival tour with then label-mates Alestorm and Hollenthon. Thanks to their efforts, the band reached many new fans with their memorable concerts. 2008 ended with T\u00ddR being nominated as \u201cBand of the Year\u201d by the Faroese National TV and radio. However, the band had no time to rest on its laurels and embarked on yet another tour through North America in the spring of 2009.\n\nDespite their busy touring schedule, T\u00ddR worked on new songs recorded in early 2009. The band chose to produce the album on native soil. Jacob Hansen mixed the new material with finishing touches provided by the mastering experts at Finnvox. By the Light of the Northern Star met with great feedback from fans and critics alike. The new anthem \u201cHold the Heathen Hammer High\u201c was regarded as the legitimate successor to \u201cHail to the Hammer.\u201d After the release of the album By the Light of the Northern Star, the band played numerous concerts and festivals, as well as taking part in the 70.000 Tons of Metal cruise, while still finding the time to work on new material for their upcoming release.\n\nThe story of King Thrym, who dared steal Thor\u00b4s hammer \"Mjollnir,\" may set the lyrical stage on T\u00ddR's latest album, but it does not prevent them from covering more current topics like in the track \"Shadow of the Swastika.\" The Lay of Thrym follows the path of the band's previous releases by uniting classic heavy metal riffs with impressive drumming, traditional melodies, and powerful choruses. The result is a number of epic anthems, such as \"Take Your T\u00ddRant\" and \"Hall of Freedom,\" both of which will most certainly earn a permanent spot on T\u00ddR's future set lists. Frontman Heri Joensen continues to give T\u00ddR a unique and unmistakable edge with magnificent vocals and superb guitar work. Jacob Hansen was again responsible for recording, mixing, and mastering the album, complementing this fascinating Faeroese sound universe with finishing touches that allow every last detail to shine. The Lay of Thrym is a genuine Viking metal album that will undoubtedly secure T\u00ddR's hold on this genre with its heroic melodies and glorious riffs.\n\nValkyrja, the 7 full-length album from the Faroe Islands natives T\u00ddR, is a concept album with a story line based loosely around an nameless Viking age warrior who leaves his woman and goes off to impress the Valkyrie on the battlefield so that she may bring him to Valhalla, or to F\u00f3lkvangr, the home of Freyja\u2014the goddess associated with love, sexuality, beauty, fertility, gold, sorcery, war, and death. One can say the album is also indirectly about women and how they affect men and what men will do to impress and obtain women. Frontman and founder Heri Joensen goes on to explain; \u201cthe woman that the warrior leaves may represent the earthly women. Freyja, The Lady Of The Slain, may represent the perfection of Women, and the Valkyrie is the link between the two, taking men from earthly to godly women.\u201d\n\nRecorded at Hansen Studios in Ribe, Denmark with Jacob Hansen who handled production, mixing and mastering, the band began writing guitars and drums for Valkyrja over a year ago with melody lines and arrangements being handled in the studio. \u201cI had the story outline and approximate titles very early in the writing process, but only very late, maybe almost too late, did I write the actual lyrics,\u201d comments Heri Joensen. The band\u2019s drummer, K\u00e1ri Streymoy, parted ways with T\u00ddR after the band completed their US run on Pagan Fest and before they entered the studio so T\u00ddR enlisted George Kollias who stepped in to handle recording duties on Valkyrja. In terms of what the band hopes fans take away from the album, bassist Gunnar H. Thomsen states \u201cI hope they will enjoy it and they like the new direction as well as (guitarist) Terji's bigger involvement in writing and George's drumming. We had a more upbeat direction without changing T\u00ddR's style.\u201d\n\nDiscography:\n\u00d3lavur Riddararos (2002)\nHow Far to Asgard (2002)\nEric the Red (2003)\nEric the Red re-released (2006)\nRagnarok (2006)\nLand (2008)\nHow Far to Asgard re-released (2008)\nBy the Light of the Northern Star (2009)\nThe Lay of Thrym (2011)\nValkyrja (2013)\nHel (2019)", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "MH The Verb ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8037746.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463, 37.7648], "Date": "Thu Apr 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-16", "Genre": "[Multi-Media Hip Hop Artist], MH the Verb", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Sofar Sounds", "moreBioInfo": "I am a whiskey drinking, boat shoe wearing, MC/DJ/Producer who currently resides on a Megabus between a pair of imitation BeatsbyDre Headphones.

Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "500 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Sonam\u00f3 ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9317059.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.437364, 37.774222], "Date": "Thu Apr 16 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-16", "Genre": "Acid Jazz, Funk", "Time": "4:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Madrone Art Bar", "moreBioInfo": "If Jamiroquai and Stevie Wonder were Italians, they would sound like Sonam\u00f3.\n\nWith a dynamic, passionate blend of melodic lines shot through with hefty doses of R&B, funk, and acid jazz, Sonam\u00f3 music is both danceable yet introspective, at once familiar yet exotic, intense yet energetic, romantic and yet somehow carefree.

There, Schneider began to develop her personal way of writing for what would become her 18-member collective, made up of many of the finest musicians in jazz today, tailoring her compositions to distinctly highlight the uniquely creative voices of the group. The Maria Schneider Orchestra has performed at festivals and concert halls worldwide. She herself has received numerous commissions and guest-conducting invites, working with over 90 groups in over 30 countries.\n\nSchneider\u2019s music blurs the lines between genres, making her long list of commissioners quite varied, stretching from Jazz at Lincoln Center, to The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, to collaborating with David Bowie.

She\u2019s been awarded many honors by the Jazz Journalists Association and DOWNBEAT and JAZZTIMES Critics and Readers Polls. In 2012, her alma mater, the University of Minnesota, presented Schneider with an honorary doctorate. ASCAP awarded her their esteemed Concert Music Award in 2014.

Pool had carved out a unique place for himself in the bass music community; performing under the moniker of SPL for over 10 years and releasing drum & bass, dubstep, and trap-oriented music on respected labels such as Barcode, Tech Itch, Evol Intent, Sub Human, Rottunn, and SMOG Recordings. SPL\u2019s music was fully immersed in sound design, a musical landscape comprised of melodic, dark, and refined touches. By the Summer of 2014, Pool came to the realization that he had pushed the SPL project to its sonic boundaries and in order to evolve musically, he would need a new project to explore lighter textures and richer melodies. Rooted in jungle and bass music and built around elements of blippy 8-bit sounds, arpeggios, and lush 80s synths, Champagne Drip launched as a decidedly tropical and uplifting sounding project. Operating at first in anonymity, Champagne Drip made a big splash thru the release of official remixes of Bassnectar (Amorphous Music) and Elliphant (Mad Decent). Shortly thereafter, he released his debut EP \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d on Mad Decent in September of 2014. Over the first year of the project\u2019s history, press outlets were fascinated with the unique sound, but also with uncovering the identity of the secretive producer behind the music. \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d was subsequently remixed by electronic upstarts Big Wild, Lazerdisk, Mayhem, and Son of Kick and released in the Spring of 2015 as \u201cRemix Bikini\u201d. In the Fall of 2015, Champagne Drip released his 2nd EP for Mad Decent, \u201cJourney Into The Champagne Sea\u201d. Whereas his first EP explored more overtly tropical overtones, \u201cJourney\u201d went into deeper and darker musical territory. After spending one full year refining his sound in the studio, he finally revealed himself as the former SPL in 2016; performing across the US at such festivals as Mysteryland, WTFest?, Imagine, Enchanted Forest, and Lights All Night. Building up anticipation for his next original recordings, Champagne Drip released the stand alone single \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d, which was featured on the official Bernie Sanders Presidential campaign fundraising compilation \u201cRave4Bernie\u201d. Official remixes for Grandtheft (Mad Decent), Cardinox (Warner Brothers), and Dillon Francis & NGHTMRE (Mad Decent) followed.

Driven and inspired by the thriving music scene of his hometown which includes such greats as Professor Longhair, Doctor John and The Meters, Moore\u2019s name is now mentioned amongst these Big Easy mainstays.\n\nIn the early \u201890s, Moore helped found the New Orleans-based essential funk band Galactic. Their first album, 1996\u2019s widely acclaimed Coolin\u2019 Off, led to an intense tour schedule of nearly 200 gigs a year for the next ten years. Building on their fan base by adding an esteemed list of all-star collaborations to the six albums that followed, Galactic continues to amass a worldwide audience via recording and touring globally.\n\nMoore launched his solo career in 1998 aided by eight-string guitar virtuoso Charlie Hunter and saxophonist Skerik (Les Claypool, John Scofield, Roger Waters). The group recorded All Kooked Out! featuring a handful of local New Orleans musicians as well.\n\nIn the midst of these recording sessions yet another concept was taking shape. Outtakes turned into the first Garage a Trois release, Mysteryfunk (1999). In 2000 the trio, led by Moore behind the drum kit, was joined by percussionist Mike Dillon (Les Claypool, Ani DiFranco) and has since released three more albums \u2013 Emphasizer in 2003, Outre Mer in 2005 and Power Patriot in 2009.\n\nMoore extended his solo discography with the release of Flyin\u2019 the Koop (Verve/Blue Thumb) in 2001, and III (Telarc) in 2006. Following the latter Modern Drummer called Moore\u2019s trademark sound \u201cinfectious, jazz-meets-Bonham, nouveau second-line.\u201d Recorded at the legendary Preservation Hall in New Orleans, III featured organist Robert Walter (Greyboy Allstars, The Head Hunters) and guitarist Will Bernard (T.J. Kirk, Doctor Lonnie Smith) as the Stanton Moore Trio, with special guests Skerik and trombonist Mark Mullins (Galactic, Bonerama, Harry Connick, Jr., Better Than Ezra).\n\nIn 2008, Moore looked to continue his scaled back session crew with Walter and Bernard to record Emphasis! (on parenthesis). Says Moore, \u201cWhen it came time to do another record, I had already known for a while that I wanted to build on the momentum of this band \u2013 three musicians who were becoming a unit unto themselves \u2013 and I wanted to get a little more adventurous with the music itself.\u201d\n\nIn April 2010, Moore releases Groove Alchemy. The 12-track set is the culmination of Moore\u2019s multimedia project that also includes an instructional book and DVD of the same name. All three facets of the project are designed to explore the roots of funk drumming by examining the work of pioneers like Jabo Starks, Clyde Stubblefield, and Zigaboo Modeliste \u2013 each of whom made their mark at different times throughout the 1960s as the engines driving James Brown\u2019s and the Meters\u2019 legendary rhythm sections \u2013 and in turn tracing their influences back to the rhythms coming out of New Orleans in the earlier part of the 20th century. Recorded at Levon Helm\u2019s studio in Woodstock, NY, this project is the follow up to the widely acclaimed Take it to the Street DVD and book that focused specifically on New Orleans drumming styles.\n\nShowing his outstanding versatility, Moore has appeared on Heavy Metal Grammy nominees Corrosion of Conformity\u2019s In the Arms of God, Irma Thomas\u2019 After the Rain (winning a grammy in the process), Robert Walter\u2019s Super Heavy Organ, Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine) and Boots Riley\u2019s (the Coup) Street Sweeper Social Club, Will BernarDiane Birch\u2019s Bible Belt, Alec Ounsworth\u2019s (Clap Your Hands Say Yeah) Mo Beauty. He continues to play dates globally with an ever-evolving cast of musicians including John Scofield; Karl Denson; George Porter, Jr., and Leo Nocentelli (of the Meters); Charlie Hunter; Warren Haynes; John Medeski and Chris Wood (of Medeski, Martin and Wood); Donald Harrison Jr.; Dr. Lonnie Smith, Dr. John, Tab Benoit, Robert Walter; the New Orleans Klezmer All-Stars and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band to name a few.\n\nWith a bachelor\u2019s degree in music and business from Loyola University, Moore stays involved in education by constantly giving clinics and teaching master classes and private lessons all over the world. He has been a contributing writer for Drum!, Modern Drummer, and DownBeat magazines here he was featured on the covers of more than six drum publications. In 2005, he launched a signature line of cymbals with Bosphorus Cymbals and a signature drumstick with the Vic Firth stick company. In 2009, Moore developed his own drum company to introduce his signature titanium snare drum that he designed in conjunction with Ronn Dunnett.\n\nDeeply affected by Katrina and its aftermath, New Orleans\u2019 native son was quick to lend a hand by spearheaded the Tipitina\u2019s Music Workshop, free Sunday seminars that cater to children and a rotating cast of well-known professionals to promote the preservation of New Orleans music. He also set up the Staletta Fund, a scholarship started by he and his wife Aletta to help cover costs for aspiring students to attend jazz camps, auditions and further their education.\n\nMoore stays active as a spokesperson for the Gulf Restoration Network and is a regular proponent of and player with the Voice of the Wetlands All-Stars. Additionally he serves on the board of directors for the Roots of Music, a free music education and academic mentoring program founded by Derrick Tabb, drummer for Rebirth Brass Band and recent nominee for CNN\u2019s Heroes awards.\n\nGalactic\u2019s next record Ya-ka-may was released February 2010, and Moore steps into the role of producer on Anders Osborne\u2019s next record due out in April.", "otherInfo": "General Admission.

Gilles Peterson played the track at first on his famous now called Worldwide-show.\n\nGathering momentum with support from people like Wall of Sounds Mark Jones and tracks for fellow Austrians Count Basic or strange people like William Orbit, the further story of K&D and Richard's Tosca project is well documented on various compilations and twelve inch releases. They met people like the Ninja tune posse, touched base with the leftfield dance, befriended Munich's Compost crew, remixed artists as diverse as Bomb the bass, Bones thugs & harmony, Alex Reece, United Future Organisation, Rockers Hifi (the K&D version was used in the video of \"Going under\"), Lamb, Roni Size, Depeche Mode and dj-ed in more clubs than you would care to count.\n\nBe it their self-produced tracks or the sound of their remixes, the K&D symptomatic feeling of lush european loungcore-dub pervaded all swift changes of the triphop hype and survived as a highly personal expression that found easy access into the world of drum&bass when the breakbeats became soulful.\n\nTheir regular presence in the club circuit, a characteristic side effect of their consistant travelling as djs, made them well-received guest at the various crossing of an international beat-set that took them from Vienna to London, to the American Westcoast, to Germany and back, with a tightly packed dj-bag full of remixes tracing their steps.\n\nA mix-CD compilation, DJ-kicks, for german label studio K7 marked a relevant change in the overall concept of K&D or rather in the way the audience seemed to take them in.

Later, collaborating with Prince as a songwriter and Co-Producer on his projects. Now the lead guitarist and Musical Director of The Purple Ones, Seacer is determined to continue the musical legacy of his late friend and former band mate. He says one of the biggest keys to the authenticity is the \u2018controlled chaos\u201d that existed in Prince\u2019s world that allowed for extreme creativity, \u201cWith Prince,\u201d Levi says, \u201cyou tried everything. That\u2019s the biggest thing I learned from him over all those years.

Fang guitarist Tom Flynn and bass player Brian Beattie, his former bandmate from the bands \"Tapeworm\" and \"Safety Patrol\", put out \"Yukon Fang\" as a duo and thus Fang was born. The original version of Fang toured the country once, only to break up shortly thereafter with Beattie moving on to Texas where he later formed the band Glass Eye. In the early fall of 1981 Flynn began playing with drummer Chris Ritter. They soon added bass player Chris Wilson and began playing shows in the SF Bay area as a three piece, with Flynn on vocals.While this was happening, Sam McBride, the band's soon-to-be vocalist, was singing with future Fang drummer Greg Langston in the band \"Shut up\". In early 1982 Ritter was replaced with drummer Joel Fox, and at Fox's audition he brought along his friend McBride, who volunteered to be the band's singer. The lineup thus solidified as McBride (vocals), Chris Wilson (bass), Tom Flynn (guitar), and Joel Fox (drums). Together they contributed the song \"Fun with Acid\" on the Not so Quiet on the Western Front compilation LP. Shortly thereafter, guitarist Tom Flynn created \"Boner Records\" and released their debut LP and EP Landshark and Where the Wild Things Are. Tim Stiletto drummed on the latter. These two releases are now considered classic East Bay punk.\n\nIn January 1986, the \"Spun Helga\" LP was recorded in West Germany with McBride singing vocals, and two Germans named Joe (Guitar) and Ollie (Drums) playing instruments. We Bite Records in Germany released the LP, but in the U.S. it was handled by National Trust Records. Fang next released was 1987's \"A Mi Ga Sfafas?\" (The title literally means \"Give Me Head?\"). The lineup during this era was McBride, Bill Collins (guitar), Joe Miller (bass), and Steve Chinn (drums). Drummer Mike Branum replaced Chinn and Fang recorded the album \"Pissed-Off Buddah\", which remained unreleased until 2008, when it was released with Fang's other albums \"Spun Helga\" and \"A Mi Ga Sfafas?\"\n\nAfter a long break, Fang regrouped in 1996 and put out the \"Electric Chair\" single on Man's Ruin Records. The lineup at this time included Sam McBride (vocals), Greg Langston (Drums), Bill Burnett (Guitar) and Josh Levine (Bass). This incarnation of the Band recorded the \"American Nightmare\" LP on Wingnut Records.\n\nIn 1989, Boner Records released Fang's first compilation album, Landshark/Where the Wild Thing Are. The album included Fang's debut album and debut EP.\n\nIn 1999, Jim Martin (from Faith No More) joined on guitar, and recorded four songs for the Hello Records CD Fish and Vegetables, which was released as a split LP by fellow punk rock groups Dr. Know, and Hellions In May 2000, Sammytown and Jim Martin, along with Casey Orr (Gwar, Rigor Mortis) on bass, and Dallas drummer Clint Phillips did two shows in Texas. One at Trees in Dallas, and a sold out show at Emo's in Austin.\n\nBy 2001, the band was composed of Sammytown, Brian Schopflin (bass), Jonny Manak (guitar), Alby Wasted (guitar),and Ike Eichensehr (drums). Sammytown, Brian, Jonny, Alby and Ike also started The Resistoleros, a Oakland-based rock 'n' roll band. Steel Cage Records released the Resistoleros CD Rock 'N Roll Napalm in 2003.\n\nIn 2004, the Live Cheap\" CD' came out on Malt Soda Recordings featuring Sammytown (vocals), Brian Schopflin (bass), Ike Eichensehr (drums), Alby Wasted (guitar) and Jimmy Crucifix (guitarist for 1980s hardcore band Crucifix and hard rock band Proudflesh) also on guitar. This is the only Fang recording with two guitarists.\n\nIn 2004, the band toured the United States. Sammytown, Jimmy Crucifix (guitar), Brian Schopflin (bass)/Bubba Dennis (bass) and Ike Eichensehr (drums) toured as Fang in the Spring of 2004 and as the Resistoleros and Fang in November 2004 with Sam, Jimmy, Brian, Ike and Greg Elliott (rhythm guitar).\n\nIn January 2005, Sammy, Jimmy, Brian and Ike recorded a cover of Agression's (1980s hardcore\u2013Narcore band) song \"Salty Leather\" for a tribute to Agression members Mark Hickey and Henry Knowles, who had died. Dave Haro and JellyRoll came up with the idea for the tribute. The CD, Taking Out A Little Agression, was released on Dr. Strange Records in 2007 and featured bands including JFA, McRad, DI, Ill Repute, Dr. Know, Verbal Abuse, MDC, Oppressed Logic, Shattered Faith and Dave Haro\u2013JellyRoll's band KatKiller.\n\nFrom 2005\u20132008, Fang performed with the steady line-up of Sammytown, Jimmy Crucifix, Brian Schopflin, and Greg Langsten (returning to the drums). As of writing (July, 2012) the line-up consists of Sammytown (Vocals), Jamey Dangerous (Drums), Brian Schopflin (Bass), J-Stain Werthless (Lead Guitar), Mat ('The Kid') McCoy (Guitar). Original member Tom Flynn has re-emerged and played live with the band on at least one occasion in 2012. He also contributed to the latest Fang album, 'Here Come the Cops\".\n\nIn 2011, Malt Soda released the CD \"Pissed Off Buddha\", comprising three Fang albums - \"Spun Helga\", \"A Mi Ga Sfafas?\", and \"Pissed Off Buddha\" - the latter being a previously unreleased album recorded in 1988, in a double disc package that included a live DVD of the band.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "859 O'farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Watkins Family Hour ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7484262.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "Americana, Folk", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "For singer-songwriter-multi-instrumentalists Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins, the Watkins Family Hour has long been an oasis from the rigors of the road, a laboratory where they can try out new material or master beloved cover songs. Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

There, Schneider began to develop her personal way of writing for what would become her 18-member collective, made up of many of the finest musicians in jazz today, tailoring her compositions to distinctly highlight the uniquely creative voices of the group. The Maria Schneider Orchestra has performed at festivals and concert halls worldwide. She herself has received numerous commissions and guest-conducting invites, working with over 90 groups in over 30 countries.\n\nSchneider\u2019s music blurs the lines between genres, making her long list of commissioners quite varied, stretching from Jazz at Lincoln Center, to The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, to collaborating with David Bowie. She is among a small few to have received GRAMMYS in multiple genres, have received the award in both jazz and classical categories, as well as for her work with David Bowie.\n\nSchneider and her orchestra have a distinguished recording career with twelve GRAMMY nominations and five GRAMMY awards. Unique funding of projects has become a hallmark for Schneider through the trend-setting company, ArtistShare. Her album, Concert in the Garden (2004) became historic as the first recording to win a GRAMMY with Internet-only sales, even more significantly, it blazed the \"crowd-funding\" trail as ArtistShare\u2019s first release. She\u2019s been awarded many honors by the Jazz Journalists Association and DOWNBEAT and JAZZTIMES Critics and Readers Polls. In 2012, her alma mater, the University of Minnesota, presented Schneider with an honorary doctorate. ASCAP awarded her their esteemed Concert Music Award in 2014. And in 2019, the National Endowment for the Arts bestowed on Schneider the nation's highest honor in jazz, naming her an NEA Jazz Master.\n\nSchneider has become a strong voice for music advocacy and in 2014, testified before the US Congressional Subcommittee on Intellectual Property about digital rights. She has also appeared in CNN, participated in round-tables for the United States Copyright Office, and has been quoted in numerous publications for her views on Spotify, Pandora, YouTube, Google, digital rights, and music piracy.\n\nA collaboration with her orchestra and David Bowie resulted in his single called, \"Sue (Or In A Season of Crime),\u201d and brought Schneider a 2016 GRAMMY (Best Arrangement, Instruments and Vocals). Schneider and her orchestra also received a 2016 GRAMMY for The Thompson Fields (Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album).

Pool had carved out a unique place for himself in the bass music community; performing under the moniker of SPL for over 10 years and releasing drum & bass, dubstep, and trap-oriented music on respected labels such as Barcode, Tech Itch, Evol Intent, Sub Human, Rottunn, and SMOG Recordings. SPL\u2019s music was fully immersed in sound design, a musical landscape comprised of melodic, dark, and refined touches. By the Summer of 2014, Pool came to the realization that he had pushed the SPL project to its sonic boundaries and in order to evolve musically, he would need a new project to explore lighter textures and richer melodies. Rooted in jungle and bass music and built around elements of blippy 8-bit sounds, arpeggios, and lush 80s synths, Champagne Drip launched as a decidedly tropical and uplifting sounding project. Operating at first in anonymity, Champagne Drip made a big splash thru the release of official remixes of Bassnectar (Amorphous Music) and Elliphant (Mad Decent). Shortly thereafter, he released his debut EP \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d on Mad Decent in September of 2014. Over the first year of the project\u2019s history, press outlets were fascinated with the unique sound, but also with uncovering the identity of the secretive producer behind the music. \u201cRadio Bikini\u201d was subsequently remixed by electronic upstarts Big Wild, Lazerdisk, Mayhem, and Son of Kick and released in the Spring of 2015 as \u201cRemix Bikini\u201d. In the Fall of 2015, Champagne Drip released his 2nd EP for Mad Decent, \u201cJourney Into The Champagne Sea\u201d. Whereas his first EP explored more overtly tropical overtones, \u201cJourney\u201d went into deeper and darker musical territory. After spending one full year refining his sound in the studio, he finally revealed himself as the former SPL in 2016; performing across the US at such festivals as Mysteryland, WTFest?, Imagine, Enchanted Forest, and Lights All Night. Building up anticipation for his next original recordings, Champagne Drip released the stand alone single \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d, which was featured on the official Bernie Sanders Presidential campaign fundraising compilation \u201cRave4Bernie\u201d. Official remixes for Grandtheft (Mad Decent), Cardinox (Warner Brothers), and Dillon Francis & NGHTMRE (Mad Decent) followed. Champagne Drip capped off an already busy 2016 with the release of two new EPs; \u201cPoseidon\u201d via Quality Goods Records and \u201cOf Course I Still Love You\u201d via Saturate Records. Official remixes for Zeds Dead & Diplo, UZ, and DAWN all saw early 2017 releases. Champagne Drip is set to have his biggest year yet in 2017, with multiple EPs scheduled for release on Deadbeats Records as well as forthcoming remixes for 12th Planet and Mayhem, which are due for Summer releases. https://twitter.com/champagnedrip https://soundcloud.com/champagnedrip https://www.instagram.com/champagnedrip Bookings: champagnedripbookings@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1 Old Rancheria Rd, Nicasio, CA 94946", "Artist": "Fleetwood Macrame ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9069856.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.69817, 38.06214], "Date": "Sat Apr 18 2020", "EventDate": "2020-04-18", "Genre": "Country, Classic Rock, Rock", "Time": "3:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Rancho Nicasio", "moreBioInfo": "Fleetwood Macram\u00e9 is quickly becoming the Bay Area's most exciting tribute band.

I started to embrace that, and I think people connect to the sound.\u201d For the uninitiated, they\u2019ll definitely connect to the group\u2019s 2017 single \u201cHate Mail\u201d featuring J Mascis. On the track, a buzz of feedback slips into melodic guitar and an unshakable rhythm as the frontwoman captivates with the confessionally catchy refrain, \u201cI hate everything you\u2019re saying, get away from me. I hate everything we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s a waste of me.\u201d It\u2019s the perfect backdrop for an epic Mascis cameo. \u201cIt\u2019s about when I was miserable in this other band,\u201d recalls Sturino. \u201cThis is the most important thing to me. I don\u2019t live comfortably. I don\u2019t have a lot of money. I don\u2019t have a lot of free time, because I\u2019m putting all of my effort, passion, and self into music. So, it has to be the right situation. At the time, I just wasn\u2019t working with the right team. The song is about those corrosive relationships with emotionally abusive assholes. J is a guitar god for indie rock. He\u2019s an obvious inspiration, and he killed it.\u201d \u201cHate Mail\u201d hints at a lot more to come from Weakened Friends. For Sturino, the band brings everything full circle. In tow with her best friend Cam and wife Annie, she encodes a powerful message in the lyrics. \u201cA lot of times, you hear expressions like, \u2018Find your happy\u2019,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cI think you should find yourself. Our music is about self-awareness and finding that. Sometimes, you\u2019re having a shitty day. It can be hard, and that\u2019s beautiful in its own way. In the North American mentality, if you\u2019re depressed or sad, you have to just get rid of it. This is less about getting rid of that feeling and finding those things causing the feeling and dealing with them. It\u2019s self-awareness, believing in yourself, finding yourself, and defining how you feel. That\u2019s what this band is to me.\u201d We're three tall young adults making some songs and eating some snacks.

The Purple Ones tap into that soulful artistry like none other.\n\nThe Purple Ones is a labor of love that was born in 2012 when Bay Area based bandleader and founder, Morty Okin (\u201cThe New Morty Show\u201d, co-founder of the Michael Jackson tribute \u201cForeverland\u201d and Neil Diamond tribute \u201cSuper Diamond\u201d,) decided to focus all of his energy on building the greatest Prince homage on the planet.\n\nThe Purple Ones have been packing concert venues since their inception, growing a fan base over the years that includes long time Prince devotees and newbies that are just discovering the icon.

Couple that with all their music friends joining in on the fun, and this new CD makes a very strong case for Northern California being the new torch-bearing center of the classic Chicago and Texas blues sound.\nSix stellar originals tell the couple\u2019s individual and combined personal histories in an honest and cosmic way. Beth & RW\u2019s love of the classic blues vibe pays off and yet, these songs could easily be covered by well-known singers in many roots music idioms.\nNestled alongside are songs by their mid-20th century heroes Jimmy Reed (lead track, \u201cThere\u2019ll Be a Day\u201d, \u201cAin\u2019t That Loving You Baby\u201d), Memphis Minnie (\u201cLookin\u2019 the World Over\u201d), Big Bill Broonzy (\u201cLonesome Road Blues\u201d), jump blues brother-sister act, Buddy & Ella Johnson (\u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Stop It\u201d) and Memphis Slim (\u201cMother Earth.\u201d)\nRed\u2019s Blues has a finger-poppin\u2019 attitude\u2014straight outta the afore-mentioned golden years when blues, R&B and swing all meshed together and dance floors every night were filled with snake hips and slow drags. Beth, with her sensual, southern voice and classy behind-the-beat phrasing is more a Julie London or Bobbie Gentry-styled singer: smoky with languid, sexy sophistication. She can swing too, just check out the big fun on \u201cWhy Don\u2019t Ya Stop It.\u201d This rich nightclub feel is missed on too many modern singers. The yearning confidentiality, the wise heart that Beth brings to her true-life stories reveal tales of youth seen through grown up reflection.\nRW, who has not lost his hometown Rome, Georgia accent has this quality also. Upright bass never had a better companion\u2014it\u2019s no wonder that RW has anchored the doghouse rhythm for Mark Hummel\u2019s legendary Harmonica Blowouts for ten years. Together, Beth & RW have a rare and beautiful combination of poetry, humor and groove in their music. What other couple in more recent music memory had this? Could they be the blues Sonny & Cher? Johnny & June? Whether up-tempo or ballad, this makes for a great live show \u2014part juke joint, part nightclub. They are uptown and lowdown.\nTheir friends on this release are California harp masters Rick Estrin and Mark Hummel, Texas guitar masters Anson Funderburgh and Mike Keller, Texas drummer and RW Grigsby\u2019s childhood music sidekick, Wes Starr (the dazzling team from Hummel\u2019s Golden State-Lone Star Revue) guitarist and harmonica player Dave Earl and two Sacramento Hall of Famers, guitarists Robert Sidwell and Steve Randall.\nVeteran Bay Area Musician Dave Earl, now living in the Sierra foothills, played guitar and rack harmonica in Red\u2019s Blues for two years. \u201cDoug Crumpacker of Hucklebucks reknown, is currently Red\u2019s Blues\u2019 guitar player. When we have another guitar player on stage with us, he knows when to drop back and support the other artist. He\u2019s a fine addition to our band and is up there with the best. Also a great part of our rhythm section is Tim Wilbur, Sacramento\u2019s own shuffle king.\u201d Doug, Tim and RW are all members of the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame.\nDrummer/studio owner/engineer Larry Carr understands the great 1950s Chicago drummers like Jimmy Reed\u2019s great shuffle drummer Earl Phillips. He also has a terrific beatnik bongo/shakers turn on one of the album highlights, \u201cI\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)\u201d penned by RW. If Robert Mitchum were still around, THIS 2-minute warning would absolutely be his theme song.\nYoung Hammond B-3 lions are here too. James Pace (Tommy Castro) and Kid Andersen (award-winning blues producer; and formerly with Terry Hanck, Charlie Musselwhite, now Rick Estrin & The Nightcats), and John Cocuzzi all take turns and elegant swingman Cocuzzi adds his deep blues piano touch on three songs.\nIt is always good to know what the artists themselves want to say about each song choice they carefully made and the originals they wrote:\n1. There\u2019ll Be A Day- the flip side of Jimmy Reed\u2019s 1963 hit \u201cShame, Shame, Shame.\u201d Original 3rd verse written by Beth contains the album title You Knock Me Out.\n2. Poor Girl- inspired by RW and Beth\u2019s time managing a ghetto bingo hall in Montgomery, Alabama and a girl with a gambling problem.\n3. Lookin\u2019 The World Over- Memphis Minnie\u2019s tale of travels with her righteous man. Killer Estrin harp solo.\n4. That\u2019s All- written after Beth found a picture of her mother\u2019s. A family tale of living, loving and dying.\n5. Ain\u2019t That Loving You Baby- Jimmy Reed cover features Mark Hummel on harp and the Golden State Lone Star Revue.\n6. Baby Walk On- RW original inspired by Mose Allison. Solos by Hummel, Mike Keller and Anson Funderburgh.\n7. Stonebroke- originally recorded in 1992 with RW on Gary Primich\u2019s My Pleasure on Austin\u2019s Amazing Records. Rick Estrin plays some fine solos. A Primich original.\n8. Why Don\u2019t You Stop It- Buddy and Ella Johnson tune, Lou Ann Barton used to sing this with Roomful of Blues.\n9. Pat\u2019s Blues-Original tune about our friend who went on a binge and woke up with a stranger who\u2019s name she didn\u2019t know....yep it\u2019s true. Only we changed it to a tune about our friend, a guy, because it didn\u2019t sound right, Beth singing about a girl.....)\n10. Lonesome Road Blues- Big Bill Broonzy road tune.\n11. I\u2019m Trouble (Hillbilly Bongo Blues)- RW original, Larry Carr on bongos, hillbilly beatnik.\n12. Somewhere Down The Line- Another RW&B original, trying to channel the feel of south Louisiana in this song of reconciliation. Nice soloing from John Cocuzzi and Steve Randall. Another family tale.\n13. Mother Earth- Memphis Slim cover brings it all home. Solos by John Cocuzzi and Robert Sidwell. On a Blues Cruise in 2012, Barrelhouse Chuck asked Beth if she knew \u201cMother Earth.\u201d She said \u201cno, but I know Blues is Everywhere.\u201d He said, \u201cI love your voice. Learn that song.\u201d So she did\u2014\"never got to sing it with him, though. I was glad RW thought of putting it on the CD.\u201d\n\nA little more Beth & RW back story:\nBeth, thanks to her older brother, grew up listening to Huddie Ledbetter, Muddy Waters and Mississippi John Hurt records and as a kid, learned from and sang songs at home with her Mom-- \u201c Summertime,\u201d \u201cGod Bless the Child,\u201d and St. Louis Blues.\u201d Across the street in her hometown of south Santa Barbara though, the shy 7 year old redhead was bold enough to go perch on the neighbor\u2019s porch listening to a Cuban salsa band rehearse, and from that learned to love the rhythms, the bass and percussion in particular. She and RW met through the local Santa Barbara blues scene years later in 1977, and have lived in his home state of Georgia and then Texas before heading back to sunny Sacramento, California in 2006.\n2014 Grammy-nominated and Blues Music Award (BMA) winner bassist RW Grigsby has been playing since he was 14 years old, and began his professional career when still a teenager. He's toured the U.S., Canada and Europe since the '80s, and currently juggles playing with Red's Blues, Mark Hummel and the Blues Survivors and The Golden State/Lone Star Blues Revue. He played and recorded with Texas blues stars Gary Primich and Black Top Records\u2019 Mike Morgan and the Crawl in the 1990s. RW is the bassist on the 2014 Grammy-nominated and BMA-winning CD, Remembering Little Walter. He was nominated for a BMA \u201cBest Bassist\u201d Award in 2017, and was inducted into the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame in 2018.\nRed\u2019s Blues draw their audiences into a grown-up music world\u2014southern music with downhome simmer, dance floor fun and stellar, sophisticated players who know they have no need to blast at earsplitting volumes to make the biggest impact.\n\u2013 Bio by Mindy Giles, \u00a9 2018\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/redsbluessac\n(916) 342-4281 bethgrigsby@comcast.net", "otherInfo": "Red\u2019s Blues is bringing our unique blues and original Americana music back to The Back Room.

Driven and inspired by the thriving music scene of his hometown which includes such greats as Professor Longhair, Doctor John and The Meters, Moore\u2019s name is now mentioned amongst these Big Easy mainstays.\n\nIn the early \u201890s, Moore helped found the New Orleans-based essential funk band Galactic. Their first album, 1996\u2019s widely acclaimed Coolin\u2019 Off, led to an intense tour schedule of nearly 200 gigs a year for the next ten years. Building on their fan base by adding an esteemed list of all-star collaborations to the six albums that followed, Galactic continues to amass a worldwide audience via recording and touring globally.\n\nMoore launched his solo career in 1998 aided by eight-string guitar virtuoso Charlie Hunter and saxophonist Skerik (Les Claypool, John Scofield, Roger Waters). The group recorded All Kooked Out! featuring a handful of local New Orleans musicians as well.\n\nIn the midst of these recording sessions yet another concept was taking shape. Outtakes turned into the first Garage a Trois release, Mysteryfunk (1999). In 2000 the trio, led by Moore behind the drum kit, was joined by percussionist Mike Dillon (Les Claypool, Ani DiFranco) and has since released three more albums \u2013 Emphasizer in 2003, Outre Mer in 2005 and Power Patriot in 2009.\n\nMoore extended his solo discography with the release of Flyin\u2019 the Koop (Verve/Blue Thumb) in 2001, and III (Telarc) in 2006. Following the latter Modern Drummer called Moore\u2019s trademark sound \u201cinfectious, jazz-meets-Bonham, nouveau second-line.\u201d Recorded at the legendary Preservation Hall in New Orleans, III featured organist Robert Walter (Greyboy Allstars, The Head Hunters) and guitarist Will Bernard (T.J. Kirk, Doctor Lonnie Smith) as the Stanton Moore Trio, with special guests Skerik and trombonist Mark Mullins (Galactic, Bonerama, Harry Connick, Jr., Better Than Ezra).\n\nIn 2008, Moore looked to continue his scaled back session crew with Walter and Bernard to record Emphasis! (on parenthesis). Says Moore, \u201cWhen it came time to do another record, I had already known for a while that I wanted to build on the momentum of this band \u2013 three musicians who were becoming a unit unto themselves \u2013 and I wanted to get a little more adventurous with the music itself.\u201d\n\nIn April 2010, Moore releases Groove Alchemy. The 12-track set is the culmination of Moore\u2019s multimedia project that also includes an instructional book and DVD of the same name. All three facets of the project are designed to explore the roots of funk drumming by examining the work of pioneers like Jabo Starks, Clyde Stubblefield, and Zigaboo Modeliste \u2013 each of whom made their mark at different times throughout the 1960s as the engines driving James Brown\u2019s and the Meters\u2019 legendary rhythm sections \u2013 and in turn tracing their influences back to the rhythms coming out of New Orleans in the earlier part of the 20th century. Recorded at Levon Helm\u2019s studio in Woodstock, NY, this project is the follow up to the widely acclaimed Take it to the Street DVD and book that focused specifically on New Orleans drumming styles.\n\nShowing his outstanding versatility, Moore has appeared on Heavy Metal Grammy nominees Corrosion of Conformity\u2019s In the Arms of God, Irma Thomas\u2019 After the Rain (winning a grammy in the process), Robert Walter\u2019s Super Heavy Organ, Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine) and Boots Riley\u2019s (the Coup) Street Sweeper Social Club, Will BernarDiane Birch\u2019s Bible Belt, Alec Ounsworth\u2019s (Clap Your Hands Say Yeah) Mo Beauty. He continues to play dates globally with an ever-evolving cast of musicians including John Scofield; Karl Denson; George Porter, Jr., and Leo Nocentelli (of the Meters); Charlie Hunter; Warren Haynes; John Medeski and Chris Wood (of Medeski, Martin and Wood); Donald Harrison Jr.; Dr. Lonnie Smith, Dr. John, Tab Benoit, Robert Walter; the New Orleans Klezmer All-Stars and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band to name a few.\n\nWith a bachelor\u2019s degree in music and business from Loyola University, Moore stays involved in education by constantly giving clinics and teaching master classes and private lessons all over the world. He has been a contributing writer for Drum!, Modern Drummer, and DownBeat magazines here he was featured on the covers of more than six drum publications. In 2005, he launched a signature line of cymbals with Bosphorus Cymbals and a signature drumstick with the Vic Firth stick company. In 2009, Moore developed his own drum company to introduce his signature titanium snare drum that he designed in conjunction with Ronn Dunnett.\n\nDeeply affected by Katrina and its aftermath, New Orleans\u2019 native son was quick to lend a hand by spearheaded the Tipitina\u2019s Music Workshop, free Sunday seminars that cater to children and a rotating cast of well-known professionals to promote the preservation of New Orleans music. He also set up the Staletta Fund, a scholarship started by he and his wife Aletta to help cover costs for aspiring students to attend jazz camps, auditions and further their education.\n\nMoore stays active as a spokesperson for the Gulf Restoration Network and is a regular proponent of and player with the Voice of the Wetlands All-Stars.

Her literary songwriting is filled with stories about changing relationships, life on the road, and\u2014implausibly enough\u2014a song that finds beauty and longing in jet lag. In addition to her solo work and touring with Della Mae, Courtney has worked with a range of musicians including Tom Petty and the Heartbreaker\u2019s Mike Campbell, Buffy St. Marie and Hot Rize\u2019s Bryan Sutton.

On their new album, \"With All Its Thorns,\" they delve deeper into country music's tradition of storytelling with songs about betrayal (\"Secrets\"), murder (\"In Red\"), and grief (\"Ghostship\"), with a whole lot of heartbreak in between. Their twangy honesty shines through in straightforward arrangements, crystalline harmonies, and spare instrumentation. Beware their catchy hooks and sweet melodies - these stray puppy tunes will follow you home and become your most steadfast companions.\n\nLaura Benitez, songwriter, lead singer and founder of Laura Benitez and the Heartache, has been making her mark on stage and screen since 2000. She spent several years appearing in soap operas and commercials in Los Angeles before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2004, diving into the region\u2019s rich Americana and Roots music scenes. Taking her musical cues from the heavily rock influenced Bakersfield sound, and her lyric inspiration from her favorite songwriters Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn, Laura began writing songs in 2008. She released her first album, \"For Duty or for Love\" on her own Copperhead Records label in 2010.\n\nIn 2012 she recruited the multi-talented singer, songwriter, and drummer Michele Kappel-Stone (Kirby Grips/Tippy Canoe/Heartache Sisters) into the band, and was lucky enough to secure the talents of Bob Spector (The Spectones) and Ted O'Connell (The GoldDiggers, Moonshine Maybelline) on twang guitar and bass. These four joined together with Ian Taylor Sutton (The Walcotts, Misisipi Mike, Secret Town) on pedal steel to record their critically acclaimed full length album, \"Heartless Woman,\" which was released in 2014.\n\n2015 saw the band touring to festivals in Southern California and Nashville, but also saw some changes in personnel, with Michele Kappel-Stone and Ted O'Connell turning their full-time attention to other projects.
