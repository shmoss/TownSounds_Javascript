But I can\u2019t really listen to it anymore. It kind of broke my brain. It took a year, and there were a lot of times I thought it was going nowhere, a lot of botched sessions. It was all my fault, no one else\u2019s. I was just totally unprepared. I went in with over-confidence, I went in there like \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m ready to go!\u2019 but I was just kind of bullshitting. I went in expecting to make a fucking masterpiece, but I kept hitting a brick wall.\nI was under a lot of stress because I was trying to make an anti-folk record and I was having trouble doing it. I wanted to make something deep-fried and more me-sounding. I didn\u2019t want to be jammy acoustic guy anymore. I just wanted to make something weird and far-out that came from the heart finally. I was always trying to make something like this I guess, trying to catch up with my imagination. And I think I succeeded in that way \u2014 it\u2019s got some weird instrumentation on there, and some surreal far-out words.\nAnd it\u2019s more Chicago-y sounding. Chicago sounds like a train constantly coming towards you but never arriving. That\u2019s the sound I hear, all the time, ringing in my ears. Everybody here\u2019s always hustling. Everybody who talks to you on the street\u2019s always got something they\u2019re coming at you with. It\u2019s the sound of strangers dodging one another. And landlords knocking on doors to get rent that people don\u2019t have. But it\u2019s eerily quiet at night. This record is the sound of walking home late at night through Chicago in the middle of winter and being half-creeped out, scared someone\u2019s going to punch you in the back of the head, and half in the most tranquil state you\u2019ve been in all day, enjoying the quiet and this faint wind, and buses going by on all-night routes. That\u2019s the sound to tune in to. That\u2019s the sound of Chicago to me.\nChicago. More than ever I\u2019m just finding little details about it that I love. There\u2019s so many weird twists about it: the way that street lights look here is really peculiar, and a really bleak sense when you walk around. It looks gray, there\u2019s not a lot of color, and I find a lot of radiance in that. And oh man it smells like diesel. And garbage cans. And in the summer when it really heats up it\u2019s extra garbage-canny. And everything here looks like it\u2019s about to break. It looks like it\u2019s derelict. But that\u2019s what I\u2019m used to, that\u2019s what I like. The amount of imperfection in this city is really perfect.\nSo I\u2019ve fallen in love with Chicago pretty hard over the past year, despite crippling depression. I\u2019ve realized I can\u2019t not be in a city. I appreciate nature, I appreciate driving through nature, but you put me in a campsite for more than two days and I\u2019ll flip the fuck out. I need to hear people outside of my window trying to buy crack. I need to be able to buy a taco at two in the morning. I need to hear the neighbors yelling really fucking loud at each other in the middle of the night. I need people. I need people really fucking bad.\nYou have to find calm in the city. You actively search for it. It\u2019s not a la carte like it is in the middle of the Rocky Mountains. Which are beautiful, they\u2019re one of God\u2019s finest creations \u2014 I\u2019m not talking shit about the Rocky Mountains. But in the city it\u2019s like scoring drugs, you\u2019ve got to score your tranquil situations. And that\u2019s the sound of Chicago to me.\nThe songs don\u2019t really deal with any political or personal or social issues at all. Mostly it just comes from being bummed out. And there\u2019s not a lot of musical influences on the record. I wasn\u2019t even listening to music when I made it. Last year was probably the least I\u2019ve listened to music in my adult life. I mean I was listening to stuff in the van \u2014 I listened to a lot of Genesis records. I got really into Genesis. But there\u2019s nothing else I could point to. Maybe I\u2019d say it\u2019s a record for coming up or coming down. It\u2019s not an album for the middle of the day. It\u2019s for the beginning or end of it.\nI quit drugs and booze recently. I got sick of being a party animal \u2014 I don\u2019t want to be 19-gin-and-tonics-Ryley anymore. My brain is working a little better now, but man I was just going at it pretty wildly, and then trying to make a record while I was drinking, it was kind of like torture.\nWe all had no idea what was going on, every song we\u2019d be like \u2018What is this record?\u2019 Because every song sounded different. In a way this record was working with everybody that I\u2019ve worked with for years, and it wasn\u2019t like a Fleetwood Mac thing where everybody fell in love and divorced or anything, but a lot of times we were butting heads in the studio.\nI hadn\u2019t played any of the songs live ever, whereas with my earlier records I\u2019d play the shit out of them live and then go into the studio when they were totally cooked up and ready to go. But these songs were all half ideas and riffs I had on my mind, so that held things up for a while.\nBeing meticulous and being deets-oriented is not my thing at all. I\u2019ve never been like that. I\u2019m kind of like go go go! Making a quick record is not hard, it\u2019s the easiest thing the world, so working in this time frame, over a year, made me go kind of nuts and\u2026 oh, tortured artist bullshit, blah blah blah. But then last summer we started playing songs back to back and finally we started to hear a common thread running through the record.\nI\u2019m lucky enough to have some people who are playing on it who had a big part in shaping the songs and writing with me. Cooper Crain, the guy who engineered it, and played all the synthesizers. And when the flute guy, Nate Lepine came in, that was really something that made it special. The producer was this guy LeRoy Bach. I love LeRoy, he\u2019s a really talented guy. He did the last record too.\nThe last record was cool but I was still figuring out what I was good at. But I\u2019m fucking 28 years old, I\u2019ve got to figure out a sound, figure out something that I enjoy doing. So this record is a little bit more grown up. Ol\u2019Ryley\u2019s just workin\u2019 on bein\u2019 a better Ryley.\nI think more than anything the thing to take away from this record is that I appreciate what improv and jamming and that outlook on music has done for me, but I wanted rigid structure for these songs. I don\u2019t want to expand upon them live. There\u2019s a looseness to some of the songs I guess, but I didn\u2019t want to rely on just hanging out on one note. It\u2019s so straight-forward that I can see a lot of people really not liking it to be honest. But I\u2019m so happy, I\u2019m happy that it\u2019s completely different and unexpected.\nBut I know it\u2019s divisive. It\u2019s hard to talk about. It\u2019s a weird record.\nRyley Walker was in conversation with Laura Barton.\nWild Pink\nWild Pink songwriter John Ross sings about lakes, hills and trees; moss, thickets and canopies; smoke, snow and wind. The impressionistic cover art of the band\u2019s eponymous debut full-length (2017) depicts a serene riverbed flush with dreamy hues of purple and green. It evokes a sense of tranquility that diametrically opposes their clamorous homebase of NYC, and the record\u2019s mostly breezy\u2014though occasionally blustery\u2014songset is equally uncharacteristic of the environment it was born of. It\u2019s not that their music perpetually idles, or that\u2019s it\u2019s soft in a simplistic way. They just move at their own pace. A patient pace. A very deliberate pace that\u2019s, however unintentional, at odds with both their city and their position in rock\u2019s timeline.\nOn their brand new follow-up Yolk In The Fur, Wild Pink again take themselves and their listeners to a place of sonic placidity. Ross and his bandmates trade what sparing crunch they did use on Wild Pink for lush, balmy synths that lift their sound upwards and out, rather than forward and down. Any traces of slowcore and grunge are gone here, replaced by the angelic airiness of Cocteau Twins and Red House Painters, but with the modern crispness of LAKE or Japanese Breakfast. Sporadic splashes of electronic drums and emphasized basslines add fascinating new dimensions to their already-diverse palette, but no instrument or tone ever feels shoehorned in. Each part is stitched seamlessly into the other, and the band\u2019s aptitude for unexpected changeups is only heightened with the ability to shift from artificial to natural instrumentation.\nAlthough it\u2019s both the shortest and most straightforward cut in the tracklist, closer \u201cAll Some Frenchman\u2019s Joke\u201d is a satisfying thematic knot for what Ross says is an album about \u201cprotecting something vulnerable.\u201d \u201cLetting go of youth after the time is due/feels like relief/like when something stuck is freed,\u201d he sings. To call this album a maturation for Wild Pink is to not only recycle a long-frayed cliche, but to neglect the musical and lyrical wiseness they already possessed on their debut. But if Ross really did quell an existential crisis during the making of Yolk In The Fur, and managed to finally scrub the gunk clean, the fresh coat that grew back took form as one of the purest, fleeciest, most lavish rock albums of 2018.

Even Sundays get a special treatment with discount J\u00e4gerbombs (a shot of J\u00e4germeister dropped in a pint of Red Bull). There is a $10-$15 cover every day of the week, but early bird specials and passes on the website can get you in for free or at reduced prices - just be sure to tip the dancers and the bartenders.", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "The Condor Club"}, {"Address": "34 S B St, San Mateo, CA 94401", "Artist": "Michelle Lambert", "ArtistBio": "\u201cMichelle Lambert is the kind of electric performer whose deep talent reveals itself in sly, knowing bursts.

The album is a personal journey. one that has its roots with the death of his childhood friend in 2012. It was an event that would inspire the title track of the new EP. 'Inside' is notable for it's sound. Gone are Alex' acoustic guitar undertones replaced with layers of electric guitar, breathing new life into old tunes like 'Elana' and 'Voices, and transforming others. Riff Magazine describes 'Thingamahoo', the first single, as a song that \"tells a story of distant past and joyful memories, [which] really stands out when the guitars come out heavy and full. Jimenez' style of 90's power pop has never sounded better.\"\n\nAlex will be joined by his full band. Lindy LaFontaine, whose help with arrangement is always invaluable, will join on keyboards and harmonies, Reese Douglas on guitar, and Andr\u00e9 Custodio on drums.\n\nOakland Riviera is the former Freeway Recording Studio, and has a rich Oakland music history. Artists who rehearsed and recorded there include Tower of Power, Sly Stone, the Escovedos, B. B. King, Irma Thomas, Eddie Money, and Tony! Toni! Tone!. It is now the musical home of jazz bassist Dan Keller and Survivor Sound.\n\nOakland Riviera is a smallish venue, with a comfortable capacity of 50. We are asking for a $10-20 donation. 100% tickets sales are going directly to the artists. Info & RSVP at acoustic.noize@gmail.com.\n\nThere is no bar, so this is a BYOB event. There will be water and some other things, but please bring drink and food to share.\n\nAlex is VERY stoked and honored to be sharing this evening with 3 rocking local artists, Matt Jaffe, Terese Taylor, and Thunderegg! August is also Alex' birthday month, so we are set for a fantastic evening of rock! Hope you can join us.\n\n----\n\nMatt Jaffe http://www.mattjaffemusic.com\nMatt Jaffe is a singer/songwriter from San Francisco. Cutting his teeth on open mics around the Bay Area, Matt started taking music (a little bit) more seriously when Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads offered to produce his first record. Since then, Matt has churned out more songs than he can remember the words to, oversaturated the market with gigs (opening for the likes of Mavis Staples and Jackie Greene), and collaborated with the likes of Chuck Prophet and Tom Higgenson of the Plain White T's. Having toured the country playing places like The Fillmore and your local hipster's basement, Matt is back in the studio with his band, readying his fourth record and preparing to bring the guitar gospel back to the masses.\n\nTerese Taylor https://www.teresetaylor.com\nTerese Taylor\u2019s music describes a personal world - or maybe series of worlds - that is dark, stark and cynical. Or perhaps, she is simply laying reality out in front of us as she sees it and letting us interpret her images through our own lens. Or maybe both at once. That is the genius of Terese Taylor, a songwriter and musical artist who uses her lyrics to paint sharp, steel cut images of life that upon closer inspection can be ambiguous. The same goes for her music. Is it rock, folk, country, or punk\u2026 or something that is simply Terese Taylor, best enjoyed without analysis?\n\nThunderegg https://thunderegg.org\nHalf San Francisco, half Oakland, all rock, Thunderegg has recorded nearly 20 albums since 1994. Influenced by bands including Velvet Underground, Neil Young, Teenage Fanclub, and the Boo Radleys, the Egg takes simple, melodic tunes with sharp lyrics and swirls them up with layers of guitars. Thunderegg is the band and longtime recording project of Will Georgantas, based for many years in Brooklyn, now operating out of San Francisco/ Oakland. There have been 20 Thunderegg albums since 1994, some recorded with a full band, some recorded solo to four-track cassette, but the latest, May 2018\u2019s 'Cosmos', is the first one to be released on vinyl. Produced by Alan Weatherhead (Sparklehorse, Magnolia Electric Co.) 'Cosmos' is the Egg's deepest plunge yet into space, blending the usual clever lyrics, sweet melodies, and ragged rocking with a layered roar that begs to be blasted.\n\nAlex Jimenez http://alexjimenezmusic.com\nA product of the early San Francisco indie music scene, Alex Jimenez has spent the majority of his life creating music to share with his fellow musicians and community. An avid guitar player and singer, Alex is currently focusing on his solo work, a blend of 90's pop meets gritty blues. He made the transition from bass player in the 90's to songwriter in 2001, when he wrote his first 5 songs back to back. He subsequently formed the acoustic duo Ms.Quito with artist/performer Allison Hennessey. In 2012, he released his first album \u2018The Acoustik Projekt\u2019, with songwriter/conga player Mark Edgar. That same year, his 2 year, fifteen show odyssey, The Usual Suspects Songwriter Showcase, became a critical favorite, showcasing some of the Bay Area\u2019s finest talent. His new EP, \u2018Inside\u2019, was produced and engineered by Ryan Clark, and he is writing songs for his next full length album. Alex can also be seen moonlighting as Thunderegg's full time rocking bass player.", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Oakland Riviera"}, {"Address": "5475 Old Redwood Hwy, Penngrove, CA 94951", "Artist": "Miracle Mule", "ArtistBio": "No artist bio available", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.68, 38.28], "Date": "Sat Aug 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-08-31", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "Miracle Mule", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Twin Oaks Roadhouse"}, {"Address": "224 Vintage Wy, Novato, CA 94945", "Artist": "Von Zippers", "ArtistBio": "Flashback covers of Old School New Wave/Alt-Rock/Power Pop classics (circa 1979-1999) for fine folk who still love dancin' & singin' along to real fun footstompin' live m...", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9130456.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.55345, 38.088411], "Date": "Sat Aug 31 2019", "EventDate": "2019-08-31", "Genre": "Genres: New Wave, Alternative, Indie, Power Pop, Ska, Pub Rock, First Wave, Alterna-Pop, Rock, 80s, 90s, Cover Band", "OtherInfo": "Heavy Petty | U2Boy | Von Zippers", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Hopmonk Tavern"}, {"Address": "1710 Mission St, Sf, CA 94103", "Artist": "KOTA The Friend", "ArtistBio": "KOTA The Friend is an artist from the downtown section of Brooklyn, New York.
