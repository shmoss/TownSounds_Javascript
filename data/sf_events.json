His grandparents played a variety of instruments; his mother played piano; and his father taught music and was a choir director. In addition to possessing a natural ability to sing, Aweau\u2019s early years consisted of piano, guitar, and \u2018ukulele lessons, followed by saxophone, percussion, and bass.\n\nHe began his professional career in college, accompanying such well-known performers as Gabe Baltazar, Henry Kapono, Loyal Garner, and Nohelani Cypriano, followed by stints as a member of the award-winning groups Ka`eo (1984-1988), The Ali\u2019i\u2019s (1989-1994), and Hapa (2003-2010). He was also the musical director for the legendary Don Ho for 16 years, and has worked with national artists such as Jerry Brown (drummer for Lionel Richie and Stanley Clarke), and Ron Lee (drummer for Barry Manilow).\n\nAweau also taught music at high school and college seminars, covering subjects ranging from writing, arranging, and sequencing to computer music. In one project he gave Hawai\u2019i high school students the chance to experience the process of producing and recording a song.\n\nIn addition to being a stage musician, Aweau has played for a variety of commercials and provided background music for a number of shows on the Travel Channel. A seasoned music producer, he has worked extensively in the studio producing, arranging, and performing for various large projects, commercials, radio stations, and other artists.\n\nBeloved by fans, Aweau is a natural storyteller with a somewhat self-deprecating sense of humor. His audiences love his explanations of the inspiration behind his songs. He is also highly respected by fellow musicians. The late John Koko, long-time member of the highly popular, multiple-award winning Hawaiian music group The Makaha Sons, once said, \u201cNathan Aweau ... Incredible Bass Player \u2026 Irresistible Voice... Incomparable Entertainer! The CD \u2018Kane`ohe\u2019 will take you on a musical journey that is Haunting...Refreshing... Powerful and Exciting.\u201d\n\nThe respect of other professionals in the music industry is also evidenced by the fact that Aweau has received numerous nominations and awards for his work, both as a solo artist and as part of a group. His 2001 release E Apo Mai received multiple N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards (Hawaii\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae), including Male Vocalist of the Year and Hawaiian Album of the Year. He also received Song of the Year honors at the Hawai\u2019i Music Awards for the album\u2019s title track.\n\n2005 saw Aweau again honored with multiple awards, as both a solo artist and as part of the group Hapa. His passion for the electric bass was expressed in his Bass Etude CD, which was voted Jazz Album of the Year. And Hapa\u2019s Maui CD, which shot up Billboard\u2019s World Music chart (peaking at number 7), received awards for Album of the Year, Contemporary Album of the Year, Graphics, and Engineering. Aweau was also honored with his second award for Male Vocalist of the Year for his album The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series - Vintage.\n\nIn 2006 Aweau received his third Male Vocalist of the Year award, for his The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series \u2013 Hula CD. In the 39 year history of the N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards, he remains the only artist to receive the honor three times.\n\nIn 2008 Aweau released \u201cKane\u2019ohe\u201d - the long-awaited follow up to \u201cE Apo Mai\u201d \u2013 which was comprised of songs that celebrate the place that he calls home. He wrote all twelve songs, played every instrument, sang all the background parts, and engineered, mixed, and mastered the entire CD.\n\nHis December 2015 release \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is yet another all-original album, filled with songs inspired by his beloved Hawai\u2019i, his first grandchild, Queen Lili\u2019uokalani, and more. As was the case for his other solo releases, \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is 100% Aweau.

His professional career started in 1996 when he met Marco Passarani from Nature records and together they decided to start a series of projects: releases, radio-show and organization of parties.\n\nAt the beginning the first musical project was called MAT101 and it was realized with Mario Pierro (aka Raider of The Lost ARP) and Emiliano Tortora who lately decided to split from the band. They've released an album and a couple of singles that helped them to become popular in the electronic underground movement. So far they've collected many live performances, many tracks on compilations and remixes using the name MAT101.\n\nAfter 3 years MAT101 decided to start another project called JOLLY MUSIC: While MAT101 is more electro oriented, JOLLY MUSIC is more into psychedelic disco and electroacoustic soul. The first track came out on a FINALFRONTIER 12\" sampler with tracks from the rest of the NATURE RECORDS crew and it did get the attention of the most respected underground crews. Then a couple of singles came out in order to anticipate the full lenght album called ?Jolly Bar?. As soon as the album came out the reaction from the press was very strong: from England to Italy, from Japan to Germany the specialized magazine where shouting like ?one of the most original record of the year?. After a short while Nature records licensed this album to Sony UK, and even if the end of the story was pretty sad, with the major label not releasing the album, the duo had the chance to experience a great adventure working with some very talented singers (such as Erlend Oye from Kings of Convenience and Sonya Madden from Echobelly) and producers (such as Steve Dub of Chemical Brothers and New Order fame).\nMeanwhile the Jolly guys have been touring for promotion some clubs in the UK (The End, Heaven, the Bugged out nights in Manchester and Glasgow) and they've added two big names in the remix field of their bio: Jamiroquai (accepted by the artist, but never released by the label) and Garbage.\n\nFrancisco is one of the most eclectic dance artist that have been working in the italian scene, especially because of his fresh and quircky sound made of italodisco, funk and old school chicago house: so many djs from italy and europe have noticed his music just after the release of his first two solo records, Salvation / Pigna 002 and Fregna / Pigna 005.\n\nFrancisco's music has been featured on many compilations like the one mixed by Dr. Electroluv or the ones issued by the famous british dance magazines Jockey Slut and Dj Magazine. Francisco is ready now to step ahead introducing his new works with an upcoming single on Nature called \"Moon Roller\" followed then by a full lenght album called \"Music Business\", and both works will show that he represents the heritage of the purest italo disco. His show is made of humor and groove, all based on a perfect mixing tecnique that has been acknowledged during the many experiences on the road thanks to his previous projects such as Mat101 and Jollymusic.", "otherInfo": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Grimaud -- equal parts agile, independent, and elegant -- takes center stage in a crowd-pleasing piano recital that highlights her breathtaking intuition and inventiveness.

He later learned to play drums, guitar and developed his vocal and songwriting technique.\n\nHe moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1995 where as a sideman violinist he began supporting local Bay Area bands, playing some of the area's better known venues including the Fillmore, Yoshi's SF (main stage), Slim\u2019s, The Independent and The Sweetwater.\n\nWhen Adrian began performing solo, he combined violin, guitar, mandolin, beatboxing and vocals into a live performance that relied heavily on 'looping'. He recorded an all-instrumental demo CD called The One-Man String Quartet which got airplay on Keller Williams' nationally syndicated radio show Keller's Cellar, as well as on Derk Richardson's Hear and Now show on KPFA in Berkeley.\n\nIn 2005 he formed the Adrian West Trio and in 2010 he released his first full-length CD Chameleons and Butterflies.\n\nSince then the band has performed at small venues and festivals all over the Bay Area.\n\nRecently Adrian combined his love of music with his love of science in a multimedia show called An Evening of Music & Science which weaves his music with synchronized videos and presentations on the subject of how life began on Earth.

Amendola continues to tour and record with the volatile instrumental band, The Nels Cline Singers, which is due for a follow up to 2014\u2019s critically hailed, genre-obliterating Macroscope (Mack Avenue).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Singers provided an early and essential forum for Amendola\u2019s artful use of electronics, a small menagerie of devices that has found its way \u201cinto everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter years of experimenting I\u2019m using them in a more expressive and confident way than ever before.\u201d\n\nCline was still an underground LA legend in the mid-1990s when he first encountered Amendola and was \u201cblown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many drummers on the West Coast who had his wide-ranging ability. Scott\u2019s got some funk in him, a looser, sexy thing going on, and the flexibility to play free and different styles. He plays behind singer/songwriters and he rocks too.\u201d\n\nScott also performs widely with his longtime sparring partner Wil Blades in the orchestral duo Amendola Vs. Blades. While they\u2019ve honed a wide array of material, the project initially centered on their thrilling investigation of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cFar East Suite.\u201d Their 2016 debut album Greatest Hits (Sazi Records) earned lavish critical praise, with the San Jose Mercury News hailing the duo for honing a \u201crepertoire of groovelicious jazz for more than a decade, and they throw down the funk with fervor on a project that clocks in at the old-school LP length of 39 minutes, distilling some of their leanest, meanest, punchiest pieces.\u201d\n\nNo project better displays Amendola\u2019s big ears and musical ambitions than Fade To Orange a piece commissioned as part of the Oakland East Bay Symphony\u2019s Irvine Foundation-funded New Visions/New Vistas Initiative. The roiling work premiered to critical acclaim at Oakland\u2019s Paramount Theater on April 15, 2011. Determined to refine and document the piece, Amendola conducted a successful PledgeMusic crowd-funding campaign and recorded Fade To Orange at Berkeley\u2019s storied Fantasy Studios with his original collaborators\u2014his Nels Cline Singers bandmates (Cline and powerhouse bassist Trevor Dunn)\u2014and the great Magik*Magik Orchestra.\n\n\u201cThe idea was really the Singers meet the Symphony,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cI wanted Trevor\u2019s electric bass for that big contrast with the orchestra, and I conceived of the piece as a concerto for guitar. It was an amazing experience to premiere \u2018Fade to Orange\u2019 at the Paramount, but it was bittersweet after all that work. Like, that\u2019s it? I wanted to see what else we could do with it.\u201d\nHe released Fade to Orange on CD and vinyl on his label Sazi Records in 2015. The album includes four distilled, wildly imaginative remixes of \u201cFade to Orange\u201d by Cibo Matto\u2019s Yuka Honda, Mocean Worker, Beautiful Bells, and Deerhoof\u2019s John Dieterich and Teetotum\u2019s Drake Hardin.\n\nAmendola established his reputation as a bandleader in 1999 with the release of the acclaimed album Scott Amendola Band featuring the unusual instrumentation of Eric Crystal on saxophones, Todd Sickafoose on acoustic bass, Jenny Scheinman on violin, and Dave Mac Nab on electric guitar. By the time the quintet returned to the studio in 2003, Cline had replaced Mac Nab, contributing to the quintet\u2019s combustible chemistry on the Cryptogramophone album Cry.\n\nCline was a crucial contributor on Amendola\u2019s 2005 Cryptogramophone album Believe, which also features guitarist Jeff Parker (from the band Tortoise), Jenny Scheinman, and late bassist John Shifflett. Scott created his own label, SAZi Records, for his next release, 2010\u2019s exquisite Lift, a trio session with Parker and Shifflett dedicated to his gossamer, bluesy ballads and ethereal soundscapes, with an occasional foray into surf rock deconstruction.\n\nIn some circles, Amendola is best known for his intermittent two-decade collaboration with seven-string guitar wizard Charlie Hunter, with whom he connected shortly after moving to the Bay Area in 1992. They went on to play together with John Schott and Will Bernard in the three-guitar-and-drums combo T.J. Kirk, which earned a Grammy nomination for its eponymous 1996 debut album. After years of occasional gigs, they teamed up again in 2011 in a tough and sinewy duo. They spent five years touring incessantly and released two acclaimed albums: 2012\u2019s recession-inspired Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead and 2013\u2019s Pucker, the latter showcases Amendola\u2019s melodically inspired tunes.\n\nIn 2014, looking for new avenues to distribute their music, Hunter and Amendola released four 5-track EPs, each focusing on the music of a particular artist or act. From the standards of Ellington and Cole Porter to the country hits of Hank Williams and seminal new wave tunes of The Cars, the duo transformed everything they encountered with their groove-centric sensibility.\n\nAs a sideman, Amendola has performed and recorded with a vast, stylistically varied roster of artists, including Bill Frisell, John Zorn, Mike Patton, Mondo Cane, John Scofield, Cibo Matto, John Dieterich from Deerhoof, Wadada Leo Smith, Bruce Cockburn, Madeleine Peyroux, Cris Williamson, Joan Osborne, Jacky Terrasson, Shweta Jhaveri, Phil Lesh, Sex Mob, Kelly Joe Phelps, Larry Klein, Carla Bozulich, Wayne Horvitz, Johnny Griffin, Julian Priester, Sonny Simmons, Pat Martino, Jim Campilongo, Bobby Black, Larry Goldings, Paul McCandless, Rebecca Pidgeon, and the Joe Goode Dance Group.\n\nBorn and raised in the New Jersey suburb of Tenafly, just a stone\u2019s throw from New York City, Amendola displayed an aptitude for rhythm almost from the moment he could walk. His grandfather, Tony Gottuso, was a highly respected guitarist who performed with jazz luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. A member of the original Tonight Show Band under Steve Allen, he offered plenty of support when Amendola began to get interested in jazz.\n\u201cWe used to play together a lot when I was a teenager,\u201d Amendola says. \u201cIt had a huge impact on me to play with someone who was around when a lot of the standards that musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett play were written.\u201d\n\nHis passion for music only deepened during his four years at Boston\u2019s venerable Berklee College of Music, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to practice for 12 hours a day. Drawing inspiration from fellow students such as Jorge Rossi, Jim Black, Danilo Perez, Chris Cheek, and Mark Turner, and studying with the likes of Joe Hunt, and Tommy Campbell, Amendola found his own voice rather than modeling himself after established drummers. Since 2014, Scott has served as Associate Professor at the University of California - Berkeley\u2019s Jazz Program. His teaching in Jazz Percussion focuses on private instruction.\n\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Amendola has forged deep ties across the country, and throughout the world. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist, and capaciously creative foil for some of the world\u2019s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. He\u2019s never more than one degree away from a powerful musical hook-up.", "otherInfo": "Phillip: reeds\nScott:drums/percussion/electronics\n\nThe Monday Make-Out II ~ Cutting edge Bay Area jazz and improvised music-- 8pm ~ No Cover ~ Donations Accepted"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Vanishing twin", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Mon Mar 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "VANISHING TWIN\nSonoda\nabracadabra\n8 pm\n$15 adv / $18 doors\nAll Ages"}, {"Address": "500 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "M.O.M.", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.437364, 37.774222], "Date": "Mon Mar 23 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-23", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Madrone Art Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "\"M.O.M.

Several demos, a few years, a new group name, and additional members later, the direction of the crew took its turn towards blending science fiction and conspiracy theories into rap songs, which at the time, was a rare take on hip hop music in the early 90s. In 1994, the early \"Demigodz\" group split up due to the ever-so-popular break up reason: \"musical differences\". However, it was through this transition that the Demigodfather met another fellow CT lyricist, Apathy. As the musical partnership between Open Mic and Apathy progressed, the two decided to rebuild the Demigodz name and take their aspirations to an entirely different level. After years of recording songs, mastering the ASR-10, co-hosting a radio show, and gaining ties with the likes of Alien Nation, Mothership aka Eternia, and Al T of Newcleus, Mic's dues were slowly but surely being paid. Along with Apathy, he also headed up a Connecticut based chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation and recorded the cassette-only \"Sureshot Affair\" EP, which was self-released in 1997 and sold throughout the underground circles of the North East. Shortly thereafter, Mic took a step back from the scene after getting married and becoming a father for the first time in his life... In 2000, the Demigodz became resurrected by Apathy and expanded into a military-like squadron of MCs and DJs. With that movement in motion, it couldn't have existed without the inclusion of its original creator, Open Mic, and once again he became immersed into the hip hop world. Since then, Mic has kept himself afloat by making appearances on wax, including \"Science of the Bumrush\" on UK-based Stonegroove Recordings and the Demigodz EP released on Ill Boogie Records in mid-2002, all of which received critical acclaim in such publications as XXL and The Source. Outside of the microphone realm, he has made quite a name for himself over the years as a professional graphic designer, in which his lengthy resume extends widely with the creation of many 12\" single, vinyl album, and CD covers for an extensive list of labels - beginning with Bronx Science Records (Apathy's first label), Raptivism Records, Domination Recordings and most recently Babygrande. In early 2006, after being reunited with early 'Nobility' member and co-founder of the first generation of the Demigodz, P-Air, Open Mic has begun work on a new duo project. Returning to his original group base from 1989-1990, and bringing back that boom-bap early 90's sound that hip-hop has lacked since it took a commercial nosedive, Open Mic is ready to deliver what many Demigodz fans have been asking for.... the real raw shit. Keep your eyes open for the debut of his new group the \"Megadonz\" in late 2007.\n\nFor more info on MEGADONZ check out their MySpace page at:\nwww.myspace.com/megadonzmusic", "otherInfo": "Open Mic with Brendan Getzell at Hotel Utah: The Old West and indie music come together at the Hotel Utah Saloon, where a small stage, an antique bar, and a diversely stocked jukebox set the scene.

Those years were among the most tumultuous our country has ever seen and the duality between the generally positive state of affairs within our band while watching so many things we care about being decimated and destroyed all around us informed the writing of this album to the core.\n\nWhile a quick glance might imply that we\u2019re picking up where 2016\u2019s American Band album left off, the differences are as telling as the similarities. If the last one was a warning shot hinting at a coming storm, this one was written in the wreckage and aftermath. I\u2019ve always said that all of our records are political but I\u2019ve also said that \u2018politics IS personal\u2019. With that in mind, this album is especially personal.\n\nOur 2018 single \u201cThe Perilous Night\u201d acted as a sort of coda to the polemic of the last album and the original plan was to zigzag in a different direction, but alas the past few years have seen an uptick in school shootings, church shootings, racial violence, suicides and overdoses, border violence, and an assault on so many things that we all hold dear. They\u2019re literally putting children in cages. Writing silly love songs just seemed the height of privilege.\n\nMy partner Mike Cooley and I both worked through deep pools of writer\u2019s block. How do you put these day to day things we\u2019re all living through into the form of a song that we (much less anybody else) would ever want to listen to? How do you write about the daily absurdities when you can\u2019t even wrap your head around them in the first place? I think our response was to focus at the core emotional level. More heart and less cerebral perhaps.\n\nEventually the songs did come, some in mysterious ways. A day-long layover at an exit outside of Gillette, Wyoming resulted in \u201c21st Century USA\u201d, the song that for me opened up the floodgates, enabling me to write my portion of the album.\n\nI wrote \u201cBabies in Cages\u201d in the living room of my wife\u2019s parent\u2019s house and quickly demoed it on my phone. A portion of that original recording acts as the introduction to the version on the album. Cooley wrote \u201cGrievance Merchants\u201d about the proliferation of white supremacist violence we\u2019ve seen in recent years. Our family\u2019s babysitter\u2019s best friend was murdered on a train in beautiful progressive Portland, Oregon in one such incident. The political is indeed very personal.\n\n\u201cArmageddon\u2019s Back in Town\u201d takes a whirlwind joyride through the daily whiplash of events we are collectively dealing with, while \u201cSlow Ride Argument\u201d offers an unorthodox but hopefully effective method of the prevailing of cooler heads. Perhaps it should come with a disclaimer though.\n\nMeanwhile \u201cAwaiting Resurrection\u201d dives headfirst into the void of despair and painful realities these times are tolling. It\u2019s a song unlike any in our band\u2019s history, yet somehow quintessentially DBT to the core. A call to deal, unblinkingly, with the horrors surrounding us all, but to also survive, with perhaps even a hint of optimism.\n\n\u201cIn the end we\u2019re just standing, watching greatness fade into darkness /\nAwaiting Resurrection\u201d\n\nIf the writing was a long and brutal process, the recording was a joyous celebration. Another of our band\u2019s many dualities, perhaps.\n\nWe convened for a week in Memphis, Tennessee at the historic and wonderful Sam Phillips Recording Service. We tracked, mostly live in the studio, aided by long-time producer David Barbe and famed engineer Matt Ross-Spang. Initially recording 18 songs in 85 hours of near around the clock sessions, the band essentially spent the whole week in an artistic marathon, housing ourselves at the Memphis Music Mansion (AirBnB), surrounded by historic photos and a mid-century vibe that seemed to even seep into our dreams each night. (My bedroom was, fittingly, The Big Star Room, named after the seminal Memphis power pop band that I have always held as an all-time favorite).\n\nRecording in Memphis has been a life-long dream for this band. Both the city, with its dark social history and amazing musical heritage, and the studio which is a time machine set to its early 1960\u2019s origins and inhabited by the spirit of its genus founder, affected and inspired the creation of this album in ways that go far beyond the tangible and technical.\n\nSam Phillips left my hometown of Florence, Alabama and moved to Memphis, working in radio before opening the legendary Sun Studios (Memphis Recording Service) where he essentially discovered Rock and Roll, recording the first records of Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Ike Turner, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Charlie Rich, and of course Elvis Presley. When he sold Sun, he built his dream lair, the, then state of the art Sam Phillips Recording Service which opened in 1962. If Phillips\u2019 love of \u2018slap-back\u2019 echo had given those early Sun records their legendary sound, his new studio incorporated three different echo chambers into its design, giving the studio a very unique and wonderful sound that we incorporated into this album.\n\nI can\u2019t impart enough the impact that recording there had on this album. We were all beyond inspired by the surroundings and the sounds coming out of the speakers from every playback or the sound of the echo chambers reverberating down the halls. Every day we got to hang out with Sam\u2019s son Jerry who took us up to Mr. Phillips\u2019 old office on the third floor. Unlocked in time, it was still exactly as it had been the last day Sam spent there. His jackets still hanging in the closet and the bar still stocked with his favorite whiskey. There, with Jerry, we toasted our recordings and the spirits that still inhabited that sacred space.\n\nIn honor of finally getting to record in Memphis, I wrote \u201cRosemary with a Bible and a Gun\u201d, a sort of stream of conscious love song to that dark and mythical city on the banks of the Mississippi. Although the song isn\u2019t a literal story of such, it was certainly informed by the brutal times Cooley and I had in 1991 when we followed Sam Phillips\u2019 example and moved from Florence to Memphis in search of dreams that for us were still to be over a decade in coming. I heard the song in my head as a sort of Bobbie Gentry inspired southern gothic and we further explored that by adding gorgeous strings by Kyleen and Patti King (arranged by Kyleen). It seemed the perfect way to kick off this album.\n\nOur sessions were rounded out by a guest appearance from Cody Dickinson (North Mississippi All Stars) who came in and played an electric washboard through an Echoplex and wah-pedal into an amp for \u201cBabies in Cages\u201d. The song, recorded completely live, in one magical take, perfectly captured the mood and tone of the week we spent there. (We even kept the scratch vocal since it had so much live bleed from the take). The following day, Mick Jagger came by, but alas we weren\u2019t able to record with him, although his presence certainly added to the already surreal vibe of the week.\n\nA few months later we reconvened in Athens, Georgia at Barbe\u2019s Chase Park Transduction studios where Matt and David mixed the album on Barbe\u2019s vintage 1975 Neve console. As a band that got its start essentially making albums as field recordings on mobile gear, it is indeed a treat to get to make our albums on 2\u201d 16 tracks tape in historic studios and on beautiful vintage gear. We finished the process by having the legendary Greg Calbi master it all at Sterling Sound in Edgewater, New Jersey.\n\nIn the end, we whittled the album down to the nine songs included, saving several key songs for a foundation to the next one that will hopefully occur sooner than later. Lilla Hood designed the packaging utilizing a stunning photo by Erik Golts of two young lads watching a sunset at the Oregon coast, lettering by famed graphic artist Aaron Draplin, and once again beautiful artwork from our long time collaborator Wes Freed. We plan on touring extensively throughout the next year taking these songs around the world.\n\nWe hope to see you there.\n\n- Patterson Hood\n\n\nWe are beyond thrilled to announce the release date of our new album American Band.\nWe are launching a PRE ORDER and our friends at NPR are posting a first taste so you can get a little sample of what we've been up to.\n\n\"Surrender Under Protest\" is a Mike Cooley composition that is unlike any DBT song we've ever recorded, yet somehow sounds unmistakably like us. In a way, that's pretty indicative of the album as a whole.\n\nThese are crazy times and we have made a record steeped in this moment of history that we're all trying to live through. We've always considered ourselves a political band, even when that aspect seemed to be concealed by some type of narrative device i.e. Dealing with issues of race by telling a story set in the time of George Wallace or class struggles by setting \"Putting People of the Moon\" in the age of Reagan.\n\nThis time out, there are no such diversions as these songs are mostly set front and center in the current political arena with songs dealing with our racial and cultural divisions, gun violence, mass shootings and political assholery. Once again, there is a nearly even split between the songs of Cooley and myself, with both of us bringing in songs that seem to almost imply a conversation between us about our current place in time.\n\nAmerican Band is a sort of rock and roll call to arms as well as a musical reset button for our band and the country we live in. Most of all, we look at it as the beginnings of some conversations that we, as a people very much need to begin having if we ever hope to break through the divisions that are threatening to tear us apart.\n\nDrive-By Truckers are celebrating our twentieth anniversary as a band in an election year where some people are trying to define what it is to be American. Definitions based on some outdated ideology of prejudice and fear. We are loudly proclaiming that those people don't speak for us. America is and always has been a land of immigrants and ideals. Ideals that we have often fallen short of achieving, but it's the striving that has given us whatever claims to greatness we have had. That's what America means to us and \"We're an American Band'.\n\nAmerican Band - the eleventh studio album by Drive-By Truckers\nComing September 30th, 2016 from ATO Records.\n\nAnd don't miss the Darkened Flags 2016 Tour, beginning in August .\n\nSee you at The Rock Show,\nPatterson Hood\nDBT", "otherInfo": "Doors 7:30PM // Show 8:30PM // Ages 21+ // $36.50 Advance & $38.00 Day of Show"}, {"Address": "2236 Martin Luther King Junior Way, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Mal Blum", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9469843.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.2727, 37.81239], "Date": "Tue Mar 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-24", "Genre": "Folk, Songwriter, Singer", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Starline Social Club Crystal Cavern", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Mal Blum return to the Bay to celebrate their album 'Pity Boy', supported by Diners."}, {"Address": "116 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Seisiun", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.460518, 37.783375], "Date": "Tue Mar 24 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-24", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Plough & Stars", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Seisi\u00fan at Plough & Stars: Throwing back pints to a live soundtrack of traditional jigs and reels gives this Richmond watering hole a notably authentic Irish feel.

Consistent-that is-in that he\u2019s rarely consistent in what we\u2019ve come to expect from him. Constantly making unique inroads with many different styles of music, he has followed his particular muse in any way it leads him for almost three decades.\n\nAlthough heavy metal and progressive rock has always been his primary focus, each year that passes recently has resulted in new peripheral works that have seen him branch off to everything from country, new age, ambient noise or even orchestral musical theatre. As endearing as that has been to his constantly growing fanbase, it has also made it difficult to classify with much accuracy what he does and what he represents. Who is Devin Townsend? What is his musical identity? With his new album, \u2018EMPATH\u2019, we find that Devin Townsend is actually all of these things.\n\nOver the past few years, the success that Devin has slowly worked for has fortunately come with the power to control his own creative destiny. The recent successes with the DVD from a sold-out Royal Albert hall, or his 2012 \u2018Retinal Circus\u2019, or last year\u2019s \u2018Ocean Machine\u2019 live DVD with the Orchestra and Choir of State Opera Plovdiv has put him in a position where with the new album \u2018EMPATH\u2019, he will once and for all define himself as a musical force outside of any particular genre classification.\n\nThere has been a strangely conservative trend within the heavy music scene with the industry needing to define artists as one particular thing. Often that relegates musicians to boxes that are very limited. If you play heavy music, what genre of heavy music are you to be categorized under? If you play anything with a pop aesthetic, are you selling out? If you make beautiful chill sounds, and then promptly follow it with savage metal sounds, you are either viewed as doing it to be provocative, or that it\u2019s coming from an unfocussed vision. So what does one do if a single category does not contain the breadth of the expression that needs to come forth? If you have a history of heavy music -yet have skills that extend into different realms- getting any attention from those outside genres is next to impossible. You are automatically relegated to the metal world and that world alone. To be fair: EDM, Jazz, Classical, ultimately any genre\u2026the music world in general requires artists to \u2018stay in their lane\u2019 due to a need for categorization or simply the out of necessity due to the glut of albums released every month.\n\nSo what happens if you\u2019re an artist that simply uses \u2018genre\u2019 as colours in a wide palette? What happens if you\u2019re an artist like Devin Townsend with a history of musical knowledge and experience that extends far past the genre that made him famous? Furthermore: What if you think that Heavy Music is not something to be ashamed of, and you feel it deserves to fit into the typical fold of \u2018respected\u2019 music? It has been well known to those proficient in heavy music that it can represent emotions in ways that no other music can, and can add a dynamic to emotional music that makes the topics truly heavy. Devin has always had this ethos, and his fanbase has quietly followed him through a myriad of styles over the years where he has applied this.\n\nIf the desire (and the ability) to play different styles is not done to be provocative, but rather to illustrate a full spectrum of musical emotions, why would one not want to follow that?\n\nEnter \u2018EMPATH\u2019. Devin has decided to see what would happen if all the styles that make up his current interests were finally represented in one place. To finally shake the fear of expectation, and just do what it is he was meant to do creatively, \u2018EMPATH\u2019, true to the name, is about allowing the audience a feeling for a variety of musical emotions. The musical dynamics represented on this single album are broad, challenging, and immense. To approach this sort of work with a long history of what makes heavy music \u2018heavy\u2019, allows this to be done with a type of power rarely heard.\n\nThe theme of the work was based in participating with all of what makes life so simultaneously beautiful and challenging, and to not neither fear those things, nor let them define us. As much as this may sound like a confusing output, care was put into the trajectory of the album so that hopefully each section is \u2018welcomed\u2019 by the listener when it arrives. A roller coaster of emotion that makes each consecutive section that much more effective. Having a constant thread throughout makes it a thrilling and constantly interesting sonic experience. One that is very much rooted in the hope that through this work, it can be something that may inspire other musicians to do the same. This is not meant to be a \u2018glory project\u2019 rather; it is meant to be a celebration of the dynamics of what makes music interesting with great talent involved.\n\nIn what started as a clear vision several years ago, Devin realized that time was running out on the inspiration that had propelled \u2019The Devin Townsend Project\u2019. Although that band (and the series of records that bore its name) had seen his career surge in many fantastic ways, he knew that in order to proceed forward with his creative development, the band was limiting his ability to actualize what was becoming obvious he needed to pursue. When DTP disbanded at the end of 2017, there was concern that the decision was impulsive, rather than what it truly was: a strategic way to eliminate the parameters that being in a traditional rock band imposed on him.\n\nThe \u2018EMPATH\u2019 project and the massive amount of artists involved, was based in a need for total, uncompromising actualization of what he had been trying to achieve for much of his career. However, the ambition behind it required a strategy, so Devin began assembling a team of like-minded individuals to help him actualize this task in the most efficient ways possible. To create a completely over the top artistic statement that ultimately makes sense, yet also rings of hope in uncertain times, was a workload not to be taken lightly.\n\nIn an unexpected meeting with Frank Zappa Alumni and all around brilliant musical mind Mike Keneally, Devin began bouncing plans off of him as a friend until it became clear that Mikes mind was suited to help Devin organize the logistics of the project.\n\nIt began with the drummers, Devin had been writing ideas ranging from extreme metal, to prog, country, new age, orchestral and free jazz. All of which required the absolute best people for the job to not come off as a gimmick. Not content to find one drummer who would be pushed beyond his wheelhouse, Devin set out to find drummers that he could relegate certain songs and sections to from the large canon of music written during the \u2018EMPATH\u2019 period, and then track them in the best way possible. He chose Morgan \u00c5gren (Mats And Morgan, Frank Zappa, Fredrik Thordendal) for the improvisational, quiet and jazz portions of the album. Anup Sastry (Monuments, Periphery) for the prog metal pieces, and Samus Paulicelli (Decrepit Birth, Abigail Williams) for the full metal sections. Repeating the process that had resulted in pleasing drum sounds on his last album Transcendence, Devin enlisted Adam \u2018Nolly\u2019 Getgood to engineer the three drummers in order to achieve consistent results for what would undoubtedly end up being a monumental mixing task. The whole process was then taken to the famous Monnow Valley Studios in Wales, where Devin was joined by an army of talent. A host of engineers, technicians, the three drummers, an additional bassist by way of internet phenomenon Nathan Navarro as well as co-producer Mike Keneally. The studio was then set up as a residence studio, so the group lived in this fascinating UK location where artists such as Queen, Oasis, Black Sabbath (among many others) had recorded to great success. From there, the arduous task of making sense of music that would ultimately go between the lightest and the darkest sounds they could imagine would begin.\n\nThrough the entire process, either intentionally or by happenstance, Devin found himself in contact with many brilliant and unpredictable collaborators and people willing to help and inspire. Among the list of people involved were Elliot Desagnes, Steve Vai, Chad Kroeger, Anneke Van Giersbergen, Ch\u00e9 Aimee Dorval, Ryan Dhale, the fabulous Elektra Women\u2019s Choir as well as several renowned orchestras from around the world. The process became increasingly more fantastic and eclectic the more it all began to grow and take shape.\n\nFor the conclusion of the process, for vibe, a cabin in the woods was rented and all the recording gear was then moved in. A host of interesting artists would come by out of either morbid curiosity or simple interest and end up participating in the record. Devin\u2019s focus during this process was firmly rooted in his desire to not only- once and for all- make the statement he had been trying to \u2018get right\u2019 in the past, but also do it with a sense of joy and intention that was rooted in helping people and staying emotionally centred throughout. In a time of history where empathy is viewed as a weakness, the idea was to create songs of wildly varying styles to represent the need to view life from ALL its angles. To participate in these many musical emotions was about breaking away from the fears that he felt had held him in one place for so long creatively.\n\nTo make an analogy with the album that in order to understand others in this increasingly divisive time, we need to be willing to see things from other emotional points of view, was very important to this process.\n\nThe final stages of the album were when the true colours of it all began to appear. After spending a lot of time (and resources) to try and mix this massive statement with several different engineers, Devin realized that this project was not like others, and could not simply be mixed in one way. Typically, mixing nowadays relies on several techniques that, as cool as they sound, simply limit the dynamics of the material. At one moment it\u2019s a metal record, then it\u2019s a prog record, then it\u2019s a jazz record, then it\u2019s a pop record\u2026to mix and master that takes many mix styles with great attention to detail and obsessive tweaking. Devin ended up mixing it himself and the result is an truly accurate representation of what the project was meant to achieve, with a depth to the sonics that only a great deal of care can produce.\n\nIn the past, Devin has been told that it is simply \u2018not possible\u2019 to do all these different styles of music in one place, yet with a newfound success and significant support from the industry, he was determined to prove that not only can it be done, but in a musical climate where taking chances is typically seen as \u2018unwise\u2019, it could be done with supreme confidence and absolute lack of compromise.\n\nDevin Townsend / HevyDevy Records, InsideOut Music and Northern Music bring you \u2018EMPATH\u2019: A bold statement with massive production values and dynamic, uncompromised musicality. This is a statement about not only pursuing creative freedom in a conservative scene, but also trying to show that heavy music is truly a valid musical tool.", "otherInfo": "It is with immense disappointment that I have been put in the position to announce the postponement of the remaining dates on my Empath Vol. 1 North American Tour due to Corona Virus.\n\nWith the travel ban In effect from Europe and the consequent chaos that has brought to travel plans, as well as the increasing social unrest, combined with the fact that half of this crew is either European or from the UK, it put us in a tenuous position.

The name \u201cTara\u201d in Buddhist lore refers to the \u201cmother of liberation,\u201d an apt archetypal reference for such a strong and shamanistic female artist.\n\nTarah Who? recalls 1990s alt-rock and grunge\u2019s tradition of balancing integrity with tuneful songcraft. Entries in the Tarah Who? oeuvre sit nicely alongside Alanis Morissette, Foo fighters, The Distillers, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Spinerette.\n\nTarah Who? is a power trio in every sense of the phrase, bonded together by telepathic musical interplay and profound interpersonal connections. In addition to Tarah, the three-piece band also features bassist/backing vocalist Joey Southern, and drummer/backing vocalist Coralie Herv\u00e9. Previously, Tarah Who? has released two full-lengths, two EPs, and one single of raw punky rock n\u2019 roll. The band\u2019s output has garnered plaudits and earned feature-story coverage from GIG Radar, Kill The Music, La Grosse Radio, Loud Stuff, Moshville, Music Connection, Muzak, and The Ring Master, among other outlets.\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkable feat for an unsigned band to make such waves in the biz, but Tarah Who?\u2019s incendiary live shows and snarling sing-alongs are hard to ignore. Even alt-pop goddess Alanis Morissette\u2019s guitarist Jason Orme has given a big stamp approval to the group, co-producing and playing guitar alongside Tarah on the recently released EP, Half Middle Child Syndrome. Jason will also be onboard for the band\u2019s upcoming EP.\n\nWith a stable lineup, and a dynamic rhythm section that can effortlessly shift from scorched-earth rock to tender balladry, the band is embarking on a halcyon era ushered in by its current EP, Half Middle Child Syndrome. The EP\u2019s name is a cheeky reference to how outsiders sometimes try to make sense of Tarah\u2019s interior landscape.\n\nThe fiery EP brims with tunefully tormented songcraft. A live favorite on the EP,\u201c Ache,\u201d is built around an ultra-catchy bashed-out punk riff that recalls Nirvana\u2019s irresistible rage. Beneath the maelstrom of the music is a vulnerable admission of pain over manipulated miscommunication accusations. \"Garden of Chlo\u00e9(s)\u201d showcases Tarah\u2019s gift for melding soulfully melodic vocals with bold and raw lyrics. Here, she grapples with the suicides of two friends named Chlo\u00e9. Other EP highlights include the vitriolic punk of \u201cPay to Play,\u201d and the sweetly seething mid-tempo alt-rocker \u201cLittle Pieces.\u201d\n\nTarah was born in France and began smashing away at the drums at just 14, ignoring those around her who suggested she try her hand at a more \u201cladylike\u201d musical pursuit. Willful, and somewhat stubborn, she honed her chops, forged her own creative path, and branched out to bass, guitar, singing, songwriting, and producing (she produced the band\u2019s EP alongside Jason).\n\nAfter a fateful move to Los Angeles, Tarah made her solo debut as Tarah Who? at a warehouse party. It was a gig she found on Craigslist, and it proved to be the perfect opportunity to share the songs she had been writing privately. After the gig was well-received, Tarah decided to form a band to enhance and support her songs.\n\nUp next, the trio is roaring to get back into the studio with Jason. The band is fired up, inspired, and tighter as friends and musicians. In closing, bassist Joey offers this final thought: \u201cWhen I first met Tarah, it floored me how bold she is; I felt this exuberance and fire from her. It reminded me of why I play music in the first place.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1233 17th St, San Francisco, CA 94107", "Artist": "Off", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.396415, 37.764922], "Date": "Wed Mar 25 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-25", "Genre": "Alternative, New Wave Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Bottom Of the Hill", "moreBioInfo": "There are 2 artists with the name \"OFF\":\n\n1)Brazilian power pop punk band founded in 2007 making it's way trough independent-music scene in Brazil.\n\n2)OFF was an Eurodisco-project and important member of the \"Sound of Frankfurt\".

That year the second single \"Electrica Salsa\" was released. This song was very successful in the charts in Germany, Austria, France and Italy. Suddenly, Sven V\u00e4th was a pop star. Electrica Salsa was immediately marketed internationally and released on different labels.\n\nAlso in 1986 the project \"16 Bit\" 16 BIT was started by Michael M\u00fcnzing und Luca Anzilotti. The songs \"Where are you?\" and \"Changing Minds\", with the voice of Sven V\u00e4th were succesful in the charts.\n\nIn 1987 the singles Step By Step, Harry ... Aber Jetzt and Timeoperator were released, but none of these reached the success of Electrica Salsa.\n\nIn november 1987 the first OFF album appears: \"Organisation For Fun\". In England this album is quite successful, but goes unnoticed in Germany. In the end of 1988 the next OFF-Single \"La Casa Latina\" is released, an attempt to bring the populair Acid-bandwagon to Germany - it is also the last production involving Sven V\u00e4th, Michael M\u00fcnzing and Luca Anzilotti.\n\nIn 1989 the success of the Acid-sound fades quicky and more ambient House-sounds are popular. Sven V\u00e4th ends the cooperation with Michael M\u00fcnzing and Luca Anzilotti. Together with Matthias Hoffmann he produces the second and last OFF-Album \"Ask Yourself\".

His improvising style was initially influenced by guitarists such as Pat Metheny and John Scofield, but has emerged as an individual stylist whose lines are lengthy and linear, recalling the styles of Lennie Tristano in the 1940s and 50s. His chordal language is amongst the more advanced for a guitarist, touching on ideas from George Van Eps and Ben Monder. He attended the Berklee School of Music for two and a half years before leaving in his sophomore year to tour with Gary Burton, the dean of the school at the time. Subsequently, he moved to Brooklyn where he continued to develop as one of the leading jazz guitarists of his generation by performing with the Human Feel, Paul Motian's Electric Bebop Band, Joe Henderson Group, and the Brian Blade Fellowship. In 1995 he won the Composer's Award from the National Endowment for the Arts and was eventually signed by Verve Records. Since then he has played and recorded as both a leader and sideman with fellow-alumni such as Mark Turner and Brad Mehldau as well as many others. His latest album, Deep Song (2005), features Mehldau and Joshua Redman.

Perhaps his near-manic recording and touring schedule was prologue that has led to the relatable sensitivity that is this album.\n\n\u201cThis record feels like a new direction,\u201d Putnam says.\n\nRecording at home on the fly, and skipping his usual demo and pre-production process, has allowed Putnam to maintain a spontaneous feeling that informs these songs, and obviously kept him from overthinking lyrics or anything else that stood in the way of a group of tunes that could be called \u201craw\u201d if Putnam wasn\u2019t so good at producing himself and if the word \u201craw\u201d didn\u2019t scream \u201cunder produced.\u201d\n\nThat is to say: these songs sound great.\n\nPutnam claims that the work on Anticipation Pops represent a thematic \u201cconsistent inconsistency,\u201d different from his more planned past albums. And while he dials that back when he agrees that the album is cohesive, he\u2019s either being modest, or is far enough outside of his comfort zone now not to notice that Anticipation Pops is actually his most thematic record of all.\n\nWriting ten personal songs from a unique perspective, but relatable to everyone, is an artistic goal most songwriters never achieve. True to Putnam\u2019s attitude of throwing caution to the wind with this album, the first single is the record\u2019s aptly titled opening cut, \u201cI Don\u2019t Care,\u201d a two-minute gem that leaves \u2018em wanting more.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s something really special about a two-minute pop song,\u201d Putnam says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a shot of adrenaline.

Those years were among the most tumultuous our country has ever seen and the duality between the generally positive state of affairs within our band while watching so many things we care about being decimated and destroyed all around us informed the writing of this album to the core.\n\nWhile a quick glance might imply that we\u2019re picking up where 2016\u2019s American Band album left off, the differences are as telling as the similarities. If the last one was a warning shot hinting at a coming storm, this one was written in the wreckage and aftermath. I\u2019ve always said that all of our records are political but I\u2019ve also said that \u2018politics IS personal\u2019. With that in mind, this album is especially personal.\n\nOur 2018 single \u201cThe Perilous Night\u201d acted as a sort of coda to the polemic of the last album and the original plan was to zigzag in a different direction, but alas the past few years have seen an uptick in school shootings, church shootings, racial violence, suicides and overdoses, border violence, and an assault on so many things that we all hold dear. They\u2019re literally putting children in cages. Writing silly love songs just seemed the height of privilege.\n\nMy partner Mike Cooley and I both worked through deep pools of writer\u2019s block. How do you put these day to day things we\u2019re all living through into the form of a song that we (much less anybody else) would ever want to listen to? How do you write about the daily absurdities when you can\u2019t even wrap your head around them in the first place? I think our response was to focus at the core emotional level. More heart and less cerebral perhaps.\n\nEventually the songs did come, some in mysterious ways. A day-long layover at an exit outside of Gillette, Wyoming resulted in \u201c21st Century USA\u201d, the song that for me opened up the floodgates, enabling me to write my portion of the album.\n\nI wrote \u201cBabies in Cages\u201d in the living room of my wife\u2019s parent\u2019s house and quickly demoed it on my phone. A portion of that original recording acts as the introduction to the version on the album. Cooley wrote \u201cGrievance Merchants\u201d about the proliferation of white supremacist violence we\u2019ve seen in recent years. Our family\u2019s babysitter\u2019s best friend was murdered on a train in beautiful progressive Portland, Oregon in one such incident. The political is indeed very personal.\n\n\u201cArmageddon\u2019s Back in Town\u201d takes a whirlwind joyride through the daily whiplash of events we are collectively dealing with, while \u201cSlow Ride Argument\u201d offers an unorthodox but hopefully effective method of the prevailing of cooler heads. Perhaps it should come with a disclaimer though.\n\nMeanwhile \u201cAwaiting Resurrection\u201d dives headfirst into the void of despair and painful realities these times are tolling. It\u2019s a song unlike any in our band\u2019s history, yet somehow quintessentially DBT to the core. A call to deal, unblinkingly, with the horrors surrounding us all, but to also survive, with perhaps even a hint of optimism.\n\n\u201cIn the end we\u2019re just standing, watching greatness fade into darkness /\nAwaiting Resurrection\u201d\n\nIf the writing was a long and brutal process, the recording was a joyous celebration. Another of our band\u2019s many dualities, perhaps.\n\nWe convened for a week in Memphis, Tennessee at the historic and wonderful Sam Phillips Recording Service. We tracked, mostly live in the studio, aided by long-time producer David Barbe and famed engineer Matt Ross-Spang. Initially recording 18 songs in 85 hours of near around the clock sessions, the band essentially spent the whole week in an artistic marathon, housing ourselves at the Memphis Music Mansion (AirBnB), surrounded by historic photos and a mid-century vibe that seemed to even seep into our dreams each night. (My bedroom was, fittingly, The Big Star Room, named after the seminal Memphis power pop band that I have always held as an all-time favorite).\n\nRecording in Memphis has been a life-long dream for this band. Both the city, with its dark social history and amazing musical heritage, and the studio which is a time machine set to its early 1960\u2019s origins and inhabited by the spirit of its genus founder, affected and inspired the creation of this album in ways that go far beyond the tangible and technical.\n\nSam Phillips left my hometown of Florence, Alabama and moved to Memphis, working in radio before opening the legendary Sun Studios (Memphis Recording Service) where he essentially discovered Rock and Roll, recording the first records of Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Ike Turner, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Charlie Rich, and of course Elvis Presley. When he sold Sun, he built his dream lair, the, then state of the art Sam Phillips Recording Service which opened in 1962. If Phillips\u2019 love of \u2018slap-back\u2019 echo had given those early Sun records their legendary sound, his new studio incorporated three different echo chambers into its design, giving the studio a very unique and wonderful sound that we incorporated into this album.\n\nI can\u2019t impart enough the impact that recording there had on this album. We were all beyond inspired by the surroundings and the sounds coming out of the speakers from every playback or the sound of the echo chambers reverberating down the halls. Every day we got to hang out with Sam\u2019s son Jerry who took us up to Mr. Phillips\u2019 old office on the third floor. Unlocked in time, it was still exactly as it had been the last day Sam spent there. His jackets still hanging in the closet and the bar still stocked with his favorite whiskey. There, with Jerry, we toasted our recordings and the spirits that still inhabited that sacred space.\n\nIn honor of finally getting to record in Memphis, I wrote \u201cRosemary with a Bible and a Gun\u201d, a sort of stream of conscious love song to that dark and mythical city on the banks of the Mississippi. Although the song isn\u2019t a literal story of such, it was certainly informed by the brutal times Cooley and I had in 1991 when we followed Sam Phillips\u2019 example and moved from Florence to Memphis in search of dreams that for us were still to be over a decade in coming. I heard the song in my head as a sort of Bobbie Gentry inspired southern gothic and we further explored that by adding gorgeous strings by Kyleen and Patti King (arranged by Kyleen). It seemed the perfect way to kick off this album.\n\nOur sessions were rounded out by a guest appearance from Cody Dickinson (North Mississippi All Stars) who came in and played an electric washboard through an Echoplex and wah-pedal into an amp for \u201cBabies in Cages\u201d. The song, recorded completely live, in one magical take, perfectly captured the mood and tone of the week we spent there. (We even kept the scratch vocal since it had so much live bleed from the take). The following day, Mick Jagger came by, but alas we weren\u2019t able to record with him, although his presence certainly added to the already surreal vibe of the week.\n\nA few months later we reconvened in Athens, Georgia at Barbe\u2019s Chase Park Transduction studios where Matt and David mixed the album on Barbe\u2019s vintage 1975 Neve console. As a band that got its start essentially making albums as field recordings on mobile gear, it is indeed a treat to get to make our albums on 2\u201d 16 tracks tape in historic studios and on beautiful vintage gear. We finished the process by having the legendary Greg Calbi master it all at Sterling Sound in Edgewater, New Jersey.\n\nIn the end, we whittled the album down to the nine songs included, saving several key songs for a foundation to the next one that will hopefully occur sooner than later. Lilla Hood designed the packaging utilizing a stunning photo by Erik Golts of two young lads watching a sunset at the Oregon coast, lettering by famed graphic artist Aaron Draplin, and once again beautiful artwork from our long time collaborator Wes Freed. We plan on touring extensively throughout the next year taking these songs around the world.\n\nWe hope to see you there.\n\n- Patterson Hood\n\n\nWe are beyond thrilled to announce the release date of our new album American Band.\nWe are launching a PRE ORDER and our friends at NPR are posting a first taste so you can get a little sample of what we've been up to.\n\n\"Surrender Under Protest\" is a Mike Cooley composition that is unlike any DBT song we've ever recorded, yet somehow sounds unmistakably like us. In a way, that's pretty indicative of the album as a whole.\n\nThese are crazy times and we have made a record steeped in this moment of history that we're all trying to live through. We've always considered ourselves a political band, even when that aspect seemed to be concealed by some type of narrative device i.e. Dealing with issues of race by telling a story set in the time of George Wallace or class struggles by setting \"Putting People of the Moon\" in the age of Reagan.\n\nThis time out, there are no such diversions as these songs are mostly set front and center in the current political arena with songs dealing with our racial and cultural divisions, gun violence, mass shootings and political assholery. Once again, there is a nearly even split between the songs of Cooley and myself, with both of us bringing in songs that seem to almost imply a conversation between us about our current place in time.\n\nAmerican Band is a sort of rock and roll call to arms as well as a musical reset button for our band and the country we live in. Most of all, we look at it as the beginnings of some conversations that we, as a people very much need to begin having if we ever hope to break through the divisions that are threatening to tear us apart.\n\nDrive-By Truckers are celebrating our twentieth anniversary as a band in an election year where some people are trying to define what it is to be American. Definitions based on some outdated ideology of prejudice and fear. We are loudly proclaiming that those people don't speak for us. America is and always has been a land of immigrants and ideals. Ideals that we have often fallen short of achieving, but it's the striving that has given us whatever claims to greatness we have had. That's what America means to us and \"We're an American Band'.\n\nAmerican Band - the eleventh studio album by Drive-By Truckers\nComing September 30th, 2016 from ATO Records.\n\nAnd don't miss the Darkened Flags 2016 Tour, beginning in August .\n\nSee you at The Rock Show,\nPatterson Hood\nDBT", "otherInfo": "Doors open at 7pm All methods of delivery will be delayed until Thurs.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "19380 CA-12, Sonoma, CA 95476", "Artist": "Ellie James Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9109700.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.475271, 38.295674], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Indie Pop, Indie Folk, Dream Pop, Indie Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Starling Bar Sonoma", "moreBioInfo": "Stylistically unique and captivating, Ellie James mixes the darker, dreamier side of her California roots with the edge and dynamics of her Boston background.

His parents bought him his first guitar when he was 11 years old which quickly became his third arm. Marc has had a guitar in his hands ever since.\n\n\nAt age 13, his father saw such rapid progress that he sent him to the conservatory where he would study classical music. By then his mentors were Andres Segovia and John Williams.\n\n\nAt 17 he'd already won many prizes and started showing an interest in a variety of music genres including jazz, rock, Afro, pop, and more. At the same time he was playing in local bands in Britany (France).\n\n\nTragedy struck in the summer of 1981 when his debut career got cut short by a devastating accident to his left hand. The surgeon told him that his chances of playing guitar again were very slim and next to nothing. However, through the adversity, his love and passion for music helped him overcome this tragedy and in 1984 he was back on the scene in Paris, performing in clubs and recording for artists like Philippe Petit, Charlelie Couture, Jill Kaplan, France Gall, and Ray Lema.\n\n\nIn 1988 he moved to London where he joined Basia's band and worked with The Reggae Philharmonic Orchestra, Soul to Soul, Pato Banton, and General Public. He was also part of the London Acid Jazz scene. His world tour travelling lead him to spend time in Tokyo where he became an acclaimed session player.\n\n\nAs a true citizen of the world, Marc kept moving, this time to Los Angeles in the late 90's. He stayed there for 12 years playing for music royalty such as Sting, Celine Dion, Rod Stewart, Cher, Selena, Queen Latifah, George Benson, Guru Jazzmatazz, Take 6 and others. He composed and performed for major movie soundtracks: \"Get Shorty\"; \"The Fan\"; \"Patch Adams\"; \"Midnight In The Garden Of Good and Evil\"; \"Demolition Man\"; and \"Celtic Pride\". He also worked with producers of the likes of Tommy LiPuma, Philippe Saisse, Marcus Miller, Mike Pela, Guy Roche and Stoker.\n\n\nMost importantly, however, Marc began his successful solo career. His first album was \"Classical Soul\" NYC records 1994. Then came \"Urban Gypsy\" NYC 1995, \"Madrid\" GRP 1998, \"Universal Language\" GRP 2000, \"Cruisin'\" GRP 2001, \"The Very Best of Marc Antoine\" GRP 2002, \"Mediterraneo\" Rendezvous Entertainment 2003 and \"Modern Times\" Rendezvous Entertainment 2005.\n\n\nMarc's career boasts many #1 hits on the R&R contemporary jazz charts, as well as topping the Billboard charts.

Artists across the board have discovered Jacobs\u2019 musicianship and supple versatility, resulting in an impressive variety of formats in which he has played over the last few years. After a decade, five records, and 200 shows a year as principal songwriter and frontman for beloved Baltimore-based band The Bridge from 2001-2011, Jacobs wasted no time continuing to write music of his own and exploring different configurations for his craft. He released his debut solo album, Songs for Cats and Dogs, in 2012, and continued to perform relentlessly, both with his new band and as a solo artist. In doing so, he quickly garnered the admiration of a variety of predecessors and peers: rock legend Steve Winwood saw Jacobs perform in 2014 and soon invited him to open his national tour. The following year, Sturgill Simpson extended the same invitation. Never limited by genre, Jacobs and New Orleans heavyweight Ivan Neville recorded a collaborative album under the band name \u201cNeville Jacobs\u201d, which will be released in 2017. As an adapting, evolving, versatile musician who has survived on his own merit, Jacobs continues to win over audiences of many tastes, as he brings his characteristic authenticity and soul to every set.\n\nJacobs feels there are common threads across many genres of music, and he has harnessed over a decade of trans-genre exploration on his second solo album, Dust to Gold, released in 2016, from American Showplace Music. The album is a soul-stirring expression of the current chapter of his creative evolution, featuring twelve well-crafted songs that masterfully weave through the sweet and rugged landscape of soul, country, folk, blues, gospel, and rock and roll. Through every turn, one can easily feel Jacobs\u2019 reverence to his influences, but the result is an original, eclectic record with a sound that is authentically his. In a given moment, Jacobs\u2019 guitar playing is gritty, soulful, rich, and lyrical. It\u2019s subtle, yet adventurous. His voice is at once sweet and sultry, with a honeyed whiskey croon that delivers his thoughtful, expressive lyrics.\n\nI know that the well I seek is bound to be the deepest of all been ever told I know that to plant a seed is alchemy, we can watch the dust turn into gold\n\nSo sings the hypnotic refrain in \u201cTurn Into Gold\u201d, a meditative slide-guitar rocker where Jacobs sings about channeling the muse, or \u201ctapping the source\u201d, as he calls it. It\u2019s about the desire to be \u201cenraptured in the mystery, the unknown, the questions, the answers all at once,\u201d Jacobs describes. This is the place in which his songwriting occurs, and from where Jacobs\u2019 performances derive so much electricity. In discussing the song\u2019s inspiration, Jacobs reflects, \u201cif I\u2019m playing or singing and I\u2019m really connected to that source and I\u2019m really locked in and there\u2019s a room full of people experiencing that, the hope is then for them to get locked into their own thing, and it\u2019s this beautiful, ecstatic magic that happens. To me, this is that elusive goal that I chase every time I sit down to write a song or every time I get on stage to perform.\u201d\n\nOther songs on Dust to Gold paint Jacobs\u2019 desire to express the beauty and struggle of the human condition. In \u201cCold Carolina\u201d, Jacobs pleads softly and emotively about a despondent relationship, the feeling of displacement, and the seeking of redemption, of salvation. In \u201cLittle Dreamer\u201d, Jacobs, accompanied by his wife, Kat Jacobs, sings sweetly to their unborn child, whom he discovered was on the way only moments before leaving to start recording the album. \u201cIt\u2019s a blink of an eye, this life / tiny grains in sands of time / so tie your purposes on wings and fly to the heavens with the grace and courage of a thousand kings\u201d, he sings to the tiny, nascent being.\n\nThe opening track, \u201cThe Devil or Jesse James\u201d, is a rousing mixture of New Orleans rhythm, blues, and rock and roll with ethereal tendrils of psychedelic guitar reaching out across the soundscape; painting a tale of a man trying to change identities and run away from one\u2019s past. On the album, the full band includes a richly funky rhythm section, featuring Todd\n\nHerrington on bass, Dusty Ray Simmons on drums, as well as John Ginty on Hammond organ and keyboards, who has been a master side man for years, working with Robert Randolph and the Family Band, Jewel, Citizen Cope; and most currently tours with the Dixie Chicks.\n\nThough \u201cDust to Gold\u201d clearly showcases Jacobs\u2019 well-worn songwriting chops, he is an improviser at heart, and he brings the spirit of seeking and living in the moment to the stage each time. In every performance, he tries to push the envelope, exploring the depth of each song anew. Whether live or on the album, Jacobs\u2019 dynamic voice and guitar envelope the listener completely and instantly, transporting you into the rich, sultry folds of his soulful sound.\n\nCris Jacobs continues to nurture a devoted audience that knows that whatever the instrumentation or setting he plays, it will be richly authentic, and conveyed with an improviser\u2019s curious spirit and palpable presence. We can only expect further evolution from Jacobs, an artist constantly inspired by the search for \u201cthose beautiful, sad, inspiring, heartbreaking magical corners of life. The most rewarding, and terrifying part of trying to be an artist is the journey itself, the vulnerability and riskiness in seeking them out trying to express them. Sometimes you hit dead ends, and sometimes you strike pure gold.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Cris Jacobs Band w/ King Dream"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "Karyn Ann Music", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9886946.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463, 37.7648], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Pop Soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sofar Sounds", "moreBioInfo": "With a voice known to \"beguile the most inattentive bar-goer,\" Karyn Ann has gained notoriety as a skilled singer and songwriter, drawing comparisons to 60's troubadours like Bonnie Raitt and Carole King and modern artists like Adele and Brandi Carlile.\n\nShe tours nationally, and has notable appearances at the legendary Bitter End in NYC, the Reno Sculpture Fest and the Women's Redrock Music Festival.

His grandparents played a variety of instruments; his mother played piano; and his father taught music and was a choir director. In addition to possessing a natural ability to sing, Aweau\u2019s early years consisted of piano, guitar, and \u2018ukulele lessons, followed by saxophone, percussion, and bass.\n\nHe began his professional career in college, accompanying such well-known performers as Gabe Baltazar, Henry Kapono, Loyal Garner, and Nohelani Cypriano, followed by stints as a member of the award-winning groups Ka`eo (1984-1988), The Ali\u2019i\u2019s (1989-1994), and Hapa (2003-2010). He was also the musical director for the legendary Don Ho for 16 years, and has worked with national artists such as Jerry Brown (drummer for Lionel Richie and Stanley Clarke), and Ron Lee (drummer for Barry Manilow).\n\nAweau also taught music at high school and college seminars, covering subjects ranging from writing, arranging, and sequencing to computer music. In one project he gave Hawai\u2019i high school students the chance to experience the process of producing and recording a song.\n\nIn addition to being a stage musician, Aweau has played for a variety of commercials and provided background music for a number of shows on the Travel Channel. A seasoned music producer, he has worked extensively in the studio producing, arranging, and performing for various large projects, commercials, radio stations, and other artists.\n\nBeloved by fans, Aweau is a natural storyteller with a somewhat self-deprecating sense of humor. His audiences love his explanations of the inspiration behind his songs. He is also highly respected by fellow musicians. The late John Koko, long-time member of the highly popular, multiple-award winning Hawaiian music group The Makaha Sons, once said, \u201cNathan Aweau ... Incredible Bass Player \u2026 Irresistible Voice... Incomparable Entertainer! The CD \u2018Kane`ohe\u2019 will take you on a musical journey that is Haunting...Refreshing... Powerful and Exciting.\u201d\n\nThe respect of other professionals in the music industry is also evidenced by the fact that Aweau has received numerous nominations and awards for his work, both as a solo artist and as part of a group. His 2001 release E Apo Mai received multiple N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards (Hawaii\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae), including Male Vocalist of the Year and Hawaiian Album of the Year. He also received Song of the Year honors at the Hawai\u2019i Music Awards for the album\u2019s title track.\n\n2005 saw Aweau again honored with multiple awards, as both a solo artist and as part of the group Hapa. His passion for the electric bass was expressed in his Bass Etude CD, which was voted Jazz Album of the Year. And Hapa\u2019s Maui CD, which shot up Billboard\u2019s World Music chart (peaking at number 7), received awards for Album of the Year, Contemporary Album of the Year, Graphics, and Engineering. Aweau was also honored with his second award for Male Vocalist of the Year for his album The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series - Vintage.\n\nIn 2006 Aweau received his third Male Vocalist of the Year award, for his The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series \u2013 Hula CD. In the 39 year history of the N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards, he remains the only artist to receive the honor three times.\n\nIn 2008 Aweau released \u201cKane\u2019ohe\u201d - the long-awaited follow up to \u201cE Apo Mai\u201d \u2013 which was comprised of songs that celebrate the place that he calls home. He wrote all twelve songs, played every instrument, sang all the background parts, and engineered, mixed, and mastered the entire CD.\n\nHis December 2015 release \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is yet another all-original album, filled with songs inspired by his beloved Hawai\u2019i, his first grandchild, Queen Lili\u2019uokalani, and more.

The record borrows its title from Koch\u2019s poetry zines: Safe Sins is a place of safety, acceptance, and progress. It is a record about isolation, loss, and dismantling shame and grief through self-analysis.\n\nKoch, formerly of beloved Philly trio Cayetana, has been working on the 10 songs that comprise Safe Sins for years. They existed first as poems before being brought to life at The Bunk in Henryville, Pennsylvania, where Koch (guitar, vocals) recorded with bandmates Matt Schimelfenig (guitar, bass, keyboard, vocals), Ian Farmer (bass), and Pat Conaboy (drums). Schimelfenig also produced and mixed the record.\n\nKoch explains that while Safe Sins tracks a narrative arc, it\u2019s not exactly linear\u2014it\u2019s complex and tangled, treading a more realistic path to healing. \u201cTo me, it has this vibe of the stages that you go through when you\u2019re grieving, but also how most people don\u2019t go through one stage then onto the next one,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have it over and over. Even in one day, you could experience all of those things and come up with some type of closure, then the next day feel differently. There\u2019s not really ever a clean conclusion.\u201d\nThe record\u2019s opener gives way to a rush of guitars and both digital and analog drums on the spritely \u201cWhen You Leave The Sun,\u201d a strut in crisp morning sunlight: \u201cOn the bright days, I can see the light/When the chemicals blend just right,\u201d Koch calls brightly. It\u2019s followed by lead single \u201cA Pace Far Different,\u201d a guitar-forward bop haunted by chiming keys and pleas for escape. Scattered throughout, between wiry guitar melodies, drum triggers, and cavernous synth patches, are small, insistent mantras: \u201cWe give \u2018em credit, we don\u2019t owe \u2018em that much,\u201d on \u201cEven At Your Easel,\u201d or the soothing nihilism of \u201cCosmic Joke,\u201d as Koch declares, \u201cEverything I lost, I never really had.\u201dThe record builds to a close with \u201cParlor\u201d and \u201cChoose,\u201d the first of which opens with light organ and drums, and finds Koch inventorying then stitching up the damage done by putting herself behind others: \u201cI\u2019ll gift myself my own respect/Maybe someday time will intercept, and I\u2019ll be able to grant my own success/To be happy.\u201d It\u2019s followed by the clean-slate of \u201cChoose,\u201d which reframes power and self-determination over a slow-march of guitars. \u201cNow I live in absence of or inside my least desirable traits/I pick and choose,\u201d Koch sings before resolving, \u201cI could wield this magic for good/Make it right, I know I could/If I choose.\u201d\n\nSafe Sins is defined equally by pain and hope, two opposing forces that define human existence. The record acknowledges that on some days, the former wins; on the good ones, the latter does. But neither are static endpoints. Both are places we visit often.

His grandparents played a variety of instruments; his mother played piano; and his father taught music and was a choir director. In addition to possessing a natural ability to sing, Aweau\u2019s early years consisted of piano, guitar, and \u2018ukulele lessons, followed by saxophone, percussion, and bass.\n\nHe began his professional career in college, accompanying such well-known performers as Gabe Baltazar, Henry Kapono, Loyal Garner, and Nohelani Cypriano, followed by stints as a member of the award-winning groups Ka`eo (1984-1988), The Ali\u2019i\u2019s (1989-1994), and Hapa (2003-2010). He was also the musical director for the legendary Don Ho for 16 years, and has worked with national artists such as Jerry Brown (drummer for Lionel Richie and Stanley Clarke), and Ron Lee (drummer for Barry Manilow).\n\nAweau also taught music at high school and college seminars, covering subjects ranging from writing, arranging, and sequencing to computer music. In one project he gave Hawai\u2019i high school students the chance to experience the process of producing and recording a song.\n\nIn addition to being a stage musician, Aweau has played for a variety of commercials and provided background music for a number of shows on the Travel Channel. A seasoned music producer, he has worked extensively in the studio producing, arranging, and performing for various large projects, commercials, radio stations, and other artists.\n\nBeloved by fans, Aweau is a natural storyteller with a somewhat self-deprecating sense of humor. His audiences love his explanations of the inspiration behind his songs. He is also highly respected by fellow musicians. The late John Koko, long-time member of the highly popular, multiple-award winning Hawaiian music group The Makaha Sons, once said, \u201cNathan Aweau ... Incredible Bass Player \u2026 Irresistible Voice... Incomparable Entertainer! The CD \u2018Kane`ohe\u2019 will take you on a musical journey that is Haunting...Refreshing... Powerful and Exciting.\u201d\n\nThe respect of other professionals in the music industry is also evidenced by the fact that Aweau has received numerous nominations and awards for his work, both as a solo artist and as part of a group. His 2001 release E Apo Mai received multiple N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards (Hawaii\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae), including Male Vocalist of the Year and Hawaiian Album of the Year. He also received Song of the Year honors at the Hawai\u2019i Music Awards for the album\u2019s title track.\n\n2005 saw Aweau again honored with multiple awards, as both a solo artist and as part of the group Hapa. His passion for the electric bass was expressed in his Bass Etude CD, which was voted Jazz Album of the Year. And Hapa\u2019s Maui CD, which shot up Billboard\u2019s World Music chart (peaking at number 7), received awards for Album of the Year, Contemporary Album of the Year, Graphics, and Engineering. Aweau was also honored with his second award for Male Vocalist of the Year for his album The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series - Vintage.\n\nIn 2006 Aweau received his third Male Vocalist of the Year award, for his The Hawai\u2019i Classic Series \u2013 Hula CD. In the 39 year history of the N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards, he remains the only artist to receive the honor three times.\n\nIn 2008 Aweau released \u201cKane\u2019ohe\u201d - the long-awaited follow up to \u201cE Apo Mai\u201d \u2013 which was comprised of songs that celebrate the place that he calls home. He wrote all twelve songs, played every instrument, sang all the background parts, and engineered, mixed, and mastered the entire CD.\n\nHis December 2015 release \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is yet another all-original album, filled with songs inspired by his beloved Hawai\u2019i, his first grandchild, Queen Lili\u2019uokalani, and more. As was the case for his other solo releases, \u2018\u0100ina H\u0101nau is 100% Aweau. He sang all the vocals (including background); played all the instruments; wrote and arranged all the songs; and recorded, mixed, and mastered the album, all at his In My Bathroom Studios.", "otherInfo": "Masters of Hawaiian Music: George Kahumoku Jr., Nathan Aweau, & Jeff Peterson"}, {"Address": "19 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941", "Artist": "Thunderstorm Artis", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.54802, 37.906982], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sweetwater Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Two stellar artists co-headline this upbeat evening."}, {"Address": "453 Cortland ave, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Rock", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6643774.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.416775, 37.739269], "Date": "Thu Mar 26 2020", "EventDate": "2020-03-26", "Genre": "Rap, Hip Hop, Hip-hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Lucky Horseshoe", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Rock and Blues Jam with Ed Ivey This classic blues & funk jam session is a popular mid-week event featuring great local blues players.
