Originally from West Marin County, he made his way down the California coast through Santa Cruz, writing songs, jamming in garages and performing at every open mic he could find while simultaneously earning a BA in Film & Digital Media and Literature from the University of California Santa Cruz.\n\nHe then immediately moved to Los Angeles where he wrote and arranged his acoustic-laced debut studio album, Californicana. The album was produced by LA producer Marc Danzeisen (Riverdogs, Powerslide, Gilby Clarke), and features saxophonist Jeremy Trezona (Saint Motel), as well as guitarists Johnny Hawthorn (Toad The Wet Sprocket, Everclear) and Manny Alvarez (Jackson Browne, Lucinda Williams), among others. It released independently under Bourne\u2019s own Robotic Records with a successful sold out record release show at the historic (and now permanently closed) House of Blues on the Sunset Strip Foundation Room, followed by a 15-date California Tour.\n\nOn his 2015 debut, Frankie took a stance as a solo artist and emerged on the scene equipped with infectious roots-rock songs, and an authentic indie sound that, \"combines the style of new Americana with all the things you loved about 90s adult alternative bands\" (TourWorthy.com), and \"a smoky, quick-tongued lyrical quality that can change speeds like a Zack Greinke change-up\" (San Jose Rock Music Examiner). His first solo effort has been incredibly well-received by Indie, Rock and Americana radio stations nationwide, and won an award for best love song on the Jango Radio 2015 Valentine's Day Playlist, who call it, \"a refreshing roots rock record for the 21st Century\".\n\nAfter a hard-fought six years in the Los Angeles music scene, Frankie returned to his native San Francisco Bay Area in 2016, where his new band has quickly begun to make a name for themselves in the North Bay for their explosive, jam-oriented live shows, and their melodic roots-rock music that bridges eras of influence. Featuring drummer Jeff Nassi (Meredith Brooks, Fillmore Slim, Unauthorized Rolling Stones), guitarist Sunil Sharma (Alison Harris, Reality Check, Blusion), and bassist Matt Pasquale (Gravity Hill), Bourne\u2019s new band is his primary focus of late. They enter Prairie Sun Studios in Spring 2018 to cut an album under Robotic Records.\n\nOn February 17th 2017 Frankie released Valley of Vindication, a 5-track EP of songs that showcase a softer, more acoustic direction to his sound. On Record Store Day 2017 (April 22nd 2017) Frankie released another 3-track EP, titled Homemade Remedies.\n\nYou can find his music on iTunes, Spotify, Amazon and CD Baby, and hear it on the following terrestrial and internet radio stations: KSVY (Sonoma), KWMR (Marin), KRSH (Santa Rosa), KALW (San Francisco), KPIG & KZSC (Santa Cruz), KCBX (Central Coast), HFM LA (Los Angeles), KHLV (Las Vegas), KHTP (Phoenix), Jango Radio, Indie Radio Music, Relax Free Radio, The Mad Music Asylum, War Stories Radio, and UK based XRP Radio, among others.\n\nwww.frankiebourne.com\n\n\u201cTroubadour Frankie Bourne is one to watch as a burgeoning solo act.

Digitally fueled isolation may be a theme, but this virtuosic acoustic quintet offers its warmest, most emotive and elegantly melodic work to date\u2014so invitingly human in its approach that it practically ushers the listener into the room as these guys assemble in front of a mic.\n\nIndeed, a longing for community and connection was both impetus and inspiration for this disc. Never a group that could be accused of taking it easy, Punch Brothers had been touring almost non-stop since the majority of them first got together to support mandolin player Chris Thile\u2019s 2006 solo album, How to Grow a Woman From the Ground. (And whenever they did take a break from their official Punch Brothers duties, the individual members engaged in a staggering array of solo and collaborative projects with fellow travelers in the worlds of bluegrass, jazz, and classical music.) But in February 2013, after supporting the 2012 disc Who\u2019s Feeling Young Now?\u2014an album in which, a New York Times reviewer opined, the band \u201cshifted the emphasis from instrumental wizardry to playful storytelling\u201d \u2014Punch Bothers decided to scale back the concert schedule allowing themselves the chance to interact musically and personally, away from tour buses and dressing rooms.\n\nAs guitarist Chris Eldridge explains, \u201cThere was a sense among all of us that we needed to dial it back a little bit and really give ourselves time to write a record where we didn\u2019t have deadlines and weren\u2019t under pressure to get something out. So we scheduled these writing retreats. The first was in May 2013. We got together for a week in Charleston, South Carolina. We rented a house, and we played a gig\u2014and the gig paid for us to rent the place. We worked on music all day at a steady pace, but it didn\u2019t feel as pressured as it had in the past. We had another one in Telluride, another one in New York. We had about five of them. It was really good for us to have the space to work on something. We could let a song sit for a day or two and then come back to it and ask, does it still feel great\u2014or not? We never had that luxury before.\u201d\n\nOne such retreat took place at Oberlin College, where the band had been invited to participate as artists in residence at its famed conservatory. They conducted master classes, talked and jammed with students, and played in the auditorium. Banjo player Noam Pikelny recalls, \u201cWe had our own room in the conservatory building, surrounded by all these students who are there working their asses off on their instruments and their compositions. To have the opportunity to work on our own stuff while being surrounded by all of that was very inspiring. We were in an environment where we felt a responsibility to make something very special because part of our audience was right outside our door.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the writing sessions, Thile relates, they had animated debates with each other and with the students, about how they relate to music, and to each other, through a digital filter. A narrative began to emerge that informs compositions like the rueful \u201cI Blew It Off\u201d and the ambitious, three-part opener, \u201cFamiliarity\u201d which goes from spare and staccato to lilting and pastoral. No diatribes here: the words are often haunting and impressionistic, while the music boasts its own powerful eloquence.\n\n\u201cWe started writing these songs,\u201d notes violinist Gabe Witcher, \u201cand had enough time to discover what they really are. And as we saw this story emerge, this narrative, we wanted to see if we could also tell the story sonically. \u2018Familiarity,\u2019 the trilogy, is probably the best example of that. It begins very dry, presented very plainly, no effects, as if these are thoughts coming from inside someone\u2019s head. But, as this thing progresses, the craziness of the outside world envelopes the narrator, tries to get into his consciousness. It builds to a climax and then releases into this dream world. He\u2019s not sure where he is\u2014at a club, a church\u2014or what he is hearing. The presentation of that is very dreamlike, otherworldly. The third piece is the morning after, if you will, presented very organically, as if we are just sitting around in a room playing a song. It\u2019s like Sunday morning waking up\u2014what happened last night? Reckoning with the reality of it all. Trying to enhance those themes sonically\u2014that was another step forward for us in the story telling on the record. We touched on that in Who\u2019s Feeling Young Now? as far as using the studio to enhance the music. Now we are really using the studio to help the narrative along.\u201d\n\nThe Phosphorescent Blues is, in many ways, a slice of modern life, says Thile: \u201cGoing out after shows, we\u2019d go to bars that were loud, where the music may not be ideal, to be around other people, to get a sense of the world for a second. And I\u2019d see people just like me on their phones, telling people they wish they were there, texting people who really are there. Then some song would come on in real time and some person knows that song and then they see that someone else does too and maybe they both sing it together and that moment is spiritual, some shared experience, and they are interacting in three dimensions, in the flesh, with their fellow man. And that\u2019s communion. \u2018Familiarity\u2019 and other songs on this record dive into that: how do we cultivate beautiful, three-dimensional experiences with our fellow man in this day and age?\u201d\n\nShortly before the sessions began, Thile and Witcher met with Burnett and discovered the producer had the very same things on his mind. In fact, he\u2019d just given a commencement address at the University of Southern California on the subject of technology and human interaction. Witcher remembers, \u201cThile and I looked at each and said, \u2018This is unbelievable. It\u2019s exactly what we are writing about.\u2019 So this was a perfect, serendipitous union.\u201d\n\nThat union was also a long time coming. Burnett had previously enlisted Punch Brothers to contribute music to the Hunger Games soundtrack he produced. They performed an even greater role on the soundtrack to the Coen Brothers\u2019 Inside Llewyn Davis, and served as the \u201chouse band\u201d for the star-studded Another Day, Another Time concert Burnett organized at NYC\u2019s Town Hall in September 2013. Having Burnett at the helm of these Punch Brothers sessions was a revelatory experience, even for musicians already so finely attuned to each other.\n\n\u201cT Bone understood what we were trying to do and helped us get it even further,\u201d says bassist Paul Kowert. \u201cHe was like a coach and a teammate at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven as much as we had worked with him before, I had no idea what to expect,\u201d Thile admits. \u201cT Bone works in mysterious ways. His genius is he manages to maintain perspective while being fully and utterly engaged and swept up in the excitement and frustration and hope and despair that goes along with trying to coax life out of these assemblages of notes.\u201d In this setting, Thile delivered what are arguably the most expressive vocals of his career, on songs like \u201cJulep\u201d and \u201cForgotten,\u201d bolstered by harmonies that the Beach Boys\u2019 Brian Wilson would approve of. \u201cSinging while T Bone was in the control room, I felt what it was like for an actor to work with a great director. He would find ways to get me into my own lyrics. He might come at things with some observation about the lyric that would allow me to sing it not just as me but as a whole lot of people.\u201d\n\nBurnett himself added a discreet amount of electric guitar, most noticeably on \u201cI Blew It Off,\u201d and even convinced the band to add percussion on some tracks, a first for a Punch Brothers disc\u2014integrated so artfully into the mix by drummer Jay Bellerose that one has to listen twice to even know it\u2019s there. On \u201cForgotten\u201d and \u201cMy Oh My,\u201d Witcher could overdub himself into an entire string section.\n\nThile brought in the Passepied from Claude Debussy's Suite Bergamasque and they built it into an evocative full-band arrangement. Conversely, \u201cMagnet\u201d jettisons the cerebral for joyful reveling in the carnal; its spirited, syncopated groove mirrors the urgency and anticipatory excitement of a looming, late-night assignation.\n\nFinal track \u201cLittle Lights\u201d sums up The Phosphorescent Blues, a single-take recording that imagines countless smart phones held in the air as a symbol of hope and possibility, a 21st century twist on \u201cThis Little Light Of Mine.\u201d At its climax, the band is actually joined by a digital choir of its fans. The band had tried overdubbing their own voices, but that sounded contrived. Then one night, while driving home in L.A., Witcher had a brainstorm: If they didn\u2019t have the resources to assemble a choir in the studio, why not reach out directly to fans, via Twitter and their website, to add their voices? Eldridge reveals, \u201cWe received over a thousand submissions. It wasn\u2019t about people singing well or badly; we just wanted everyone in there.\u201d\n\n\"Little Lights\" becomes a fitting, and genuinely uplifting, conclusion to The Phosphorescent Blues, as Punch Brothers address the questions they've posed about technology by conjuring up, in the course of the song, a very real virtual community. They used all the digital tools they had on hand, but it ultimately came together in a more familiar way, via words and music and voices.\n\n\u2014Michael Hill", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero W, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Rick Estrin & The Nightcats", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9248229.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Mon Oct 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-07", "Genre": "Genres: Spanning the gamut", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "Larger-than-life blues star Rick Estrin has piloted the wildly fun and musically fearless Rick Estrin & The Nightcats for the last decade, touring the world and proving night after night why they won 2018\u2019s Blues Music Award for Band Of The Year. The limitless combined talents of blues harmonica virtuoso and sly, soulful singer Estrin, guitar mastermind Kid Andersen, keyboard wizard Lorenzo Farrell and endlessly creative drummer Derrick \u201cD\u2019Mar\u201d Martin take Estrin\u2019s inventive, original songs to new and unexpected places. On stage, the band\u2019s ability to deliver an unpredictable, no-holds-barred show is unmatched.\n\nNow, Rick Estrin & The Nightcats return with their fourth studio album, Contemporary. With the band kicking everything up a notch, Estrin and the Nightcats explore some different sounds, instrumentation and grooves, while maintaining the trademark Nightcats style. Produced by Andersen and Estrin and recorded at Andersen\u2019s now-famous Greaseland Studio in San Jose, California, Contemporary delivers twelve surprising, wise-cracking, foot-stomping songs, including nine by Estrin (one co-written with Andersen), one each by Andersen and Farrell, and one obscure Bobo Jenkins cover. From the noir-ish romp I\u2019m Running to the hilarious title track to the sardonic Resentment File (co-written with Estrin\u2019s friend of over 50 years, Joe Louis Walker), Contemporary packs a modern blues punch. According to Estrin, \u201cRecording at Greaseland, we all had so much fun and were so relaxed, the genius ideas just started pouring in from all sides. I really expect this record to blow some minds.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Estrin\u2019s celebrated songwriting and spectacular harmonica playing, he and the band are among the most entertaining and colorful showmen around. Estrin\u2019s flashing harmonica solos, quick wit and signature hipster-cool look, Andersen\u2019s off-the-cuff guitar pyrotechnics, Farrell\u2019s mighty organ and piano work and D\u2019Mar\u2019s dynamic drumming bring instant fun to their live performances. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go out to see people who look like themselves,\u201d says Estrin. \u201cThey want to see something special. I was schooled in this business to be a showman, and that\u2019s what you get when you come to see us perform. We know how to put on a show. I feel sorry for anyone who has to follow us.\u201d\n\nEstrin was schooled by some of the very best blues musicians. While still a teen, he was tutored by San Francisco\u2019s famous musician (and pimp) Fillmore Slim. He was mentored by Oakland\u2019s legendary Rodger Collins, and gigged with blues stars Lowell Fulson and Z.Z. Hill. Estrin moved to Chicago when he was 19 to work with Windy City bluesmen Johnny Young, Eddie Taylor, Sam Lay and John Littlejohn, and even jammed with Muddy Waters. He returned to California and continued to hone his craft. By the time he joined forces with guitarist Little Charlie Baty and formed Little Charlie & The Nightcats in 1976\u2014a band he would front for the next 30 years\u2014Estrin was a seasoned performer with plenty of talent and a newfound knack for writing killer original songs.\n\nUpon Baty\u2019s retirement from touring in 2008, Estrin recruited high-flying guitar wunderkind Christoffer \u201cKid\u201d Andersen and formed Rick Estrin & The Nightcats. The band quickly became a worldwide favorite with blues fans as well as critics and radio programmers. \u201cKid\u2019s a fearless nut on the guitar,\u201d says Estrin. \u201cHe\u2019s really the only guy who could fit in with us.\u201d With an uninhibited style that perfectly meshed with Estrin\u2019s wildly imaginative songs, the new band charged out of the gate. Billboard called them \u201cfabulous, remarkable and original.\u201d\n\nSince the 2009 release of Rick Estrin & The Nightcats\u2019 celebrated Alligator Records debut, Twisted, the 2012 follow-up One Wrong Turn, 2014\u2019s crowd-pleasing You Asked For It...Live!, and 2017\u2019s Groovin\u2019 In Greaseland, the band has toured the world, earning high praise and standing ovations everywhere they go. The Chicago Sun-Times said, \u201cThese are serious musicians having a hotter than hot good time. It\u2019s tough to stay in your seat when Estrin and his musical cohorts get cooking.\u201d They\u2019ve performed at festivals and concert stages from San Francisco to Chicago to New York, and everywhere in between, plus tours of the United Kingdom, Norway, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Poland, Australia, Israel and recently Estonia and Russia. The band\u2019s worldwide popularity helped Estrin win five Blues Music Awards, including two nods for Song Of The Year (1994 and 2018), Best Instrumentalist\u2014Harmonica (2013) and Traditional Blues Male Artist Of The Year (2018). The full band, Rick Estrin & The Nightcats, won the highly coveted 2018 Blues Music Award for Band Of The Year.\n\nAccording to Estrin, \u201cContemporary is the most fully realized expression of who Rick Estrin & The Nightcats really are and what we\u2019re capable of as a band. With the group\u2019s help, everything I envisioned for the songs got turned up a notch, with everyone getting more and more inspired.\u201d This is modern blues at its most potent and powerful, with phenomenal musicianship and lyrics that cut with a wink and nod. According to the UK\u2019s Blues & Rhythm, \u201cRick Estrin & The Nightcats have crafted an instantly identifiable sound. They serve up insightful, original blues combined with tough rock\u2019n\u2019 roll. This band is superb.\u201d\n\nRick Estrin (harmonica, vocals)\nRick Estrin was born in San Francisco, California in 1949, and grew up fiercely independent. As a 10-year-old boy, he made his way to the tough Market Street area and befriended many of the neighborhood characters. When he was 12, his older sister gave him a copy of Ray Charles\u2019 The Genius Sings The Blues, and he became infatuated with the music. Albums from Jimmy Reed, Champion Jack Dupree, Mose Allison, Nina Simone and others soon followed. By the time he was a teenager, Estrin had immersed himself in the urban, African-American culture surrounding him. He got his first harmonica at age 15, and by age 18 was proficient enough to begin sitting in at black clubs around the city. He first jammed with blues master Lowell Fulson and immediately was hired to open five shows for R&B giant Z.Z. Hill. He worked five nights a week for almost a year with guitar legend Travis Phillips in a band fronted by famed pimp/bluesman Fillmore Slim (who was the centerpiece of the acclaimed Hughes Brothers documentary American Pimp). Slim introduced Estrin to singer Rodger Collins, the man who would become Rick\u2019s first real musical mentor. Collins schooled Rick on the finer points of songwriting and show business. At 19, Estrin relocated to Chicago and worked with some of the city\u2019s best bluesmen. He met and jammed with the legendary Muddy Waters, who told Rick, \u201cYou outta sight, boy! You got that sound! You play like a man!\u201d Muddy wanted Estrin to go on the road with him, but Estrin missed Muddy\u2019s phone call and it never happened. Estrin eventually moved back to the Bay Area, met guitarist Charlie Baty and formed Little Charlie & The Nightcats. With Charlie\u2019s retirement from touring in 2008, Rick brought in guitar virtuoso Kid Andersen and formed Rick Estrin & The Nightcats.\n\nEstrin cites Sonny Boy Williamson II, Percy Mayfield and Detroit bluesman Baby Boy Warren as his major songwriting influences. His work on the reeds is deep in the tradition of harmonica masters Sonny Boy Williamson II and Little Walter Jacobs, while at the same time pushing that tradition forward with his innovative songs. And his sly and soulful vocals are the perfect vehicle for driving those songs home.\n\nKid Andersen (guitar)\nChristoffer \u201cKid\u201d Andersen was born in Telemark, Norway. A blues fan since childhood, Andersen fell in love with the music of Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, Junior Watson, and the Kings (B.B., Albert and Freddie). By the time he was 18, he was backing all the American blues stars who came through Norway, including Homesick James, Nappy Brown and Willie \u201cBig Eyes\u201d Smith. He moved to California when he was 21. Once in the U.S.A., Andersen earned a green card as an \u201cAlien of Extraordinary Ability.\u201d Andersen released four solo albums before joining blues harmonica legend Charlie Musselwhite\u2019s band in 2004, a gig that lasted until he joined Rick Estrin & The Nightcats in 2008. In addition to being an expert multi-instrumentalist (guitar, bass, keyboards, percussion), Kid\u2019s talents as engineer and producer keep his now-famous Greaseland Studio fully booked. Winner of the 2017 Keeping The Blues Alive Award, Greaseland has been featured in The San Jose Mercury News as well as on NPR. At Greaseland, Kid has produced, engineered (and many times played on) albums by artists including Tommy Castro, Nick Moss, John Nemeth, Wee Willie Walker and Finis Tasby, as well as all five Rick Estrin & The Nightcats CDs.\n\nLorenzo Farrell (piano, organ)\nLorenzo Farrell was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and grew up in Bloomington, Indiana, where he started playing piano at age five. During his high school years in California, he discovered jazz and made the switch to upright acoustic bass. After high school, Farrell took several years off from his music career to earn a degree in Philosophy from the University of California at Berkeley, and study religion in Delhi, India. Since returning to the San Francisco Bay Area, he has been a highly sought-after multi-instrumentalist, having returned to piano and mastered the organ in recent years. A Nightcat since 2003, Lorenzo has also had the opportunity to perform and/or record with many other artists, including Wee Willie Walker, Elvin Bishop, Finis Tasby, Jackie Payne, Andy Santana, Terry Hanck and Little Charlie Baty\u2019s Organ Grinder Swing.\n\nDerrick \u201cD\u2019Mar\u201d Martin (drums)\nDerrick \u201cD\u2019Mar\u201d Martin is simply a force of nature.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "1232 Grant ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "GG Amos", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9361417.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.406986, 37.798566], "Date": "Tue Oct 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-08", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, West Coast Blues, Soul Jazz, R&B", "Time": "4:30 PM", "Venue": "The Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "Guitarist / Vocalist GG Amos is an artist in the West Coast Blues tradition.

The founding members were schoolmates David Hinds (the primary songwriter as well as the lead singer and guitarist), Basil Gabbidon (guitar), and Ronnie \"Stepper\" McQueen (bass). All of them came from working class West Indian immigrant families, and none had much musical experience. They took some time to improve their technical proficiency, often on Roots inspired material by the Wailers, Burning Spear and several other prominent Jamaican artists. McQueen suggested the group name, after a racehorse, and they soon fleshed out the lineup with drummer Steve \"Grizzly\" Nisbett, keyboardist/vocalist Selwyn \"Bumbo\" Brown, percussionist/vocalist Alphonso \"Fonso\" Martin, and vocalist Michael Riley.\n\nSteel Pulse initially had difficulty finding live gigs, as club owners were reluctant to give them a platform for their \"subversive\" Rastafarian politics. Luckily, the punk movement was opening up new avenues for music all over Britain, and also finding a spiritual kinship with protest reggae. Thus, the group wound up as an opening act for punk and new wave bands like the Clash, the Stranglers, Generation X, the Police, and XTC, and built a broad-based audience in the process. In keeping with the spirit of the times, Steel Pulse developed a theatrical stage show that leavened their social commentary with satirical humor; many of the members dressed in costumes that mocked traditional British archetypes (Riley was a vicar, McQueen a bowler-wearing aristocrat, Martin a coach footman, etc.). The band issued two singles -- \"Kibudu, Mansetta and Abuku\" and \"Nyah Love\" -- on small independent labels, when they then came to the attention of Island Records after opening for Burning Spear.\n\nSteel Pulse's first single for Island was the classic \"Ku Klux Klan,\" which happened to lend itself well to the band's highly visual, costume-heavy concerts. It appeared on their 1978 debut album, Handsworth Revolution, which was soon hailed as a classic of British reggae by many fans and critics, thanks to songs like the title track, \"Macka Splaff,\" \"Prodigal Son,\" and \"Soldiers.\" Riley departed before the follow-up, 1979's Tribute to the Martyrs, which featured other key early singles in \"Sound System\" and \"Babylon Makes the Rules,\" and solidified the band's reputation for uncompromising political ferocity. That reputation went out the window on 1980's Caught You, a more pop-oriented set devoted to dance tracks and lovers rock. By that point, Steel Pulse was keen on trying to crack the American market, and went on tour over Island's objections. Caught You was issued in the States as Reggae Fever, but failed to break the group, and they soon parted ways with Island.\n\nSteel Pulse moved on to Elektra/Asylum, which released an LP version of their headlining set at the 1981 Reggae Sunsplash Festival. Their studio debut was 1982's True Democracy, a generally acclaimed set that balanced bright, accessible production with a return to social consciousness. It became their first charting LP in America, making both the pop and R&B listings. The slicker follow-up, Earth Crisis, was released in 1984 and featured producer Jimmy \"Senyah\" Haynes subbing on guitar and bass for founding members Gabbidon and McQueen, both of whom left the group by the end of the recording sessions. They were replaced by guitarist Carlton Bryan and bassist Alvin Ewen for 1986's Babylon the Bandit, another Haynes-produced effort that ranked as the group's most polished, synth-centered record to date. It featured the powerful \"Not King James Version\" and won a Grammy for Best Reggae Album.\n\nIn 1988, Steel Pulse released State of Emergency, their most explicitly crossover-oriented album yet. They also contributed the track \"Can't Stand It\" to the soundtrack of Spike Lee's classic Do the Right Thing. In 1991, they released another heavily commercial album, the Grammy-nominated Victims, which featured the single \"Taxi Driver.\" Backing up the song's views, Steel Pulse filed a class-action lawsuit against the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, charging that drivers discriminated against blacks and particularly Rastafarians. Founding member Fonso Martin left that year, reducing Steel Pulse to a core trio of Hinds, Nisbett, and Brown. Their backing band still featured Ewen and was elsewhere anchored by guitarist Clifford \"Moonie\" Pusey, keyboardist Sidney Mills, trumpeter Kevin Batchelor, Saxophonist Jerry Johnson and Trombonist Clark Gayton.\n\nThe 1992 live album Rastafari Centennial marked the beginning of a return to the group's musical roots, and earned another Grammy nomination. The following year, they performed at Bill Clinton's inaugural celebration, the first reggae band to appear at such an event. 1994's studio album Vex completed Steel Pulse's re-embrace of classic roots reggae, though it also nodded to contemporary dancehall with several guest toasters and a digital-flavored production. 1997's Rage and Fury continued in a similar vein, and was nominated for a Grammy. In 1999, the group released another collection of live performances, Living Legacy.\n\nFast forward a long seven years since their previous album, Rage and Fury, Steel Pulse would return yet again, this time with African Holocaust, and yet again have their ranks dwindled. Core members David Hinds (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Selwyn Brown (keyboards, backing vocals) are the only ones to remain from the band's original line-up, but they more than hold their own and they're joined by a deep roster of supporting musicians, a list too long to list. As always, the music is what's most important, and on that count, this Steel Pulse lineup indeed makes the mark. Granted, it did take them seven years to get the album out, but still it won a Grammy Awards Nomination for Best Reggae Album of the year. There's really not too much else to say about African Holocaust. Longtime fans will know what to expect. Newcomers should know a few things: above all, Steel Pulse are known for performing well-written, Afrocentric songs that are rebellious without being negative or inflammatory, and though the band membership has changed over the years, the type of songs hasn't, nor has the steady move away from dancehall that was apparent on the band's previous album. the message and music remain true to the band's principles and vision.\n\nSteel Pulse is one of Britain's greatest reggae bands, in terms of creative and commercial success. Steel Pulse started out playing authentic roots reggae with touches of jazz and Latin music, and earned a substantial audience worldwide. Their 1978 debut, Handsworth Revolution, is still regarded by many critics as a landmark and a high point of British reggae. By the late '80s, Steel Pulse had won a Grammy and were working full-fledged crossover territory. They subsequently returned to a tough-minded, rootsy sound and have added touches of dancehall and hip-hop along the way.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "100 El Camino Real, Menlo Park, CA 94025", "Artist": "Chenot", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8140997.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.172094, 37.447768], "Date": "Tue Oct 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-08", "Genre": "Genres: Classic Rock, Motown, Pop", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Menlo Tavern @ Stanford Park Hotel", "moreBioInfo": "I play and sing whatever eclectic covers strike my fancy, from classic rock to Motown to that 90s jam you forgot you loved.
