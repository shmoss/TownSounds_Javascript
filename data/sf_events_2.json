Meltdown: the flailing emotional implosion often borne of a triumvirate of frayed nerves, volatile substances and excessive external pressure is clearly evidenced in the words and music herein. But, there's also a newfound sense of musical genres and histories mixing together like molten wax where the band's signature Shangri-La's, Bad Seeds, noir-hued pop merges with hazy psychedelia, bombastic rock and even essences of bizarre Eastern European folk. It's the sound of a band that's always been at the brink of self-destruction actually growing and thriving on its own chaotic impulses. It's now six years into something that wasn\u2019t expected to last six months -- this \u201cthing\u201d called Jail Weddings. While the songs have always been timeless and top notch, they're also a band whose initial popularity often hinged on the fact that it could all fall apart at any given moment -- with frequent dagger eyes or fistfights both onstage and off -- where it was always clear to the audience that the high-drama of the songs often spilled into the band members' own precarious lives. They are a group that audiences could live through vicariously, a band capable of not just inspiring listeners' ugly catharsis, but often enacting its own in public. One of few that could claim they are not just a band, but a lifestyle all their own. It was late 2012 when we had last checked in with frontman Gabriel Hart, who explained that last year\u2019s Four Future Standards EP (described by VICE Magazine as \u201cmusic to have knife sex to\u201d) was also the gradual bridge to their more grandiose work-in-progress second full-length. Hart ensured that anyone who thought they were any sort of \u201cparty band\u201d would be gravely mistaken upon hearing what they had been stirring up in their charred cauldron. Little did he know it would take well over 365 days to finish what he had started, where the stakes were raised, bank accounts drained, sanity/sobriety and sleep compromised, and their longtime rhythm section and one of their back-up singers lost\u2026where towards the end it would cause him and his eight-headed collective to treat it with all the intensity a band would as if it was the last record they would ever record, even though their present locomotive momentum will prove at least that part otherwise. And what better process to make a record, Meltdown \u2013 A Declaration of Unpopular Emotion which Hart describes as a somewhat conceptual \u201cdissection of the personal Apocalypse.\u201d A record whose liner notes cite such patron saints as disparate as philosopher Carl Jung and enfant terrible Francis Farmer as touchstones? But, this is only for the uninitiated to understand \u2013 as within the first listen of Meltdown one will soon realize this record is indeed a vast, universal tantrum, where the best path of protest is often to create one's own atmosphere, to secede from pain through a self-imposed baptism of fire. And, the end inspiration proves once again one must look no further than Jail Weddings' own twisted, snake-eating-its-tail world they\u2019ve created.

Meltdown: the flailing emotional implosion often borne of a triumvirate of frayed nerves, volatile substances and excessive external pressure is clearly evidenced in the words and music herein. But, there's also a newfound sense of musical genres and histories mixing together like molten wax where the band's signature Shangri-La's, Bad Seeds, noir-hued pop merges with hazy psychedelia, bombastic rock and even essences of bizarre Eastern European folk. It's the sound of a band that's always been at the brink of self-destruction actually growing and thriving on its own chaotic impulses. It's now six years into something that wasn\u2019t expected to last six months -- this \u201cthing\u201d called Jail Weddings. While the songs have always been timeless and top notch, they're also a band whose initial popularity often hinged on the fact that it could all fall apart at any given moment -- with frequent dagger eyes or fistfights both onstage and off -- where it was always clear to the audience that the high-drama of the songs often spilled into the band members' own precarious lives. They are a group that audiences could live through vicariously, a band capable of not just inspiring listeners' ugly catharsis, but often enacting its own in public. One of few that could claim they are not just a band, but a lifestyle all their own. It was late 2012 when we had last checked in with frontman Gabriel Hart, who explained that last year\u2019s Four Future Standards EP (described by VICE Magazine as \u201cmusic to have knife sex to\u201d) was also the gradual bridge to their more grandiose work-in-progress second full-length. Hart ensured that anyone who thought they were any sort of \u201cparty band\u201d would be gravely mistaken upon hearing what they had been stirring up in their charred cauldron. Little did he know it would take well over 365 days to finish what he had started, where the stakes were raised, bank accounts drained, sanity/sobriety and sleep compromised, and their longtime rhythm section and one of their back-up singers lost\u2026where towards the end it would cause him and his eight-headed collective to treat it with all the intensity a band would as if it was the last record they would ever record, even though their present locomotive momentum will prove at least that part otherwise. And what better process to make a record, Meltdown \u2013 A Declaration of Unpopular Emotion which Hart describes as a somewhat conceptual \u201cdissection of the personal Apocalypse.\u201d A record whose liner notes cite such patron saints as disparate as philosopher Carl Jung and enfant terrible Francis Farmer as touchstones? But, this is only for the uninitiated to understand \u2013 as within the first listen of Meltdown one will soon realize this record is indeed a vast, universal tantrum, where the best path of protest is often to create one's own atmosphere, to secede from pain through a self-imposed baptism of fire. And, the end inspiration proves once again one must look no further than Jail Weddings' own twisted, snake-eating-its-tail world they\u2019ve created. Meltdown begins somewhat similarly to their 2010 debut Love Is Lawless -- Hart\u2019s lone baritone accompanied by minimal instrumentation slowly building the anticipation that something is about to leave a crater in its wake.

More often it hovers between, ambivalent yet beautifully apprehended by Hana Vu on her debut EP How Many Times Have You Driven By. Written and produced by Hana herself, the EP masters the defining balance of bedroom pop: it\u2019s warm, sparse, and whisper-intimate yet at the same time wholly radio-ready. The opening \u201cCrying on the Subway\u201d, set on the purgatorial Metro Red Line between downtown and the valley, is saturated with a mood of L.A. noir, with Hana singing to her reflection: \u201cIn my dreams I\u2019m in that grey room. In my chest I\u2019m feeling dark blue. Take the Red Line into downtown. I\u2019m trying to escape you.\u201d It was this song\u2014 or rather its accompanying video\u2014 that first tripped the sensors of Chris and Graham of Luminelle Recordings, a recent offshoot of Fat Possum. The precocious Vu, at only seventeen, had already written music for five years, self-released an album on Soundcloud featuring a collab with Willow Smith, and polished up enough new songs for a gem of an EP, which they eagerly signed, pressed, and called in Clay Jones (Modest Mouse, Sunflower Bean) to master.\n\nClamoring for creative outlets from an early age, she formed musical projects and played shows, though without fully clicking with her teen peers in the local D.I.Y. brat-pack. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself a curmudgeon, but I found it hard to be friends with other young people. Instead, I found two or three key homies, then just did my own thing\u2014 socially and in my music\u201d\u2014 partly explaining the ambition and ambiance of How Many Times Have You Driven By. On \u201cCool\u201d, for instance, Hana drapes a lower-key, soulful melody over beats borrowed from her friend Satchy, who also chimes in for a verse as they tarry with life\u2019s misfortunes. She follows this with \u201cShallow\u201d, in which her calm twists into agitation and a more recognizably rock instrumentation, all played and recorded by Hana in her bedroom. The EP returns to peace with the dreamy \u201c426\u201d\u2014 the address of a summer residence in which Hana discovered a sense of place or belonging\u2014 though fleetingly, as her friends disbanded at the season\u2019s end. But, c\u2019est la vie. Solitude, for all its occasional pangs, is for Hana Vu as much a condition of her independence, a little breathing room from the throng to forge her own certain future in music.

His new single \u201cBeautiful Life\u201d is captivating audiences.\n\nWhile many artists spend a lifetime chasing \u201cinternational status,\u201d 24-year-old classically trained singer-songwriter-musician Sebastian Mikael is already starting his career where others can only hope to finish. Born in Sweden to a Swedish father and Ethiopian mother, Sebastian Mikael\u2014formerly known as De-Lor (which is French for \u201cof gold\u201d)\u2014was raised in a diverse household that was enriched by music. While no one in his family ever made music professionally, Sebastian Mikael inherited his passion for music from his father and the sounds he grew up listening to inspired him to find out what was going on behind the music.\n\nWhat started off as a childhood hobby soon snowballed into an adolescent obsession that led to him picking up the guitar and mimicking the sounds he heard on the radio. \u201cI became interested in knowing exactly what the musicians were doing and how they got their sounds,\u201d says Sebastian Mikael, who started off playing his favorite songs by Marvin Gaye, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Wyclef Jean, Akon and Usher.\n\nBefore long, Sebastian Mikael\u2019s newfound passion led him to clocking long hours at Swedish recording studios, singing hooks for rappers and teaming up with a local producer to form a production team. But while the duo\u2019s initial recordings generated a lot of online buzz, Sebastian Mikael was eager to strike out on his own. \u201cI saw the initial potential of the work we were doing,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t getting a shot at doing my own songs. Plus, they are not as open-minded about music in Sweden as they are in the U.S.\u201d\n\nFeeling a glass ceiling approaching in Sweden, Sebastian Mikael set his sights on America and enrolled at California\u2019s Musicians Institute to study audio engineering in 2008. After living in California for two years, he relocated to Boston in 2010 to attend Berklee College of Music. While a student at Berklee, Sebastian was signed by Slip-N-Slide Records CEO Ted Lucas and in late 2011 he released his first mixtape, J\u2019Adore, which received rave reviews from his steadily growing fan base. His breakthrough video single, \u201cBeautiful Life,\u201d in which he sings an inspirational message about appreciating life, captures the essence of Sebastian Mikael\u2019s music as a whole. \u201cMy lyrical content is not always about love, but what we go through and feel in life,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to put hope in my music\u2014stuff that makes you feel good musically and lyrically.\u201d\n\nNow in the studio working on his hotly anticipated forthcoming full-length debut album due out in 2013, Sebastian Mikael has been busy collaborating with some of the finest producers and songwriters in the business, including Jim Jonsin and Rico Love.\n\nWith just a handful of years experience as a musician, Sebastian Mikael is already skilled at meshing elements of rock, R&B, pop and electronic music into one cohesive package, held together by his unique acoustic guitar playing. \u201cI feel like my music truly has something to say,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people hear my music, I want them to relate. The way my music makes me feel inside is usually the same way people feel when they hear it.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8983573.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Tue Oct 1 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-01", "Genre": "Genres: R&B", "OtherInfo": "Mahalia", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall"}, {"Address": "Oakland, CA", "Artist": "Cigarettes After Sex", "ArtistBio": "Cigarettes After Sex front man Greg Gonzalez had a clear vision for his band\u2019s debut album, a gorgeously cinematic work released via Partisan Records on June 9th, 2017. After the phenomenal online break-out success of 2015\u2019s reverberant beauty \u2018Nothing\u2019s Gonna Hurt You Baby\u2019 from the early Cigarettes EP (\u2018I.\u2019) from 2012, the Brooklyn transplant (originally from El Paso) wanted to project his worldview on to a bigger screen, a broader canvas. As Greg explains, \u201cThis is like the novel or feature-length version of Cigarettes. I wanted it to feel like a complete work, where some of the imagery repeats \u2013 like it\u2019s all in the same world. It\u2019s very much a fulfilment of the feelings in the short works.\u201d\n\nThat sense of fulfilment is richly felt on Cigarettes After Sex, which unspools like the most achingly romantic of movies: immersive, cohesive and transporting. Swooning in the spirit of influences such as Mazzy Star and Red House Painters, its sumptuous songs of love elevate Cigarettes to the ranks of those acts who create worlds of their own, exciting the most devoted kind of following \u2013 for Gonzalez, The Smiths were a reference point.\n\nRight from the off, Gonzalez\u2019s ability to set a scene and sustain a mood reels you in deeply. On album opener \u2018K.\u2019, a tale of blossoming love etched in tiny details luxuriates over chiming guitars; on the hymn to romantic compulsion of \u2018Each Time You Fall in Love\u2019, the suspended animation of Angelo Badalamenti\u2019s heart-stopping Twin Peaks music is echoed. \u2018Sunsetz\u2019 and the gently lilting \u2018Sweet\u2019, meanwhile, showcase Gonzalez\u2019s ability to weave impressionistic snapshots of romance into melodies that haunt like memories of past loves, all coalescing around his melting vocals.\n\nElsewhere, Gonzalez mounts movies in miniature with the photographic references of \u2018Flash\u2019 and Fitzcarraldo echoes of \u2018Opera House\u2019, a song so lovingly languid it could, conceivably, soundtrack a man hauling ships over mountains for love. And, just as every good film-maker knows the need for a killer finale, so Gonzalez closes the album with the retro-romantic swing and teasingly filthy put-downs (the \u201csucking cock\u201d lyric isn\u2019t as barbed as it seems, just friendly joshing) of \u2018Young & Dumb\u2019, which brings the album to a close with good, timeless advice: \u201cDrive your car to the beach with the song on repeat\u2026\u201d.\n\nIf the result is the spirit of pop-noir romanticism distilled, it\u2019s also grand pay-off for Gonzalez\u2019s band\u2019s slow-burn gestation. Although Cigarettes seemed to spark into life over one breakthrough weekend in 2015, Gonzalez ignited the project in 2008. Early iterations nodded to 1980s-vintage New Order, Erasure and Madonna, before Gonzalez harkened back to darker influences such as Joy Division for a band makeover. A commitment to confessional, sexualised lyrics stuck early; Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u2018Chelsea Hotel No 2\u2019 numbered among Greg\u2019s reference points.\n\nFor some of the band\u2019s early years, Gonzalez studied music at the University of Texas, El Paso. He dropped out but his time there was not wasted. Attracted by the \u201cecho-y\u201d sonic potential of a university stairway, he recorded an EP there which, he says, \u201cended up being something special\u201d. Indeed, Cigarettes\u2019 2012 EP was so special Gonzalez struggled to follow it. When his patient perfectionism bore fruit with \u2018Affection\u2019, the online response took his breath away, he recalls. \u201cThere was this big flood of support over, like, a weekend\u2026 It was fairly emotional for me, because I\u2019d been waiting for that since I started writing music.\u201d\n\nPost-university, Gonzalez had moved to Brooklyn, where he bided his time working as a musician and managing a cinema, the Beekman Theatre on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. If his memories of holding private screenings with friends there sound romantic, so do his favourite films. The \u201cstrange mystery\u201d and \u201chazy\u201d romance of Antonioni\u2019s L\u2019Avventura was one influence; so was the \u201cautumnal beauty\u201d of Kieslowski\u2019s The Double Life of Veronique.\n\nTo mirror their woozy romanticism in music, Gonzalez rejected conventional studio routes for his band, which numbers Randy Miller on bass, Jacob Tomsky on drums and Tubbs on keyboards. Taking influence from The Cowboy Junkies\u2019 The Trinity Session (recorded in a church, single microphone), Cigarettes recorded most of the album in three days at the Sweatshop rehearsal space, Bushwick. The exception is \u2018Each Time You Fall in Love\u2019, which was recorded in the Beekman\u2019s stairway after hours, the ghosts of screen lovers channelled in every warm note.

Fronted by self-confessed contrarian Phil Labonte, the band has experimented with a range of styles including pop, rock and caustic metalcore with just one objective \u2013 to create great songs that come straight from the heart.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always been to write songs that we like,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cAll That Remains has seen a lot of criticism about the songs that we\u2019ve written and what people think we\u2019re supposed to do. We started as a very underground death metal kind of band, we\u2019ve since moved away from that and have never apologized for it. The music we\u2019ve written has been reflective of that and I think the lyrics, the ideas, have always been reflective of that as well.\u201d\n\nAnd through it all, All That Remains have experienced considerable success. The band\u2019s last album 2015\u2019s The Order of Things reached #3 on the Billboard U.S. Hard Rock Albums chart and #5 on their Top Rock Albums chart. And to date, All That Remains have sold over a million albums Worldwide. The band has headlined across the world and played major festivals, including the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Fest.\n\nYet along the way, All That Remains have taken flak from just about everybody: extreme metal purists who accused the group of selling out, rock fans that don\u2019t get the screamy stuff, liberals who object to Labonte\u2019s right-of-center lyrics and conservatives that can\u2019t understand the singer\u2019s non-violent, Libertarian ways. Labonte\u2019s response \u2013 bring it on!\n\nMadness, All That Remains\u2019 eighth album, is the band\u2019s most musically eclectic, provocative release to date \u2013 full of undeniable hooks, incisive riffs, electronic samples and a variety of vocal styles. And, of course, the range of subject matter addressed pushes the band\u2019s limits further than ever.\n\n\"I don't mind if I piss off if it gets them to think about things. People know that I have strong opinions and I disagree with things. That's my whole deal.\"\n\nAs contrary as he wants to be, Labonte still values quality over confrontation. Madness, produced by Grammy award winning Howard Benson (Halestorm, Papa Roach, Chris Cornell), is All That Remains at their best, offering a level of accessibility and diversity lacking from much of today\u2019s hard rock and metal. The first single and title track, \u201cMadness,\u201d is a microcosm for the rest of the album.\n\nThe song starts on an experimental note with a barrage of amp static and the buzzing of ungrounded electricity accompanied by a sharp, simple drum intro. A pause later, the whole band kicks into gear, blending a propulsive rhythm with a kinetic groove that swings like a rope ladder in a thunderstorm. As the vocals enter, the guitars drop out, replaced by a delicate keyboard melody and electronic beats. Then, after Labonte sings, \u201cWhy should we escape ourselves? We are who we are in the end,\u201d the tone shifts back in a heavier direction, leading to a monster chorus more infectious than influenza.\u201d In true Labonte style, the tune is neither a love song nor a euphoric anthem about rocking out. \u201cIt\u2019s about socialism,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the repetition of bad ideas.\u201d\n\nOther songs on Madness are far more variegated. The leadoff track \u201cSafe House,\u201d which is about a man who lures robbers into his home and then kills them, is the heaviest track All That Remains has written since they played melodic death metal in the first half of the aughts. Driven by barreling beats, thrashy guitars, a crushing breakdown and metalcore screaming, the track pulverizes even as haunting keyboards and clanging percussion offer a brief respite from the jackhammer pounding.\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cFar From Home,\u201d which shifts between ringing acoustic guitars and forlorn vocals about being lost and alone, and a euphoric rock passage that shows that there\u2019s always light in the darkness.\n\nThroughout Madness All That Remains revisits the dichotomy between savagery and sensitivity. \u201cTrust and Believe\u201d contrasts double-bass drums, chugging riffs and melodic guitar licks with soaring guitar melodies and an anthemic chant-along chorus and \u201cHalo\u201d opens with a speedy electronic passage that sounds like a violin on hyper drive, then develops into a blazing number that balances melodic vocals with pain stricken howls.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted this record to be different,\u201d Labonte says,\u201d explaining the inclusion of electronic samples and the dramatic juxtaposition between roaring chaos and accessible craftsmanship. \u201cWe wanted to really push ourselves and push the boundaries of what we\u2019re allowed to do. We\u2019ve always pushed that envelope, but we wanted to push it more.\u201d\n\nAll That Remains started working on Madness in the spring of 2016, then in April Labonte flew from his home in Western Massachusetts to Los Angeles to start working on vocal melodies and lyrics with Benson. It was the first time the band didn\u2019t have fleshed out riffs and fully written rhythms to serve as guideposts for the vocals. At first, the process was difficult and the band members were uncomfortable, but the more they worked on the record the more excited they became about the way the songs were coming out. For the first time in years, they felt genuinely challenged and inspired to learn new ways to create.\n\n\u201cMe, Mike and Oli are the primary writers and we\u2019ve always written songs on guitars because we\u2019re all guitar players,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt was a totally different way to write songs. And I feel like it was really, really cool to do that because it gave us a fresh perspective. I\u2019d bring Mike and Oli the vocals and they\u2019d use what I had come up with to construct the riffs instead of the other way around.\u201d\n\nThe most difficult song for Labonte to create was \u201cRivercity.\u201d The song begins with a ringing telephone and progresses through an electronic beat, a melancholy, ballad-like guitar line and plaintive vocals. The track changes in intensity numerous times and injects various rhythm shifts before ending like it began.

Fronted by self-confessed contrarian Phil Labonte, the band has experimented with a range of styles including pop, rock and caustic metalcore with just one objective \u2013 to create great songs that come straight from the heart.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always been to write songs that we like,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cAll That Remains has seen a lot of criticism about the songs that we\u2019ve written and what people think we\u2019re supposed to do. We started as a very underground death metal kind of band, we\u2019ve since moved away from that and have never apologized for it. The music we\u2019ve written has been reflective of that and I think the lyrics, the ideas, have always been reflective of that as well.\u201d\n\nAnd through it all, All That Remains have experienced considerable success. The band\u2019s last album 2015\u2019s The Order of Things reached #3 on the Billboard U.S. Hard Rock Albums chart and #5 on their Top Rock Albums chart. And to date, All That Remains have sold over a million albums Worldwide. The band has headlined across the world and played major festivals, including the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Fest.\n\nYet along the way, All That Remains have taken flak from just about everybody: extreme metal purists who accused the group of selling out, rock fans that don\u2019t get the screamy stuff, liberals who object to Labonte\u2019s right-of-center lyrics and conservatives that can\u2019t understand the singer\u2019s non-violent, Libertarian ways. Labonte\u2019s response \u2013 bring it on!\n\nMadness, All That Remains\u2019 eighth album, is the band\u2019s most musically eclectic, provocative release to date \u2013 full of undeniable hooks, incisive riffs, electronic samples and a variety of vocal styles. And, of course, the range of subject matter addressed pushes the band\u2019s limits further than ever.\n\n\"I don't mind if I piss off if it gets them to think about things. People know that I have strong opinions and I disagree with things. That's my whole deal.\"\n\nAs contrary as he wants to be, Labonte still values quality over confrontation. Madness, produced by Grammy award winning Howard Benson (Halestorm, Papa Roach, Chris Cornell), is All That Remains at their best, offering a level of accessibility and diversity lacking from much of today\u2019s hard rock and metal. The first single and title track, \u201cMadness,\u201d is a microcosm for the rest of the album.\n\nThe song starts on an experimental note with a barrage of amp static and the buzzing of ungrounded electricity accompanied by a sharp, simple drum intro. A pause later, the whole band kicks into gear, blending a propulsive rhythm with a kinetic groove that swings like a rope ladder in a thunderstorm. As the vocals enter, the guitars drop out, replaced by a delicate keyboard melody and electronic beats. Then, after Labonte sings, \u201cWhy should we escape ourselves? We are who we are in the end,\u201d the tone shifts back in a heavier direction, leading to a monster chorus more infectious than influenza.\u201d In true Labonte style, the tune is neither a love song nor a euphoric anthem about rocking out. \u201cIt\u2019s about socialism,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the repetition of bad ideas.\u201d\n\nOther songs on Madness are far more variegated. The leadoff track \u201cSafe House,\u201d which is about a man who lures robbers into his home and then kills them, is the heaviest track All That Remains has written since they played melodic death metal in the first half of the aughts. Driven by barreling beats, thrashy guitars, a crushing breakdown and metalcore screaming, the track pulverizes even as haunting keyboards and clanging percussion offer a brief respite from the jackhammer pounding.\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cFar From Home,\u201d which shifts between ringing acoustic guitars and forlorn vocals about being lost and alone, and a euphoric rock passage that shows that there\u2019s always light in the darkness.\n\nThroughout Madness All That Remains revisits the dichotomy between savagery and sensitivity. \u201cTrust and Believe\u201d contrasts double-bass drums, chugging riffs and melodic guitar licks with soaring guitar melodies and an anthemic chant-along chorus and \u201cHalo\u201d opens with a speedy electronic passage that sounds like a violin on hyper drive, then develops into a blazing number that balances melodic vocals with pain stricken howls.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted this record to be different,\u201d Labonte says,\u201d explaining the inclusion of electronic samples and the dramatic juxtaposition between roaring chaos and accessible craftsmanship. \u201cWe wanted to really push ourselves and push the boundaries of what we\u2019re allowed to do. We\u2019ve always pushed that envelope, but we wanted to push it more.\u201d\n\nAll That Remains started working on Madness in the spring of 2016, then in April Labonte flew from his home in Western Massachusetts to Los Angeles to start working on vocal melodies and lyrics with Benson. It was the first time the band didn\u2019t have fleshed out riffs and fully written rhythms to serve as guideposts for the vocals. At first, the process was difficult and the band members were uncomfortable, but the more they worked on the record the more excited they became about the way the songs were coming out. For the first time in years, they felt genuinely challenged and inspired to learn new ways to create.\n\n\u201cMe, Mike and Oli are the primary writers and we\u2019ve always written songs on guitars because we\u2019re all guitar players,\u201d Labonte says. \u201cIt was a totally different way to write songs. And I feel like it was really, really cool to do that because it gave us a fresh perspective. I\u2019d bring Mike and Oli the vocals and they\u2019d use what I had come up with to construct the riffs instead of the other way around.\u201d\n\nThe most difficult song for Labonte to create was \u201cRivercity.\u201d The song begins with a ringing telephone and progresses through an electronic beat, a melancholy, ballad-like guitar line and plaintive vocals. The track changes in intensity numerous times and injects various rhythm shifts before ending like it began. When he was working on \u201cRivercity,\u201d Labonte\u2019s then-wife was deployed in the Middle East in the Marines and the singer was left helpless at home while she risked her life on the front lines.\n\nWhile the title \u201cRivercity\u201d sounds like an innocent enough name for a song \u2013 the kind of title John Mellencamp might use about childhood memories -- for Labonte the term was very real and frightening. \u201cRivercity stands for \u2018reduced communications,\u2019 he explains. \u201cMe and my ex would be on the phone and she\u2019d be like, \u201cYo, the base is getting mortared. I gotta go.\u2019 If someone dies, they shut off communications until they can notify the families of the people that die.

Our shared values around working together to elevate our music to levels we couldn\u2019t reach on our own resulted in our name, The High Water Line.\n\nHailing from upstate New York, holding down the Banjo spot, and singing with his powerful baritone voice, is Tyler Stegall.

A classical violin player, she is both at home playing for symphonies and taking amazing breaks over traditional bluegrass music. Not only is Clare amazing on the fiddle, but she can sing all the parts better than the rest of the band put together. Also from New Jersey, the man responsible for keeping the band in time and bringing the funk, is bass player and singer Jim Toggweiler. Helping to keep the band moving is mandolin player Tj Carskadon, from WI. Tj\u2019s harmony singing and driving backbeat help to define The High Water Line\u2019s unique rhythmic feel. Last, but certainly not least, is our amazing guitar player all the way from Monroe, Georgia, Joel Cofield.

While creating their new track, Monica da Silva and Chad Alger were greatly inspired by their recent move to Los Angeles, the music of the 80s, a love for lush, dreamy pop songs, and all things David Lynch. The Brazilian American duo say that although their new track encompasses more of an electronic, synth-based feel, the lyrical subject matter was based on organic, human emotion.\n\n\u201cShow Me (that you want me) really struck me as an intense idea for a song,\u201d says vocalist da Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s scary how detached we humans have become.

Additionally, they have performed on the 70 000 Tons of Metal Cruise, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res Metalfest, Modified Ghost Festival and Montebello Rockfest while they were preparing new content for their fans and planning their touring schedule for the \u2018\u2019Algorythm\u2019\u2019 album cycle.\n\nStay tuned, Beyond Creation will continue to crush the metal scene and have a lot more good news to share with you in the coming months!", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9211904.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.277791, 37.797058], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: Progressive Death Metal", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Oakland Metro Operahouse"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Uncured", "ArtistBio": "Uncured is a progressive death metal 4-piece from NYC that is attracting international attention for its combination of technical musicianship, brutal riffs, and melodic interludes.\nUncured toured extensively throughout 2017 with some of metal's top acts, including Katatonia, DevilDriver, 36 CrazyFists, and Children of Bodom. Uncured will tour North America with Cradle of Filth in March and April of 2018.\n\nUncured was founded in 2016 by brothers Rex Cox and Zak Cox. Zak and Rex both play guitar and sing. Joining Uncured on drums is Liam Manley from Portland, Oregon. Jon Kita from Boston, Massachusetts, who previously played with metal stalwart Diecast, rounds out the Uncured line-up on bass.\n\nUncured released its first full-length record \"Medusa\" on March 10, 2017. The record was named as one of the \"10 Best Metal Albums of 2017\" by AXS.com. MetalSucks wrote that \"Medusa\" is \"a synthesis of all manner of melodic, progressive, technical metal \u2014 Dream Theater, Opeth, et al. \u2014 mixed with a groovy, almost tribal approach trafficked by \u201990s stalwarts like Sepultura and Fear Factory. Have those two genres ever been mixed together before? Probably, somewhere. Have they ever been mixed together before with such finesse and originality? Certainly not.\"\n\nUncured is quickly gaining a reputation among fans and critics for its aggressive, technical, yet highly diverse live performances. Metal Injection reported that \"Uncured sounds a bit like old school Dream Theater with some modern tricks thrown in, such as full-on breakdowns and smoking guitar acrobatics. This is band comprised of extremely talented and promising young musicians.\"\n\nMetal Assault Magazine reported that \"the talent in musical composition and song arrangement was vastly evident right from the outset, and it never ceased to engage and compel. Uncured\u2019s roots are firmly planted in prog, but also in Scandinavian death metal, and the manner in which they moved from crushing heavy grooves to break into smooth, sexy interludes was beyond exemplary and forced the onlookers to smile in admiration.\" Shutter 16 Magazine simply stated: \"just wow, the raw talent of such a young fronted band is outstanding. Formed, written, and lead by two teenagers, is truly insane.\" The magazine continued that Uncured has \"the sound of old school metal with an influx of modern solos and rhythms, while vocally pulling from a death metal side of things. The solos were the contrast to their music, very progressive sounding and very technical, whereas their song structure was brutal and heavy.\"\n\nCritics have commented on the diversity of Uncured's sound. CrypticRock.com reports that Uncured \"matches speedy, technical guitar riffs with blistering drumming--but the true highlight of Uncured's live set is the ability to slow it down at the drop of a dime, mixing in darker, compelling storylines amidst all the chaos.\" Metal Nexus reviewed Uncured's show in Washington, DC: \"It has been a long time since I have been this utterly impressed by a new band with only a debut album. And how often do you see two vocalists unleashing harsh vocals with intense yet melodic riffs? The young lads with their youthful energy, technical prowess, and blistering speed set the stage on fire.\"\n\nUncured released Spontaneous Generation in 2016, a 4-song instrumental EP. Max Portnoy (son of Dream Theater drumming legend Mike Portnoy) played drums on the EP.\n\nFor more information, contact Mitch Cox, Uncured Manager, by email at mitch@conclavestudios.com.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8510755.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.269962, 37.871601], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: Progressive Metal, Death Metal", "OtherInfo": "All That Remains, Lacuna Coil", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The UC Theatre Taube Family Music Hall"}, {"Address": "522 2nd St, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Arkaik", "ArtistBio": "BACK TO ROSTER\nFacebook B&W\nArkaik erupted into the national death metal scene in 2010 with their debut Unique Leader Records release, \u201cReflections Within Dissonance\u201d.

A native of Leesburg, Florida, Croker is the grandson of the late great jazz trumpeter Doc Cheatham. He began playing trumpet around age 11 after hearing Cheatham play in New York City, and by his teens was studying music at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in Jacksonville, Florida. From 2003 to 2007, Croker attended the music conservatory at Oberlin College. While at Oberlin, he was mentored by legendary trumpeter and educator Donald Byrd. Also during this time, he earned the Presser Music Foundation Award, which funded his debut album, 2006's Fundamentals. After graduating Oberlin, Croker relocated to China, where he took up residency at Shanghai's House of Blues. His 2009 album, In the Tradition, paid tribute to Cheatham.\n\nIn 2013, Croker returned to the States and began work on his third solo album, the Dee Dee Bridgewater-produced Afro Physicist. Released in 2014 on OKeh/Sony Masterworks Records, the Echo Award nominated album found him branching out stylistically, weaving elements of funk, Latin jazz, and hip-hop into his sound. In 2016, he delivered Escape Velocity, which found him delving deeper into a genre-bending, spiritually enlightened, funk-influenced jazz sound.\n\nUpon the album\u2019s release, The Wall Street Journal heralded the album as \u201c timeless and of-the-moment\u201d. His live performances, the Huffington Post lauded Croker\u2019s band DVRKFUNK, saying they were \u201ca tight front line that weave in serpentine precision and are backed by a powerful rhythm section that pushes the groove.\u201d Outside of his solo career, Croker has lent his inimitable talents as composer, arranger and musician to J.

Ellis Paul is one of those gifted singer/songwriters.Though some may refer to him as a folksinger, he is more, for lack of a better word, a singular storyteller, a musician whose words reach out from inside and yet also express the feelings, thoughts and sensibilities that most people can relate to in one way or another, regardless of age or upbringing.

In reality, these stories are a continuation of tales Paul has told for more than a quarter century, over the expanse of nineteen albums, numerous critical kudos (15 Boston Music Awards alone), inclusion in several movie soundtracks, and stages he\u2019s headlined both near and far. \u201cI\u2019ve got a car with over 475,000 miles on it, and it's my third road vehicle,\u201d Paul declares. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing 200 shows a year for over twenty years. There isn\u2019t a town in the country where I won\u2019t find a friend. I\u2019m a nomad. And I\u2019m gonna write and play until I\u2019m gone.\u201d No doubt he will. Still, it\u2019s somewhat ironic that Paul gravitated towards this bigger world of intent and expression given that the place Paul considers his hometown these days isn\u2019t New York or Nashville, or Boston or Austin or Charlottesville, VA. where he lives, but rather Presque Isle, Maine, a tiny enclave surrounded by three rivers. Not surprisingly, the name translates to \u201calmost an island.\u201d Presque Isle shares a vanishing tradition with many small towns these days, where family farms are giving way to industrialization and giant corporations, and earning a livelihood from the land is no longer the simple option it once was. Nevertheless, it\u2019s still a haven for traditional values and for people as real and authentic as the soil they once tilled. If there\u2019s one grace left to cling to, it\u2019s the grace of nature\u2019s beauty, sealed off by the surrounding mountains and fields. Likewise, his geographical origins also couldn\u2019t have been further from the world at large. He was born in the dead of winter in the small town of Fort Kent, Maine, a place nestled right up next to the Canadian border. He came from humble origins, a family of potato farmers who could count among their forebears a veteran of the battle of Gettysburg, whose heroism on that field of honor earned him the 140 acres of Maine farmland that his descendants would continue to sow. It was the place that taught Paul the meaning of hard work and self-reliance, and the values that accompany as much drive and determination any individual could muster. As a boy, Paul found his escape in athletics, working out as a runner and testing his mettle in the open spaces near his home. He became a star competitor, and enjoyed the advantage of traveling throughout the nation after being given opportunities to compete. Along the way, he saw more of the country than most people do in a lifetime. \u201cI was lucky to be able to travel for competitions all over the U.S. and to see places I once could only dream of,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles, the endless plains of Texas, the Kansas prairie, the Rocky Mountain in Wyoming. Every trip was funded by a hat the town passed around on my behalf, and it never came back empty.\u201d When Paul finished second in a nationwide track competition, he was met at the airport by the high school marching band and a fire engine with spinning lights that drove him in triumph through town. In an expression of hometown pride, the mayor handed him the key to the city. No one ever told Paul he had to follow in his family\u2019s tradition. He was a dreamer after all, and he had seen enough of America to know there was more out there than his little town could ever offer. Consequently, his ambitions were never destined to stay bottled up for long. He would write, paint, play trumpet and sing in the school choir. \u201cI never had anyone tell me I had to be a farmer,\u201d Paul insists. \u201cI had plenty of people telling me how my hard work and talent could take me places. That\u2019s enough to get you dreaming, And enough to make you believe those dreams are within reach.\u201d Indeed, Paul found those dreams were within his reach, at least in terms of his imagination. However their pursuit would take him far from home. His first destination was Boston College, courtesy of a track scholarship. Yet as Paul describes it, his athletic endeavors, combined with his academic responsibilities, served to rob him of his creativity. It was only after he suffered a knee injury which forced him to take a year off that he rebounded with a new form of expression, made possible when his girlfriend\u2019s sister gave him a secondhand guitar. \u201cA mysterious, lustful partnership with the instrument followed,\u201d Paul concedes. \u201cIt became a marriage, a friendship, a lifelong bond that only comes when you find that one thing that becomes an extension of yourself. I played for hours, choosing to write my own original songs and sing instead of studying, socializing or exploring what the Boston streets could offer after hours.\u201d After graduation, Paul did find time to explore those paths, while taking opportunities to indulge his creative ambitions. Working as a teacher and social worker with inner city children by day and pursuing the possibilities offered by Boston\u2019s fertile music scene at night, he gained prominence in local coffeehouses and open mic nights. It was the same circuit that opened the door for other like-minded artists of the day, and in turn, gave Paul exposure to such creative contemporaries as Shawn Colvin, Dar Williams, Patty Larkin, John Gorka, Catie Curtis, and Bill Morrissey. It also helped him win a Boston Underground Songwriting competition and placement on a Windham Hill Records singer/songwriter compilation, bringing him his first hint of national exposure at the same time. The major tipping point in his career came with the opportunity to open for Bill Morrissey, one of New England\u2019s most prominent folk artists. Paul would repeatedly ask Morrissey about his own influences and seek his advice on who he ought to listen to. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s a very smart thing to do,\u201d Morrissey muses. \u201cIt helped set him apart. A lot of young singers I meet are not curious about what went on before; they just say, \u2018I want to sing another song about my life.\u2019 Paul has a sense of roots, of connectedness to the whole history of folk music; he sees the thread that runs through all the generations of this music.\u201d It was mutual admiration that caused Paul to ask Morrissey to produce his first full album, 1993\u2018s Say Something. It was released on Black Wolf Records, the label he founded with Ralph Jaccodine, the man who would become his manager. \u201cRalph was fulfilling a dream to get into the music business,\u201d Paul recalls. \u201cStarting with a folk singer isn\u2019t a rocket launch, but we got off the ground. We started a label and began a lifelong, DIY partnership and have been in the trenches for over 20 years.\u201d Paul also became infatuated with the music of Woody Guthrie, drawn to Woody\u2019s social consciousness and the humanitarian streak that ran through his work. He even had a tattoo of Guthrie imprinted on his right shoulder, referring to it as \u201ca badge of who he was.\u201d His commitment to Guthrie\u2019s legacy eventually led to his inclusion in a ten day celebration of Woody\u2019s work held at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 1996, an event that included such notables as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, the Indigo Girls and Ani DiFranco and which was presided over by Guthrie\u2019s daughter Nora. Later, when Guthrie\u2019s hometown of Okemah, Oklahoma hosted the first Woody Guthrie Folk Festival in July, 1998, Paul was tapped as one of the headliners. He has since made this an annual part of his touring schedule, garnering the honor of being named an honorary citizen of Okemah in the process. The connection with Guthrie continued into the new millennium when Nora Guthrie invited him to put music to a set of her father\u2019s lyrics. He later participated in the \u201cRibbon of Highway\u201d tour, a communal salute featuring such luminaries as Arlo Guthrie, Marty Stuart, Ramblin\u2019 Jack Ellott, Nanci Griffith, Guy Clark and Janis Ian, among others. There\u2019s likely no greater evidence of how Guthrie\u2019s insights and humanity have rubbed off on Paul than in this particularly telling tribute from Nora Guthrie. \"A singer songwriter is only as good as the times he reflects,\u201dshe said in praising Paul. \u201cIn times like these, when so many nuts are running the show, it's comforting to know that Ellis Paul is actually holding our sanity on his own stage! Wise, tender, brilliant and biting, Ellis is one of our best human compasses, marking in melodies and poems where we've been and where we might go if we so choose to. Personally Ellis, I'm goin' where you're goin'!\" Where Paul is \u201cgoin\u2019\u201d is to practically every place a microphone beckons and a crowd of the folk faithful awaits. He\u2019s become a staple at the Newport Folk Festival, played Carnegie hall, and venues from Alaska to Miami, Paris and London. In addition to his 19 albums released on the Rounder and Black Wolf record labels, his music has appeared on dozens of distinguished compilations. A Film/DVD entitled 3000 Miles -- part concert film, part documentary, part instructional video -- provides a further prospective on both the man and his music. He\u2019s also released a pair of children\u2019s albums, earning him honors from the Parent\u2019s Choice Foundation for both. His latest, \"The Hero In You\" has been turned into a picture book, detailing the lives of great American heroes. Ellis' literate, evocative and insightful writings are further showcased in a book of poetry and short stories entitled \u201cNotes from the Road,\" already in it's third pressing. It\u2019s no wonder then that recently Paul received a prestigious honor: an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the University of Maine, which also asked him to write the school's alma mater as well as deliver its commencement address in May 2014. Happily, his music has been shared with a wider audience as well, through commercials, documentaries, TV shows and in the soundtracks of several blockbuster films, among them three by the Farrelly Brothers -- \u201cHall Pass\u201d (starring Owen Wilson and Alyssa Milano), \u201cMe, Myself, & Irene\u201d (starring Jim Carrey) and \u201cShallow Hal\u201d (starring Jack Black and Gwyneth Paltrow). Peter Farrelly summed up the sentiments of all those who have come to know and appreciate Paul\u2019s music by referring to him as \u201ca national treasure.\u201d Not surprisingly, Paul\u2019s consistently been heralded by others as well. One writer noted \u201cthat it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music -- storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless, indifferent would, out music doesn\u2019t have to reflect our culture.\" Another reviewer was even more pointed. \u201cEllis Paul is one of the best singer/songwriters of his generation,\u201d she commented. \u201cAnd for many of us he is the face of contemporary folk music. Few are as smart, as literate, as poetic as Paul. I cannot think of another artist on the acoustic music scene is better loved by fans, or more respected by his contemporaries.\u201d Indeed, he is all that, and in a very real sense, even more. He\u2019s an observer, a philosopher, and an astute storyteller who shares with his listeners the life lessons he\u2019s learned, and in turn, life lessons they ought to heed as well. By affirming and defining who he is, Ellis Paul affirms and uncovers the essence of us all. -- Lee Zimmerman (writer/reviewer for American Songwriter, No Depression, New Times, Country Standard Time, Blurt, Relix, and M Music and Musicians) www.EllisPaul.com", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7458566.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.272093, 37.871966], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: Folk, Singer Songwriter, Acoustic", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Back Room Music"}, {"Address": "859 O'Farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Surachai", "ArtistBio": "'Despite his success and sense of history, Mr. Paul remains an artist with his eye on the future and an interest in discovering the transformative potential in his music.' - The New York Times Some artists document their lives through their music.

He even had a tattoo of Guthrie imprinted on his right shoulder, referring to it as \u201ca badge of who he was.\u201d His commitment to Guthrie\u2019s legacy eventually led to his inclusion in a ten day celebration of Woody\u2019s work held at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 1996, an event that included such notables as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, the Indigo Girls and Ani DiFranco and which was presided over by Guthrie\u2019s daughter Nora. Later, when Guthrie\u2019s hometown of Okemah, Oklahoma hosted the first Woody Guthrie Folk Festival in July, 1998, Paul was tapped as one of the headliners. He has since made this an annual part of his touring schedule, garnering the honor of being named an honorary citizen of Okemah in the process. The connection with Guthrie continued into the new millennium when Nora Guthrie invited him to put music to a set of her father\u2019s lyrics. He later participated in the \u201cRibbon of Highway\u201d tour, a communal salute featuring such luminaries as Arlo Guthrie, Marty Stuart, Ramblin\u2019 Jack Ellott, Nanci Griffith, Guy Clark and Janis Ian, among others. There\u2019s likely no greater evidence of how Guthrie\u2019s insights and humanity have rubbed off on Paul than in this particularly telling tribute from Nora Guthrie. \"A singer songwriter is only as good as the times he reflects,\u201dshe said in praising Paul. \u201cIn times like these, when so many nuts are running the show, it's comforting to know that Ellis Paul is actually holding our sanity on his own stage! Wise, tender, brilliant and biting, Ellis is one of our best human compasses, marking in melodies and poems where we've been and where we might go if we so choose to.

He\u2019s become a staple at the Newport Folk Festival, played Carnegie hall, and venues from Alaska to Miami, Paris and London. In addition to his 19 albums released on the Rounder and Black Wolf record labels, his music has appeared on dozens of distinguished compilations. A Film/DVD entitled 3000 Miles -- part concert film, part documentary, part instructional video -- provides a further prospective on both the man and his music. He\u2019s also released a pair of children\u2019s albums, earning him honors from the Parent\u2019s Choice Foundation for both. His latest, \"The Hero In You\" has been turned into a picture book, detailing the lives of great American heroes. Ellis' literate, evocative and insightful writings are further showcased in a book of poetry and short stories entitled \u201cNotes from the Road,\" already in it's third pressing. It\u2019s no wonder then that recently Paul received a prestigious honor: an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the University of Maine, which also asked him to write the school's alma mater as well as deliver its commencement address in May 2014. Happily, his music has been shared with a wider audience as well, through commercials, documentaries, TV shows and in the soundtracks of several blockbuster films, among them three by the Farrelly Brothers -- \u201cHall Pass\u201d (starring Owen Wilson and Alyssa Milano), \u201cMe, Myself, & Irene\u201d (starring Jim Carrey) and \u201cShallow Hal\u201d (starring Jack Black and Gwyneth Paltrow). Peter Farrelly summed up the sentiments of all those who have come to know and appreciate Paul\u2019s music by referring to him as \u201ca national treasure.\u201d Not surprisingly, Paul\u2019s consistently been heralded by others as well. One writer noted \u201cthat it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music -- storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless, indifferent would, out music doesn\u2019t have to reflect our culture.\" Another reviewer was even more pointed. \u201cEllis Paul is one of the best singer/songwriters of his generation,\u201d she commented. \u201cAnd for many of us he is the face of contemporary folk music. Few are as smart, as literate, as poetic as Paul. I cannot think of another artist on the acoustic music scene is better loved by fans, or more respected by his contemporaries.\u201d Indeed, he is all that, and in a very real sense, even more. He\u2019s an observer, a philosopher, and an astute storyteller who shares with his listeners the life lessons he\u2019s learned, and in turn, life lessons they ought to heed as well. By affirming and defining who he is, Ellis Paul affirms and uncovers the essence of us all. -- Lee Zimmerman (writer/reviewer for American Songwriter, No Depression, New Times, Country Standard Time, Blurt, Relix, and M Music and Musicians) www.EllisPaul.com", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/213595.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.418818, 37.784796], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Industrial Metal, Metal, Black Metal, Industrial Rock", "OtherInfo": "Nitzer Ebb", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Great American Music Hall"}, {"Address": "453 Cortland ave, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Blues Jam", "ArtistBio": "'Despite his success and sense of history, Mr. Paul remains an artist with his eye on the future and an interest in discovering the transformative potential in his music.' - The New York Times Some artists document their lives through their music. Others chronicle their times. It\u2019s a rare artist who can do both, telling their own story through songs that also encapsulate the essence of people and places who have helped define their era overall. Woody Guthrie comes to mind, and so does Bob Dylan. Bruce Springsteen certainly as well. Yet few others, for whatever genius they may possess, can relate their own history to the history experienced by those who find that common bond, be it in a coming of age, living through the same realities or sharing similar experiences. Ellis Paul is one of those gifted singer/songwriters.Though some may refer to him as a folksinger, he is more, for lack of a better word, a singular storyteller, a musician whose words reach out from inside and yet also express the feelings, thoughts and sensibilities that most people can relate to in one way or another, regardless of age or upbringing. The exhilaration of the open road. A celebration of heroes. The hope for redemption. Descriptions of those things that are both near and dear. The sharing of love..., intimate, passionate and enduring. These are the scenarios that emerge from Ellis Paul\u2019s new album, Chasing Beauty, a set of songs which detail, in typical Paul fashion, stories of people and places that reflect larger truths about us all. \u201cKick Out the Lights (Johnny Cash)\u201d pays tribute to that fearless American icon name-checked in its title. \u201cPlastic Soldier\u201d offers homage to a wounded soldier returning from Afghanistan. A real-life barnstorming pilot takes the spotlight in \u201cJimmie Angel\u2019s Flying Circus,\u201d while iconic Boston blue collar musician Dennis Brennan takes the focus in \u201cWaiting on a Break.\u201d Even the Empire State Building and the Boston Red Sox get their due, via \u201cEmpire State\u201d and \u201cUK Girl (Boston Calling),\u201d respectively. In reality, these stories are a continuation of tales Paul has told for more than a quarter century, over the expanse of nineteen albums, numerous critical kudos (15 Boston Music Awards alone), inclusion in several movie soundtracks, and stages he\u2019s headlined both near and far. \u201cI\u2019ve got a car with over 475,000 miles on it, and it's my third road vehicle,\u201d Paul declares. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing 200 shows a year for over twenty years. There isn\u2019t a town in the country where I won\u2019t find a friend. I\u2019m a nomad. And I\u2019m gonna write and play until I\u2019m gone.\u201d No doubt he will. Still, it\u2019s somewhat ironic that Paul gravitated towards this bigger world of intent and expression given that the place Paul considers his hometown these days isn\u2019t New York or Nashville, or Boston or Austin or Charlottesville, VA. where he lives, but rather Presque Isle, Maine, a tiny enclave surrounded by three rivers. Not surprisingly, the name translates to \u201calmost an island.\u201d Presque Isle shares a vanishing tradition with many small towns these days, where family farms are giving way to industrialization and giant corporations, and earning a livelihood from the land is no longer the simple option it once was. Nevertheless, it\u2019s still a haven for traditional values and for people as real and authentic as the soil they once tilled. If there\u2019s one grace left to cling to, it\u2019s the grace of nature\u2019s beauty, sealed off by the surrounding mountains and fields. Likewise, his geographical origins also couldn\u2019t have been further from the world at large. He was born in the dead of winter in the small town of Fort Kent, Maine, a place nestled right up next to the Canadian border. He came from humble origins, a family of potato farmers who could count among their forebears a veteran of the battle of Gettysburg, whose heroism on that field of honor earned him the 140 acres of Maine farmland that his descendants would continue to sow. It was the place that taught Paul the meaning of hard work and self-reliance, and the values that accompany as much drive and determination any individual could muster. As a boy, Paul found his escape in athletics, working out as a runner and testing his mettle in the open spaces near his home. He became a star competitor, and enjoyed the advantage of traveling throughout the nation after being given opportunities to compete. Along the way, he saw more of the country than most people do in a lifetime. \u201cI was lucky to be able to travel for competitions all over the U.S. and to see places I once could only dream of,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles, the endless plains of Texas, the Kansas prairie, the Rocky Mountain in Wyoming. Every trip was funded by a hat the town passed around on my behalf, and it never came back empty.\u201d When Paul finished second in a nationwide track competition, he was met at the airport by the high school marching band and a fire engine with spinning lights that drove him in triumph through town. In an expression of hometown pride, the mayor handed him the key to the city. No one ever told Paul he had to follow in his family\u2019s tradition. He was a dreamer after all, and he had seen enough of America to know there was more out there than his little town could ever offer. Consequently, his ambitions were never destined to stay bottled up for long. He would write, paint, play trumpet and sing in the school choir. \u201cI never had anyone tell me I had to be a farmer,\u201d Paul insists. \u201cI had plenty of people telling me how my hard work and talent could take me places. That\u2019s enough to get you dreaming, And enough to make you believe those dreams are within reach.\u201d Indeed, Paul found those dreams were within his reach, at least in terms of his imagination. However their pursuit would take him far from home. His first destination was Boston College, courtesy of a track scholarship. Yet as Paul describes it, his athletic endeavors, combined with his academic responsibilities, served to rob him of his creativity. It was only after he suffered a knee injury which forced him to take a year off that he rebounded with a new form of expression, made possible when his girlfriend\u2019s sister gave him a secondhand guitar. \u201cA mysterious, lustful partnership with the instrument followed,\u201d Paul concedes. \u201cIt became a marriage, a friendship, a lifelong bond that only comes when you find that one thing that becomes an extension of yourself. I played for hours, choosing to write my own original songs and sing instead of studying, socializing or exploring what the Boston streets could offer after hours.\u201d After graduation, Paul did find time to explore those paths, while taking opportunities to indulge his creative ambitions. Working as a teacher and social worker with inner city children by day and pursuing the possibilities offered by Boston\u2019s fertile music scene at night, he gained prominence in local coffeehouses and open mic nights. It was the same circuit that opened the door for other like-minded artists of the day, and in turn, gave Paul exposure to such creative contemporaries as Shawn Colvin, Dar Williams, Patty Larkin, John Gorka, Catie Curtis, and Bill Morrissey. It also helped him win a Boston Underground Songwriting competition and placement on a Windham Hill Records singer/songwriter compilation, bringing him his first hint of national exposure at the same time. The major tipping point in his career came with the opportunity to open for Bill Morrissey, one of New England\u2019s most prominent folk artists. Paul would repeatedly ask Morrissey about his own influences and seek his advice on who he ought to listen to. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s a very smart thing to do,\u201d Morrissey muses. \u201cIt helped set him apart. A lot of young singers I meet are not curious about what went on before; they just say, \u2018I want to sing another song about my life.\u2019 Paul has a sense of roots, of connectedness to the whole history of folk music; he sees the thread that runs through all the generations of this music.\u201d It was mutual admiration that caused Paul to ask Morrissey to produce his first full album, 1993\u2018s Say Something. It was released on Black Wolf Records, the label he founded with Ralph Jaccodine, the man who would become his manager. \u201cRalph was fulfilling a dream to get into the music business,\u201d Paul recalls. \u201cStarting with a folk singer isn\u2019t a rocket launch, but we got off the ground. We started a label and began a lifelong, DIY partnership and have been in the trenches for over 20 years.\u201d Paul also became infatuated with the music of Woody Guthrie, drawn to Woody\u2019s social consciousness and the humanitarian streak that ran through his work.

Steele grew up in a one-stoplight town in South Dakota. Although nobody in her immediate family was musical (her parents are both special education teachers), her love of music began early on. If the TV was on in the house, she was standing three feet away from it singing along with the videos on CMT. Her parents started taking her to concerts when she was young, and she grew up loving everything from Patsy Cline to Patty Loveless to The Eagles to Def Leppard. When she was just 10 years old, Steele opened for Loretta Lynn at a casino in South Dakota, where she befriended a Native American Chief named Dennis Alley. Soon after, Chief Alley began introducing her to all of his musical friends, including BB King, Aaron Neville, Waylon Jennings, and Willie Nelson. By the time she was 15, Willie was inviting Hailey to sing onstage with him during his finale. \"My experience with Willie will always be so special, but when I look back on it now that I'm older, it seems like it was almost spiritual. He\u2019s a huge part of my story.\" Steele\u2019s friendship with Willie and The Chief led her to many unique opportunities, such as performing at Farm Aid and singing a duet with Willie at the historic Corn Palace in Mitchell, SD. At age 19, Hailey moved to Nashville and began writing songs. One of her writing relationships led her to become part of the duo The LiNE, produced by Grammy-nominated songwriter Stephony Smith. The pair spent two seasons on a NASCAR tour, received the rare \u201cfour chair turn\u201d on Season 2 of The Voice (Team Xtina), and even had the honor of performing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. As soon as The Voice ended, Hailey decided to split from The LiNE and started to write for her solo project. \"Being in a duo was a great experience for me. We made a lot of friends and wrote a lot of songs, but at the end of the day I wanted to get back to what my message was, and why I came to Nashville.\" Not long after, Hailey had found herself surrounded by a community of talented artists, writers, producers, and believers. One of those believers was producer Paul \"Relli\" Barber. \"Relli and I had been talking about making a record for four or five years. Either the timing was never right, or we were too busy, or the money wasn't there. But he was always extra invested in the music. Over the course of our friendship, I'd sent him almost every song I'd written.\" One of those songs, \"Getaway Car,\" (co-written with Nathan Chapman) was almost forgotten. \"Getaway Car was on hold for another artist who was in pre-production at the time, so I kind of counted it out for myself. Within the hour that I found out they weren't going to cut it, Relli randomly sent my own demo of Getaway Car to me and said, \"Hey, What about this song?\" We both took it as a sign, and now that song is the first single.\" Another cut from the EP, \u201cYou Made It That Way,\u201d was co-written by Derrick Southerland and Terry McBride. \u201cWe had a write scheduled for February 28th, which is usually when I celebrate my birthday on off years. Normally I would take the day off, but I heard somebody say that it was good luck to work on your birthday. When I walked in, the boys were playing the opening riff of what turned out to be one of my favorite songs I\u2019ve ever written.\u201d McBride, a celebrated songwriter and founder of McBride and the Ride says of Hailey, \u201cI\u2019ve worked with a lot of upcoming artists over the last twenty years. Some you remember and some you forget. But some you just know they have what it takes to make it, and Hailey Steele falls into that category. She has the determination and talent to separate her from the rest of the pack, and a voice that leaves an impression on those who get the chance to hear her.\u201d When it came to the recording process, Relli and Hailey had the opportunity to make the EP in a way that was very unique to Nashville. \"We sat in a studio by ourselves for almost six weeks and came up with parts, and played most of it ourselves, \" Relli said. \"A lot of the arrangements were already there, and some of the parts were derived from Hailey's live band show.\" Once Relli and Hailey had exhausted all of their musical resources (Steele on acoustics, piano, and background vocals, Relli on acoustics, electrics, piano and drum programming), they called in some of their favorite musicians, including Doug Lancio (Patty Griffin), Adam Ollendorff (Kacey Musgraves), Shaun Balin, Jon Rogerson, and Matt Butler (Sheryl Crow). Steele says that this EP will give listeners the perfect idea of who she is, because if you know her songs, you know her. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be any happier with how this EP turned out. Every single note on this thing speaks for who I am as an artist. Now I\u2019m ready to get out there and share it with the world.\u201d Along with the release of her debut EP, Steele will be on tour this fall with singer/songwriter Stephen Kellogg.

Within the hour that I found out they weren't going to cut it, Relli randomly sent my own demo of Getaway Car to me and said, \"Hey, What about this song?\" We both took it as a sign, and now that song is the first single.\" Another cut from the EP, \u201cYou Made It That Way,\u201d was co-written by Derrick Southerland and Terry McBride. \u201cWe had a write scheduled for February 28th, which is usually when I celebrate my birthday on off years. Normally I would take the day off, but I heard somebody say that it was good luck to work on your birthday. When I walked in, the boys were playing the opening riff of what turned out to be one of my favorite songs I\u2019ve ever written.\u201d McBride, a celebrated songwriter and founder of McBride and the Ride says of Hailey, \u201cI\u2019ve worked with a lot of upcoming artists over the last twenty years. Some you remember and some you forget. But some you just know they have what it takes to make it, and Hailey Steele falls into that category. She has the determination and talent to separate her from the rest of the pack, and a voice that leaves an impression on those who get the chance to hear her.\u201d When it came to the recording process, Relli and Hailey had the opportunity to make the EP in a way that was very unique to Nashville. \"We sat in a studio by ourselves for almost six weeks and came up with parts, and played most of it ourselves, \" Relli said. \"A lot of the arrangements were already there, and some of the parts were derived from Hailey's live band show.\" Once Relli and Hailey had exhausted all of their musical resources (Steele on acoustics, piano, and background vocals, Relli on acoustics, electrics, piano and drum programming), they called in some of their favorite musicians, including Doug Lancio (Patty Griffin), Adam Ollendorff (Kacey Musgraves), Shaun Balin, Jon Rogerson, and Matt Butler (Sheryl Crow). Steele says that this EP will give listeners the perfect idea of who she is, because if you know her songs, you know her. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be any happier with how this EP turned out. Every single note on this thing speaks for who I am as an artist. Now I\u2019m ready to get out there and share it with the world.\u201d Along with the release of her debut EP, Steele will be on tour this fall with singer/songwriter Stephen Kellogg. In 2013, she became the youngest member to be inducted into the South Dakota Country Hall of Fame.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6643774.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.416775, 37.739269], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: Hip-hop, Rap, Hip Hop", "OtherInfo": "Rock and Blues Jam with Ed Ivey This classic blues & funk jam session is a popular mid-week event featuring great local blues players.

But at the age of 14, Jake Shimabukuro realized that he was doing something a little different with the four-stringed instrument \u2013 OK, a lot different.\n\nShimabukuro\u2019s wholly unique approach to the ukulele started early. As a youngster growing up in Honolulu, Hawaii, Shimabukuro started playing the instrument at the age of four, learning the basics from his mother, Carol, and then developing his craft further by studying the likes of musical masters such as Eddie Kamae, Ohta-San and Peter Moon.

He\u2019s played with world-renowned orchestras and at prestigious venues such as the Hollywood Bowl, Lincoln Center and the Sydney Opera House, and has dazzled audiences at music festivals including Bonnaroo, SXSW, the Playboy Jazz Festival and Fuji Rock Festival. He even performed for that rarest of audiences: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Not too shabby for a humble young man from Hawaii and his trusty ukulele.\n\nEven with the constant demands on his time \u2013 Shimabukuro tours roughly half the year and makes frequent appearances on media outlets such as The Today Show, Good Morning America, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Conan O\u2019Brien, A Prairie Home Companion and NPR\u2019s Morning Edition \u2013 Shimabukuro\u2019s album output hasn\u2019t slowed. In 2016, he recorded the all-original Nashville Sessions at Music City\u2019s famed Ronnie\u2019s Place studio with producer R.S. Field (Steve Earle, Webb Wilder) and the ace rhythm section of bassist Nolan Verner and drummer Evan Hutchings. And now he\u2019s returned to the same city and studio \u2013 and with the same gang, too (augmented by guitarist Dave Preston) \u2013 for his newest record, The Greatest Day, which will be released on August 31, 2018.\n\n\u201cI had such a great time working with R.S. Field on Nashville Sessions,\u201d Shimabukuro explains, \u201cand I knew I wanted to continue working with him on The Greatest Day. On the last record, it was pretty much the sound of a live trio, which sounded fresh, raw and organic. We were basically writing and improvising in the studio. Now we\u2019ve expanded to a quartet, which has added more colors and variety to the overall production. Once we recorded the live takes, we experimented with overdubs, and added horns, strings and keys, and other funky sounds. There are even some vocals on a few cuts.\u201d\n\nThe 12 tracks that comprise The Greatest Day feature some of Shimabukuro\u2019s most imaginative and adventuresome playing yet. Half of the album is devoted to originals, on which the instrumentalist reaches new heights of compositional distinction. And on the covers, Shimabukuro\u2019s prodigious skills allow him to achieve the impossible, transcending his material \u2013 no mean feat considering some of the classics and standards he\u2019s tackling.\n\nAmong the self-penned tunes, there\u2019s the blissed-out title track, so effervescent and airy that it transports the listener into the clouds. Shimabukuro wrote the song the night before going into the studio. Shimabukuro, Verner and Hutchings recorded their parts first. Later, Dave Preston added a joyous, Edge-like guitar riff that really finished the tune. \u201cIt came together so quickly,\u201d Shimabukuro says, \u201cand when I heard the final mix, I just thought, \u2018Wow, this has been the greatest day!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPangram\u201d has already turned heads in concert. Titled after a sentence that uses all the letters in the alphabet (\u201clike \u2018the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog\u2019\u201d), it\u2019s based on a chromatic scale that utilizes all the notes in the Western music scale. But even non-musicologists will ride happily along its rivers of cascading melodies and its pumping, rock-soul rhythms.\n\nAnother treasure is \u201cStraight A\u2019s,\u201d a carefree and vibrant ride guaranteed to lift spirits, on which Shimabukuro\u2019s soulful soloing recalls one of his influences, Carlos Santana. The song was inspired by the A string on the ukulele. \u201cI wanted to write something where the \u2018A\u2019 note could ring out through the entire song.\u201d\n\n\u201cMahalo John Wayne\u201d is a flat-out stunner, a delicate melody that transforms into a grand-scale cinematic symphony. Discussing its origins, Shimabukuro explains that his father\u2019s favorite actor is John Wayne (\u201cHe named me Jake after one of the Duke\u2019s characters, in the movie \u2018Big Jake\u2019\u201d), and that the two of them would often watch Westerns together. \u201cThose are some great memories of mine,\u201d he says, \u201cso, I\u2019m saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to John Wayne for my name in this song. In Hawaiian, \u2018mahalo\u2019 means \u2018thank you.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs always, Shimabukuro\u2019s playing has a wonderful quality to it \u2013 there\u2019s an innocence, as if each phrase feels new to him. This sense of discovery is abundant on his astonishing reinterpretations of songs such as the Beatles\u2019 \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d now re-imagined as a driving and insistent ballad, brimming with furious jazz chords and a spirited back-and-forth between Shimabukuro and dobro legend Jerry Douglas. \u201cIt was such an honor to have Jerry guest on the record,\u201d Shimabukuro says. \u201cHe was only going to play on one tune, but we had such a great time that he stayed and played on two more tracks. I hope we can do more together one day.\u201d\n\nThe two go toe to toe on Jimi Hendrix\u2019s freak-flag classic \u201cIf 6 Was 9,\u201d spiraling off into a spacey, jazz-rock odyssey that manages to be reverential to the original while simultaneously distinguishing itself as a bold new tour de force. Shimabukuro\u2019s wild wah-wah lines form transfixing sheets of sound, and he even pulls off a neat trick, varying some of his melodies to recall another Hendrix standard, \u201cLittle Wing.\u201d \u201cI wanted to throw in something unexpected, because that\u2019s what I felt like Hendrix would do.\u201d\n\nThe Zombies\u2019 psychedelic rock nugget \u201cTime of the Season\u201d was one Shimabukuro often heard in his house growing up, and on The Greatest Day he trips into nostalgia with an elegant rendition that features some of his smoothest, Wes Montgomery-like phrases. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to play this one for my parents,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as they heard it, they were like, \u2018Oh, wow! You covered the Zombies!\u2019 They thought that was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nThe Greatest Day concludes on a stately note, with a sparse yet exquisite reading of Leonard Cohen\u2019s iconic hymn \u201cHallelujah.\u201d Each line that Shimabukuro plays seeps into one\u2019s heart and soul, proving that music is indeed the universal balm. \u201cI had recorded it before, but after Cohen passed I wanted to re-record it \u2013 I felt a new emotional response to it. It seemed like the perfect way to end the album.\u201d\n\nOnly he didn\u2019t end it there: Shimabukuro was particularly excited about his playing on a recent round of dates with bassist Nolan Verner and guitarist Dave Preston. The addition of a guitarist allowed him to solo more expressively than ever before. The digital edition of The Greatest Day includes a beautiful live version of \u201cBlue Roses Falling\u201d that features Shimabukuro dueting with cellist Meena Cho as well as a concert recording of \u201cKawika\u201d (originally made famous by the Sunday Manoa).\n\nThe CD and vinyl versions of the album include both tracks along with three more cuts including immersive takes on \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d and Shimabukuro\u2019s own \u201cDragon,\u201d. There\u2019s even a slinky, ultra-funky interpretation of Bill Withers\u2019 hit single \u201cUse Me\u201d that sees Preston showing off his soulful vocal chops. They were recorded live with no overdubs at various venues by engineer Brett Lind and mixed by Jack Clarke (who engineered Nashville Sessions and The Greatest Day).\n\nShimabukuro has already been performing some of the material from The Greatest Day live, and he\u2019ll soon work more songs into his set. In mid-July, he embarks on an extensive tour of the U.S and a fall tour of Japan. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to play the new songs in my shows,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking this record was one of the highlights I\u2019ve had in the studio. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the sounds and arrangements. But most of all, we had a ton of fun making it.\u201d\n\nAlong with his tremendous professional achievements, Shimabukuro\u2019s personal life is filled with riches: He\u2019s a loving husband and proud father of two boys. While balancing career with family, he also remains firmly rooted in his commitment to community, frequently performing at schools in Hawaii and overseas, urging youngsters to find their passion and live drug-free.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8534039.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.448345, 37.802902], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "Genres: Instrumental, Acoustic, Pop", "OtherInfo": "Shimabukuro\u2019s busy touring schedule is complemented by a rich and varied catalog of albums that capture the many moods of the uke.", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Palace Of Fine Arts Theatre"}, {"Address": "406 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Andrew Bundy", "ArtistBio": "Almost everyone in Hawaii has strummed a ukulele at one time or another.

This sense of discovery is abundant on his astonishing reinterpretations of songs such as the Beatles\u2019 \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d now re-imagined as a driving and insistent ballad, brimming with furious jazz chords and a spirited back-and-forth between Shimabukuro and dobro legend Jerry Douglas. \u201cIt was such an honor to have Jerry guest on the record,\u201d Shimabukuro says. \u201cHe was only going to play on one tune, but we had such a great time that he stayed and played on two more tracks. I hope we can do more together one day.\u201d\n\nThe two go toe to toe on Jimi Hendrix\u2019s freak-flag classic \u201cIf 6 Was 9,\u201d spiraling off into a spacey, jazz-rock odyssey that manages to be reverential to the original while simultaneously distinguishing itself as a bold new tour de force. Shimabukuro\u2019s wild wah-wah lines form transfixing sheets of sound, and he even pulls off a neat trick, varying some of his melodies to recall another Hendrix standard, \u201cLittle Wing.\u201d \u201cI wanted to throw in something unexpected, because that\u2019s what I felt like Hendrix would do.\u201d\n\nThe Zombies\u2019 psychedelic rock nugget \u201cTime of the Season\u201d was one Shimabukuro often heard in his house growing up, and on The Greatest Day he trips into nostalgia with an elegant rendition that features some of his smoothest, Wes Montgomery-like phrases. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to play this one for my parents,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as they heard it, they were like, \u2018Oh, wow! You covered the Zombies!\u2019 They thought that was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nThe Greatest Day concludes on a stately note, with a sparse yet exquisite reading of Leonard Cohen\u2019s iconic hymn \u201cHallelujah.\u201d Each line that Shimabukuro plays seeps into one\u2019s heart and soul, proving that music is indeed the universal balm. \u201cI had recorded it before, but after Cohen passed I wanted to re-record it \u2013 I felt a new emotional response to it. It seemed like the perfect way to end the album.\u201d\n\nOnly he didn\u2019t end it there: Shimabukuro was particularly excited about his playing on a recent round of dates with bassist Nolan Verner and guitarist Dave Preston. The addition of a guitarist allowed him to solo more expressively than ever before. The digital edition of The Greatest Day includes a beautiful live version of \u201cBlue Roses Falling\u201d that features Shimabukuro dueting with cellist Meena Cho as well as a concert recording of \u201cKawika\u201d (originally made famous by the Sunday Manoa).\n\nThe CD and vinyl versions of the album include both tracks along with three more cuts including immersive takes on \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d and Shimabukuro\u2019s own \u201cDragon,\u201d. There\u2019s even a slinky, ultra-funky interpretation of Bill Withers\u2019 hit single \u201cUse Me\u201d that sees Preston showing off his soulful vocal chops. They were recorded live with no overdubs at various venues by engineer Brett Lind and mixed by Jack Clarke (who engineered Nashville Sessions and The Greatest Day).\n\nShimabukuro has already been performing some of the material from The Greatest Day live, and he\u2019ll soon work more songs into his set. In mid-July, he embarks on an extensive tour of the U.S and a fall tour of Japan. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to play the new songs in my shows,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking this record was one of the highlights I\u2019ve had in the studio. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the sounds and arrangements. But most of all, we had a ton of fun making it.\u201d\n\nAlong with his tremendous professional achievements, Shimabukuro\u2019s personal life is filled with riches: He\u2019s a loving husband and proud father of two boys. While balancing career with family, he also remains firmly rooted in his commitment to community, frequently performing at schools in Hawaii and overseas, urging youngsters to find their passion and live drug-free.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9308728.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.463777, 37.783225], "Date": "Wed Oct 2 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-02", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "Gabriel Lynch, Andrew Bundy, Matt Herrero at Neck of the Woods", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Neck Of the Woods"}, {"Address": "453 Cortland ave, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Rock", "ArtistBio": "Almost everyone in Hawaii has strummed a ukulele at one time or another. But at the age of 14, Jake Shimabukuro realized that he was doing something a little different with the four-stringed instrument \u2013 OK, a lot different.\n\nShimabukuro\u2019s wholly unique approach to the ukulele started early. As a youngster growing up in Honolulu, Hawaii, Shimabukuro started playing the instrument at the age of four, learning the basics from his mother, Carol, and then developing his craft further by studying the likes of musical masters such as Eddie Kamae, Ohta-San and Peter Moon. As he matured, Shimabukuro also found inspiration from guitar players, drummers, pianists, and singers. Even athletes helped fuel the intensity of his artistic fire.\n\nIn 2005, Shimabukuro\u2019s touring career really came to life with a video on YouTube. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what YouTube was at the time, so I was totally surprised when people started telling me they\u2019d seen a video of me playing \u2018While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBefore I got a chance to check it out myself, the video had gone viral and a lot of music industry folks seemed to know about it. It was crazy!\u201d Shimabukuro\u2019s deeply beautiful and original take on George Harrison\u2019s love ballad, one which captured colors and moods never associated with the ukulele before, opened the floodgates \u2013 now legions of new music lovers had to hear this instrumental marvel \u2013 and the 2006 release of Gently Weeps (produced by Mac McAnally), which mixed his own originals with equally adventurous versions of \u201cAve Maria\u201d and \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d was an unqualified success.\n\nShimabukuro\u2019s records have topped the Billboard World Music Charts on numerous occasions, and as a live performer he has become one of the hottest tickets around. He\u2019s played with world-renowned orchestras and at prestigious venues such as the Hollywood Bowl, Lincoln Center and the Sydney Opera House, and has dazzled audiences at music festivals including Bonnaroo, SXSW, the Playboy Jazz Festival and Fuji Rock Festival. He even performed for that rarest of audiences: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Not too shabby for a humble young man from Hawaii and his trusty ukulele.\n\nEven with the constant demands on his time \u2013 Shimabukuro tours roughly half the year and makes frequent appearances on media outlets such as The Today Show, Good Morning America, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Conan O\u2019Brien, A Prairie Home Companion and NPR\u2019s Morning Edition \u2013 Shimabukuro\u2019s album output hasn\u2019t slowed. In 2016, he recorded the all-original Nashville Sessions at Music City\u2019s famed Ronnie\u2019s Place studio with producer R.S. Field (Steve Earle, Webb Wilder) and the ace rhythm section of bassist Nolan Verner and drummer Evan Hutchings. And now he\u2019s returned to the same city and studio \u2013 and with the same gang, too (augmented by guitarist Dave Preston) \u2013 for his newest record, The Greatest Day, which will be released on August 31, 2018.\n\n\u201cI had such a great time working with R.S. Field on Nashville Sessions,\u201d Shimabukuro explains, \u201cand I knew I wanted to continue working with him on The Greatest Day. On the last record, it was pretty much the sound of a live trio, which sounded fresh, raw and organic. We were basically writing and improvising in the studio. Now we\u2019ve expanded to a quartet, which has added more colors and variety to the overall production. Once we recorded the live takes, we experimented with overdubs, and added horns, strings and keys, and other funky sounds. There are even some vocals on a few cuts.\u201d\n\nThe 12 tracks that comprise The Greatest Day feature some of Shimabukuro\u2019s most imaginative and adventuresome playing yet. Half of the album is devoted to originals, on which the instrumentalist reaches new heights of compositional distinction. And on the covers, Shimabukuro\u2019s prodigious skills allow him to achieve the impossible, transcending his material \u2013 no mean feat considering some of the classics and standards he\u2019s tackling.\n\nAmong the self-penned tunes, there\u2019s the blissed-out title track, so effervescent and airy that it transports the listener into the clouds. Shimabukuro wrote the song the night before going into the studio. Shimabukuro, Verner and Hutchings recorded their parts first. Later, Dave Preston added a joyous, Edge-like guitar riff that really finished the tune. \u201cIt came together so quickly,\u201d Shimabukuro says, \u201cand when I heard the final mix, I just thought, \u2018Wow, this has been the greatest day!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPangram\u201d has already turned heads in concert. Titled after a sentence that uses all the letters in the alphabet (\u201clike \u2018the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog\u2019\u201d), it\u2019s based on a chromatic scale that utilizes all the notes in the Western music scale. But even non-musicologists will ride happily along its rivers of cascading melodies and its pumping, rock-soul rhythms.\n\nAnother treasure is \u201cStraight A\u2019s,\u201d a carefree and vibrant ride guaranteed to lift spirits, on which Shimabukuro\u2019s soulful soloing recalls one of his influences, Carlos Santana. The song was inspired by the A string on the ukulele. \u201cI wanted to write something where the \u2018A\u2019 note could ring out through the entire song.\u201d\n\n\u201cMahalo John Wayne\u201d is a flat-out stunner, a delicate melody that transforms into a grand-scale cinematic symphony. Discussing its origins, Shimabukuro explains that his father\u2019s favorite actor is John Wayne (\u201cHe named me Jake after one of the Duke\u2019s characters, in the movie \u2018Big Jake\u2019\u201d), and that the two of them would often watch Westerns together. \u201cThose are some great memories of mine,\u201d he says, \u201cso, I\u2019m saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to John Wayne for my name in this song. In Hawaiian, \u2018mahalo\u2019 means \u2018thank you.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs always, Shimabukuro\u2019s playing has a wonderful quality to it \u2013 there\u2019s an innocence, as if each phrase feels new to him. This sense of discovery is abundant on his astonishing reinterpretations of songs such as the Beatles\u2019 \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d now re-imagined as a driving and insistent ballad, brimming with furious jazz chords and a spirited back-and-forth between Shimabukuro and dobro legend Jerry Douglas. \u201cIt was such an honor to have Jerry guest on the record,\u201d Shimabukuro says. \u201cHe was only going to play on one tune, but we had such a great time that he stayed and played on two more tracks. I hope we can do more together one day.\u201d\n\nThe two go toe to toe on Jimi Hendrix\u2019s freak-flag classic \u201cIf 6 Was 9,\u201d spiraling off into a spacey, jazz-rock odyssey that manages to be reverential to the original while simultaneously distinguishing itself as a bold new tour de force. Shimabukuro\u2019s wild wah-wah lines form transfixing sheets of sound, and he even pulls off a neat trick, varying some of his melodies to recall another Hendrix standard, \u201cLittle Wing.\u201d \u201cI wanted to throw in something unexpected, because that\u2019s what I felt like Hendrix would do.\u201d\n\nThe Zombies\u2019 psychedelic rock nugget \u201cTime of the Season\u201d was one Shimabukuro often heard in his house growing up, and on The Greatest Day he trips into nostalgia with an elegant rendition that features some of his smoothest, Wes Montgomery-like phrases. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to play this one for my parents,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as they heard it, they were like, \u2018Oh, wow!

Although Migs always loved and listened to all different styles of music, in the early 90\u2019s he connected to the soulful sounds of Deep House. By the mid \u201990s he began experimenting with producing electronic dance music. And by the time the new millennium dawned, a string of releases and remixes on numerous leading indie dance labels earned him an enviable reputation among discerning dance music fans worldwide.

To read various descriptions from magazines and reviews, you might feel like you couldn't be reading about the same band. From chamber music to black metal to goth to jazz and avant-garde classical -- nothing really fits. Is Hubardo the \"true\" Kayo Dot? Is Coffins on Io? Choirs of the Eye? Does the question need an answer? Toby Driver, the primary composer and frontman for the band, has been fiercely productive over the years, and while that usually refers to how many songs or albums an artist has made, with Driver the productivity is in the realm of ideas as much as music itself.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9416197.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.769989, 37.680587], "Date": "Thu Oct 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-03", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Monica's Livermore"}, {"Address": "84 Bartlett St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Manos Lindas", "ArtistBio": "Manos Lindas is the product of what its name suggests.

Co-produced by Waldon and Dan Knobler, the collection opens with a confident anthem, \u201cAnyhow,\u201d which finds the Nashville-based songwriter forging ahead after some frustrating setbacks.\n\n\u201cThe past three years since we put a record out, we\u2019ve seen some of the biggest ups and downs, like exciting things happening, and not-so-exciting things happening. We kept going and it\u2019s all about that process,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the title alludes to things going on around us, in the world and in our environment. I do think there is a lot of white noise. That title describes where I\u2019m at.\u201d\n\nThe song \u201cWhite Noise, White Lines\u201d is inspired by a pivotal weekend in August 2017. While driving to see her family in her hometown of Monkey\u2019s Eyebrow, Kentucky, Waldon had an epiphany that everything was going to turn out all right. She\u2019d just turned 30 and had fallen in love again. A stunning solar eclipse that occurred directly over Nashville left her in awe. Meanwhile, during her visit home, she befriended a few members of the Chickasaw Tribe who were staying at her father\u2019s hunting lodge. Each of those experiences ended up in the song, including some tribal chants she recorded on her phone, added later with the tribe\u2019s blessing.\n\nSonic snapshots of Waldon\u2019s life are nestled into the album, without ever taking a listener out of the experience. For example, she dropped in a voicemail from her father, who\u2019d called to say he just heard her on the radio. Then she condenses her life story into four minutes with \u201cKentucky 1988,\u201d sharing some rough parts of her childhood but acknowledging that she wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. She draws on a historical battle in the Bluegrass State on \u201cBlack Patch,\u201d which is followed by a snippet of her friends playing and singing the bluegrass tune, \u201cRun Rabbit Run.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was on my birthday and we were having a picking party,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI wanted the record to feel personal and untainted. I also wanted to show that bluegrass is a huge part of everything about me.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Kentucky, Waldon took piano lessons but shifted to guitar when she was 12. Her mom bought her a 10-track recorder so she could start recording the songs she was writing. She nurtured her singing talent at county fairs and in church, then decided to move to Nashville at the age of 19 to pursue a music career. Overworked and broke, she moved back home after a year and enrolled in community college. After being accepted by Belmont University, she zeroed in on songwriting courses and became the first person in her family to earn a diploma.\n\nTo make ends meet, she spent three years working as a bartender at the Nashville Palace, but when a booking agency started getting her on the road regularly, she bought a van and hired a band \u2013 and she\u2019s been touring almost constantly since then. In 2016, she made her long-awaited debut on the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nThus, it\u2019s no surprise to hear Waldon singing \u201cRun Away,\u201d a traditional country weeper about falling for someone whose life is a wreck \u2013 even though a simmering arrangement on the following track, \u201cSunday\u2019s Children,\u201d gives that song an aura of empowerment. Waldon wrote \u201cVery Old Barton\u201d about binge drinking alone, with the hopeful message of getting through the highs and lows of life.\n\nA bold centerpiece of the album, Waldon offers an impassioned protest song with \u201cLived and Let Go.\u201d She explains, \u201cA lot of times, I tend to write because I have to make sense of the world around me. We\u2019re all here for such a short time and it seems so silly that we get angry about things that I think are very fleeting. It\u2019s a message of hope for all injustice to end and for our wounds to be healed. Overall, it\u2019s a message of unity for all people.\u201d\n\nThat surging emotion is evident in the way Waldon plays acoustic guitar on the track \u2013 as she does throughout the album. She notes, \u201cI\u2019m as influenced by Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan as anybody else, and all kinds of folk singers.\u201d\n\nThat affinity for all genres is especially clear when she lists her influences, from The Band and The Meters, to Hazel Dickens and Ralph Stanley, to Ann Peebles and Bill Withers, and all the country legends you can name. She\u2019s also been invited to open shows for one of her biggest songwriting heroes, John Prine, and to sing \u201cParadise\u201d with him during his set.\n\nThus it made sense for White Noise, White Lines to close with a song by someone she admires. Her stirring rendition of Ola Belle Reed\u2019s \u201cMy Epitaph\u201d underscores the young songwriter\u2019s musical desire to speak up and speak now.\n\n\u201cEverything that I\u2019m influenced by is all across the board.

Recorded at Brotheryn Studios with Siebenberg, Results Not Typical Part I features solid performances from drummer Joey Waronker (Beck, REM, Paul McCartney), bassist Johnathan Flaugher (Ryan Adams), bassist Gabe Noel (Afghan Whigs, Father John Misty), guitarist Jason Soda (Miranda Lee Richards), violinist Paul Cartwright (Father John Misty), pianist Dave Palmer (T-Bone Burnett), and pianist Aaron Embry (Willie Nelson, Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros). After years of wanting to make a record with a world class line up, it was finally happening.\n\nResults Not Typical Part I, Jones\u2019 second solo effort, is the result of advice given to \u201cpick a lane\u201d, or combining songs with a similar sound, theme and genre on one record. Ian sat down and worked on a central theme which started out as a basic chord progression and set of riffs. A majority of the songs from this project are just a theme and variation on those chords and riffs, or this \u201clane\u201d. Jones brought in a handful of previously written songs such as Rollin which is a song about his time spent touring, and Goodbyes Are The Hardest Words which is a song he penned prior to his move from Seattle to California in 1999. The first song written with this theme is Athens Smiles which is a story about a girl on tour from Athens GA, that Jones had played a show with a few years earlier. Even though the writing theme is consistent, Siebenberg was able to put the recording together in such a way that the songs flow into each other without sounding the same.\n\nIan had started this recording project in Seattle in 2015 but it got off to a rough start. \u201cIt seemed like I was just not supposed to make this record in Seattle\u201d Jones said. After consulting with a few friends in Seattle, Jones turned to his California music friends for advice. Santa Barbara native John Mooy suggested mutual friend and musical colleague Jesse Siebenberg, as he was taking some time off after having his new son. One thing led to another and the long-distance pre-production process began. On a brief west coast tour in 2016, Jones visited Ojai and Brotheryn studios and the schedule was set, songs selected and line up of players made final. A few months later over a long weekend, the tracks were cut live over a two-day period, and Results Not Typical Part I came to life. Over the next few months, overdubs were added and Seibenberg rounded out the sound with his additions.\n\nNo stranger to the recording studio, Results Not Typical Part I is Jones\u2019 second true professionally produced solo album. Having worked in many studios over the last 20 years including legendary Cello Studios in LA, and Avast and London Bridge in Seattle, Jones states \u201cI\u2019ve taken all the mistakes and lessons I\u2019ve learned in the studio over the years and put them to work on this project. It\u2019s been a long journey, but I feel I\u2019ve finally hit my stride\u201d. He adds, \u201cThis EP is the first half of what is going to be an amazing record. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the guys or the process and Jesse is truly amazing.\u201d Jones is looking forward to hitting the road in the spring of 2018 to support Results Not Typical Part I and complete the last 6 songs of the forthcoming LP Results Not Typical.", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.789231, 38.042165], "Date": "Thu Oct 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-03", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Alt-Country, Country, Folk Rock", "OtherInfo": "House concert.

On this recording, Valdes is again featured with his Afro-Cuban Messengers, and the compositions include nods to flamenco, the Gnawa music of Morocco and the ritual rhythms of the Orishas, the deities of the Afro-Cuban Santer\u00eda religion. There are mentions of hard-bop and danz\u00f3n but also echoes of Bach, Rachmaninoff and Miles Davis -- and yet the sum total is a deeply personal and open-ended sound. And it\u2019s all Chucho Vald\u00e9s.\n\n\u201cSince I was a student I had this idea of taking disparate elements, mixing them and seeing what happened. And little by little, over time, I\u2019ve found my ways,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cAnd I love it because it\u2019s a search that forces you to investigate and study. It\u2019s not all about Afro-Cuban music. I\u2019m always looking for new things.\u201d\n\nThe concept in Border-Free \u201cwas to do many different things but all in my own style. Now, that is something very difficult to achieve.\u201d\n\nDionisio Jes\u00fas \"Chucho\" Vald\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, was born in a family of musicians in Quivic\u00e1n, Havana province, Cuba, October 9, 1941. His first teachers were his father, the pianist, composer and bandleader Ram\u00f3n \u201cBebo\u201d Vald\u00e9s, and his mother Pilar Rodr\u00edguez, who sang and played the piano.\n\nAt the age of three, Chucho already played at the piano, using both hands, in any key, melodies he heard on the radio. In fact, there is a famous anecdote that tells the story of Bebo tricking his friend, the late Israel \u201cCachao\u201d Lopez, about checking out, with his back to the player, \u201ca young North American pianist.\u201d Chucho was then four years old.\n\nAt the age of five, Chucho began to take lessons on piano, theory and solfege with maestro Oscar Mu\u00f1oz Boufartique. He continued his studies at the Conservatorio Municipal de M\u00fasica de la Habana, from which he graduated at 14. Chucho also took private lessons from Zenaida Romeu, Rosario Franco, Federico Smith and Leo Brouwer.\n\n\u201cAt home he played jazz: the music of Ellington, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller\u2019s band. I\u2019ve been privileged. Because Bebo was the piano player at the Tropicana I could see true legend of jazz in person. He took me to see Nat King Cole, Errol Garner and Sarah Vaughan when I was child studying music. You can\u2019t imagine the effect that had on my life! It was enormous! Magical!\nAt 15 Chucho formed his first jazz trio end in December 1958 he worked as a pianist at the Deauville and St. John hotels in Havana. In 1959, he debuted with the orchestra Sabor de Cuba, directed by his father, Bebo. That band accompanied the top singers of that era such as Rolando Laserie, Fernando \u00c1lvarez and P\u00edo Leyva.\n\n\u201cMy father taught me everything about Cuban music, South American music, jazz, and how to work with an orchestra,\u201d reminisces Chucho. \u201c He gave me the piano chair, and stayed on as director, so I could learn how to work under a conductor. We did our shows and a million other things with that orchestra, including accompanying shows at the Havana Hilton. I learned a lot there. He is my idol, \u201che pauses, then continues. \u201cI don\u00b4t say was, my idol. He is my idol. He was my teacher. He still is.\u201d\n\nChucho\u2019s family and professional life took a dramatic turn in 1960 when his father left to work in Mexico and from there he moved to Europe, where he eventually settled. Bebo Vald\u00e9s never returned to Cuba. (Father and son saw each other again 18 years later at Carnegie Hall, where Chucho was debuting in the United States with his group Irakere. The relationship was fully restored in 2000, when they met again to play a duet on Calle 54, a film about Latin jazz by Oscar winning Spanish director Fernando Trueba. The father and son reunion culminated, musically, in Juntos Para Siempre, a 2007 duet recording that won both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy. Bebo Vald\u00e9s died on March 22, 2013. He was 94.)\n\nIn the early \u201860s, Chucho worked as a pianist at the Teatro Mart\u00ed (1961), the Sal\u00f3n Internacional del Hotel Habana Riviera (1963) and the orchestra of the Teatro Musical de la Habana (1964-67). In 1967, and after a suggestion of his old teacher, the great guitarist, composer and director Leo Brouwer, Chucho organized his own combo.\n\nStill, that same year he joins the important Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, then directed by maestros Armando Romeu and Rafael Somavilla. While a member of the orchestra, Chucho revisited the idea of a small group and, in 1970, he appeared at the Jazz Jamboree in Poland leading his own quintet.\n\nIn 1972, after recording Jazz Bat\u00e1, an album featuring an unusual jazz trio comprising bassist Carlos del Puerto and singer and percussionist Oscar Vald\u00e9s on bat\u00e1 (the traditional hourglass shaped drums used in the ritual music of the Orishas), Chucho decided to enlarge the group adding brass and trap drums. That\u00b4s the genesis, in 1973, of Irakere, a small, Cuban-style big band that played an explosive mix of jazz, rock, classical music and traditional Cuban music, including Afro-Cuban religious music and instruments.\n\n\u201cThe ideas for the brass have to do with the work we did with the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, which was a great big band,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cI tried to imitate that with four horns -- two trumpets, a alto and a tenor sax -- and with just that try to have the sound of a big band. Of course when you have monster players like Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, [trumpeter] Jorge Varona and [saxophonist] Carlos Averhoff you can write anything you want and it will work.\u201d\nIrakere first made its mark internationally in Finland in 1976. But the following year, the band was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie in a visit to Havana on a jazz cruise that also included pianist Earl \u201cFatha\u201d Hines and saxophonist Stan Getz. In 1978 the producer Bruce Lundvall, then president of CBS, signed the band for the label. Irakere debuted, unannounced, as \u201csurprise guests,\u201d at Carnegie Hall as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. As fate would have it, the program that night also featured pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, two of Chucho\u2019s main influences.\n\nSelections from Irakere\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival comprised the repertory of Irakere (CBS) their debut recording in the United States. The album won a Grammy as Best Latin Recording in 1979.\n\nThe group went on to create an extraordinary body of work that includes great dance recordings such as Homenaje a Beny Mor\u00e9 (Pimienta, 1989) and Indestructible (Sony, 1997); explorations of Afro-Cuban religious music such as Babal\u00fa Ay\u00e9 (Bemb\u00e9, 1999) featuring the great Orisha music singer L\u00e1zaro Ros; as well as ambitious projects such as Tierra En Trance (Are\u00edto, 1983) and Misa Negra (Messidor, 1987)\n\nIrakere\u2019s lineup went through many changes over the years. Throughout, Chucho remained as the one, great constant. But success had its costs. Except for the remarkable solo outing Lucama (Mission, 1986), his talent as a pianist was largely out of sight, obscured by his other obligations with the band.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1997, Chucho won his second Grammy for his work on Habana (Verve) as a member of trumpeter Roy Hargrove\u2019s Crisol. The following year, while not completely leaving Irakere behind, Chucho started a parallel career as a solo player and quartet leader, looking for greater opportunities to explore and showcase his playing.\n\n\u201cTwenty five years with the same band is a long time,\u201d said Chucho at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to play solo and with a quartet for some time now. My work as a pianist and soloist gets diluted in Irakere. My job in the group is to be the composer, arranger and musical director and that\u2019s a completely different role.\u201d\n\nChucho stayed with Irakere until 2005.\n\nThe fruitful period that followed is highlighted by albums such as Solo Piano (Blue Note, 1991), Solo: Live in New York (Blue Note, 2001) and New Conceptions (Blue Note, 2003), as well as quartet recordings such as Bele Bele en La Habana (Blue Note, 1998), Briyumba Palo Congo (Blue Note, 1999) and Live at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note, 2000), capturing a performance that features Chucho\u2019s sister, singer Mayra Caridad Vald\u00e9s . The recording won a Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album.\n\nThere were also Grammy awards for the already mentioned Juntos Para Siempre (Calle 54, 2007), the duet recording with Bebo; and for Chucho\u2019s Steps (Comanche, 2010), featuring his new group, the Afro-Cuban Messengers .\n\nIn total, Chucho has won five Grammys and three Latin Grammys.\n\nIn 2012, Chucho reorganized his Afro-Cuban Messengers which currently feature Yaroldy Abreu, percussion, Dreiser Durruthy Bombal\u00e9 , bat\u00e1 drums and voice; Reinaldo Meli\u00e1n, trumpet, Gast\u00f3n Joya, bass and Rodney Barreto, drums.\n\nHis most recent production, Border-Free, is yet another expression of the continuing musical search and evolution of Chucho Vald\u00e9s as a pianist, composer, arranger and director.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9040181.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Thu Oct 3 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-03", "Genre": "Genres: Latin-Jazz", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "SFJAZZ Center - Miner Auditorium"}, {"Address": "15791 US Hwy 63, Hayward, WI 54843", "Artist": "Chad Kostner", "ArtistBio": "Born by chance in the windy city and raised in the small Wisconsin farming community of Bloomer, he somehow managed to inherit the musical genomes of both areas.

The five-piece started life in 2010 as a more-or-less straightforward hardcore punk act, but over the course of their first three albums \u2013 2013\u2019s I\u2019m Not Right, 2015\u2019s Bad Blood and 2017\u2019s Lucid Again \u2013 were steadily evolving and mutating their sound in whatever direction they felt like. It was always loud, but it became both more nuanced and more off-kilter. New record Nature/Nurture, which is released on April 12, sees the band continuing down that snaking path \u2013 it\u2019s 11 songs swerving right and left abruptly and unexpectedly, veering from frantic punk to slower, more nuanced and psychedelic-tinged rock. And while it might not always make sense, these songs still sound like Clowns; because when Clowns don\u2019t sound like Clowns, they actually do \u2013 a paradox that vocalist Stevie Williams is very much aware of.\n\n\u201cNature/Nurture is an amalgamation of our last three records, which we\u2019ve made over the last 6 or so years,\u201d he says. \u201cOur line-up has been a little bit fluid over the years, but this record is the band really coming to fruition with this line-up and with all the different sounds that we\u2019ve experimented with over the years \u2013 everywhere from super-adolescent punk rock to nine-minute long psych jams.\u201d\n\nNow completed by drummer and founding member Jake Laderman, bassist/vocalist Hanny J and guitarists Rod Goon and Will Robinson, Clowns have become something of a force to be reckoned with in recent years. When the band began, Williams says that his end goal was to one day sell out the Corner Hotel in Melbourne, a venue that was instrumental in his years growing up. That seemingly unachievable ambition from his teen years was ticked off the bucket list while touring Lucid Again. Then, in 2018, the band played in front of 56,000 people when they supported Foo Fighters in Melbourne and hit the stage at the world\u2019s biggest heavy music festival, Wacken Open Air. \u201cIt\u2019s all a little bit mind-blowing,\u201d laughs Williams, \u201cbecause at the end of 2017 I realized \u2018Holy shit, I\u2019ve actually done everything that I wanted to do!\u2019 \u201cAnd now this is my job and I can\u2019t escape it.

The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Dolly Parton, Neil Young, Willie Nelson, and Bruce Springsteen are just a few of the artists who have had their work re-imagined by Bettye.\nNow, in her 55th year in show business, she has been signed to Verve Records, and has recorded an album of all Bob Dylan songs.

Pulling from lead guitarist and singer Brian J\u2019s deep discography of influences, the creation of Jukestone Paradise began a decade ago, when he penned anthems like \u201cSky\u201d and \u201cFreedom Dancer,\u201d all the way up to the album\u2019s studio recording sessions.\n\nYou might accurately call the Pimps of Joytime a \u2018post-genre\u2019 band; they\u2019re a group whose sound\u2014even within a single song\u2014mirrors the diversity of our era\u2019s musical tastes. \u201cIt\u2019s a sonic tapestry that\u2019s representative of this time and place that we live in,\u201d says Brian J.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Pimps excel, by mashing up \u201870s funk tones with modern dance beats, mixed with original samples creating their mosaic sound. For listeners weary of today\u2019s DJ culture but eager to dance with abandon, the Pimps of Joytime are the antidote.\n\n\u201cAt our core, the Pimps of Joytime are not just dance music,\u201d says Brian J of the band\u2019s three-part harmony attack. \u201cMy first vocal mentor was a doo-wop singer, so I have a long-time love affair with vocal harmonies.\u201d\n\nWith the release of Jukestone Paradise, the band makes official their solid touring lineup, featuring dual female vocalists and percussionists Mayteana Morales and Cole WilliamsX. And they\u2019re hitting the road hard, continuing a constant touring schedule that\u2019s already left prominent sets at festivals like Voodoo, Outside Lands, Bonnaroo and High Sierra in their wake.\n\nBehind the frontlines are bassist/keyboardist David Bailis and drummer John Staten, forming the rhythmic backbone of the Pimps\u2019 audible collage. And for Jukestone Paradise, they called in a few friends to lend their talents, including Ivan Neville, who lends New Orleans flavor to \u201cSky,\u201d and Rubblebucket\u2019s Alex Toth, who co-wrote the quirky and infectious \u201cDance Cardia.\u201d\n\nJust as Brooklyn has changed since the Pimps started, so has the band\u2019s sound.

Just being a person of color, a queer woman of color, for that matter, is freaking political. My focus, as far as this record, I guess it\u2019s really been psychological.

Not all of these tunes derive from this, which is why I say, \u2018both lived and imagined.' Some are love/sex/relationship-inspired, which in my opinion make the pain one might experience more bearable. In James Baldwin\u2019s essay, \u2018The Artist Struggle for Integrity,' he says, 'I tell you my pain so that I might relieve you of yours.'\"\n\n\n\nLight is a central character on Silhouette of Sirens. Even the title speaks to this push and pull between danger and safety, shadows and shiny lights, and the things we can reach out and touch as opposed to the things we only hear in the distance. \u201cWhat is even happening? One can only guess,\u201d Brown sings in the opening track \u201cDrive Slow,\u201d embracing an uncertainty and sense of wonder from the beginning of the record. By the third track, she\u2019s carrying us along with her on a journey inward. Like many masterful songwriters, she has the ability to make her stories feel intensely personal yet open-ended; even in \u201cCarried Away,\u201d it\u2019s hard to tell whether she\u2019s singing about a romantic rift, an abusive friendship, or the havoc that anxiety and depression can wreak on an unguarded mind. \" \u201cDon\u2019t leave me here all alone / For so long you\u2019ve been my light in the dark,\u201d Brown sings on the album\u2019s centerpiece, \u201cMy Stone,\u201d while the sexy, Prince-channeling acoustic funk jam \u201cWhisper\u201d beckons the listener to come closer, to dance with her in the dark, to \u201cwhisper in my ear all that you need.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about different types of heartbreak, and how one deals with it,\u201d Brown says of the album. \u201cAnd not the heartbreak of a coupled relationship; just living life, and the experiences that break your heart. There are these moments on the album where it\u2019s like, \u2018this is intense.' And then hopefully, there are moments where it\u2019s alleviated \u2014 as I feel like life is. Life is hard.

In bringing the album to life, vocalist/guitarist Joey Burns and drummer John Convertino found a spiritual home in unusual surroundings\u2014not in Arizona, but on the Northern California coast in a home-turned-studio called the Panoramic House. Built from debris and shipyard-salvaged timber\u2014and dubbed \u201cThe Phantom Ship\u201d by the band\u2014the grandiose house and its edge-of-the-world-like ambience soon made their way into the songs. The specter of California also had a powerful effect: as both dream state and nightmare, its infinite duality is mirrored in the music, giving Calexico a new direction and new edge. With less polish and more grit than ever before, The Thread That Keeps Us both honors enduring traditions and reveals Calexico\u2019s confidence in songwriting, ultimately setting a whole new standard for the band.\n\nAs heard on the album\u2019s lead single and opening track, the drama of the landscape directly impacted the making of The Thread That Keeps Us. Driven by sing-song melody and galloping rhythms, \u201cEnd of the World with You\u201d discovers an unlikely romanticism in volatile times. With its lyrics illuminating \u201cLove in the age of the extremes,\u201d the track is the perfect intro to an album that endlessly explores the contrast between bright and dark, hope and fear.\n\nWorking with their longtime engineer Craig Schumacher, Calexico co-produced The Thread That Keeps Us, gathering musicians from across the globe to dream up an earthy yet expansive sound spiked with jagged guitar tones and flashes of distortion. \u201cThere\u2019s a little more chaos and noise in the mix than what we\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d Burns points out. Although that chaos has much to do with \u201cwhere we\u2019re at right now as a planet,\u201d it also echoes Calexico\u2019s dedication to constant experimentation. \u201cWhenever we\u2019re writing and we come up with something that feels too familiar, someone will end up saying, \u2018That feels good, but let\u2019s keep going and see what else we can uncover,\u2019\u201d Burns says. \u201cIt\u2019s been really important to the arc of this band\u2019s evolution for us to always keep on trying new things.\u201d\n\nLike \u201cEnd of the World with You,\u201d much of The Thread That Keeps Us captures the anxieties and unease of living in tumultuous times. But while the album draws a kinetic energy from all that uncertainty, its lyrics unfold with a literary nuance and sense of setting and character. \u201cInstead of writing straight-up protest songs, I want to tell stories,\u201d Burns says. Largely inspired by his wanderings around Northern California during the album\u2019s production, the narratives embedded in The Thread That Keeps Us reflect on displacement, transitory existence, and\u2014in Burns\u2019s words\u2014\u201creturning to your home after being gone for some time and seeing how things have changed, and maybe not in the best way.\u201d\n\nAs the exact embodiment of that theme, \u201cThrown to the Wild\u201d delivers one of the most mesmerizing moments on The Thread That Keeps Us. With its gritty but poetic storytelling, the song opens on a downtown bus station late at night, its sleepy rhythms and atmospheric haze intensifying the bleakness of the scene (sample lyric: \u201cHome\u2019s waiting like a motherless child\u201d). From there, \u201cThrown to the Wild\u201d slips into a glorious frenzy of hummed harmonies, sprawling guitar lines, and Jacob Valenzuela\u2019s sorrowful trumpet playing, the effect both hypnotic and jarring. \u201cWe wanted the second part of the song to just open into this sea of chaos,\u201d says Burns, adding: \u201cSometimes chaos can be a good thing.\u201d\n\nEclectic in sound and feeling, The Thread That Keeps Us also offers the measured fury of \u201cBridge to Nowhere,\u201d the triumphant grooves of the Spanish-sung \u201cFlores y Tamales,\u201d the meditative rhythms and jangly guitar riffs of \u201cAnother Space.\u201d On \u201cThe Town & Miss Lorraine,\u201d shimmering tones and delicate mandolin melodies play against the darkly cinematic mood of the lyrics (\u201cSliding into the sea/With cynicism and rum/Watching Miss Lorraine/Smoking alone with the moon\u201d). The most brutal track on The Thread That Keeps Us, \u201cDead in the Water\u201d builds a thrilling menace from its snarling guitar riffs, frantic piano rhythms, and piercing lyrics penned for what Burns describes as \u201cthe antagonist to the story of the album\u2014a kind of monster\u201d (\u201cDon\u2019t try to look away or stop me in my path/I make the law and I decree a new kind of wrath\u201d). And woven throughout The Thread That Keeps Us are a series of instrumental interludes, including the lilting folk of \u201cUnconditional Waltz\u201d and the dreamy psychedelia of \u201cSpinball.\u201d \u201cGoing into making the album, the only thing I really knew for sure was that I wanted there to be moments that felt free and spontaneous\u2014just these moments of no time, no lyrics, no agenda,\u201d says Burns.\n\nOne of the most stirring tracks on The Thread That Keeps Us, \u201cGirl in the Forest\u201d spins a gentle fable from its near despair over the state of the planet (\u201cWell the world was spinning so fast, nobody took the time\u201d). \u201cThat song wouldn\u2019t have been written unless I was sitting next to my daughter Twyla, who was humming along as I was making up this melody,\u201d says Burns. \u201cFor months we tried finishing the lyrics together; I was leading with this idea about environmentalism and protesters in the forest, and I thought there could be some sort of spirit who appears. And then my daughter told me, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s cool\u2014but maybe it\u2019s just a girl who\u2019s friends with all the animals.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith \u201cGirl in the Forest,\u201d The Thread That Keeps Us displays a sensibility that\u2019s long informed Calexico\u2019s songwriting: a transcendentalist infatuation with the wild beauty of nature, a fascination deepened during their time at Panoramic House. \u201cBeing up there on the mountain and taking walks on the shore, and even swimming in the cold water, we couldn\u2019t help but be inspired by nature,\u201d says Convertino. \u201cOur love for our earth, our home, and the future of our children came into focus even more, giving the inspiration and desire to give back something that\u2019s positive and beautiful and life-affirming.\u201d\n\nIn that life-affirming spirit, Calexico decided to end The Thread That Keeps Us with a moment of fragile optimism. Described by Burns as \u201ca love song for my kids,\u201d the piano-laced, sweetly swaying \u201cMusic Box\u201d speaks to preserving dreams in a troubled reality. \u201cRight now we\u2019re at the edge of another potential crisis unfolding, and it\u2019s haunting every night as you put your kids to sleep,\u201d says Burns. \u201cBut at the same time, you look into a child\u2019s eyes and you see something hopeful, even if they\u2019ve maybe heard little pieces of what\u2019s going on in the news. I think that\u2019s pretty much the case with this band: we still have hope, and we\u2019re still so excited to be making this music together.\u201d\n\n\nCALEXICO ARE: Joey Burns, John Convertino, Martin Wenk, Jacob Valenzuela, Sergio Mendoza, Jairo Zavala Ruiz, and Scott Colberg.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8209458.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.46415, 37.77366], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Country, Rock, Folk", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Golden Gate Park"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "St. Paul and the Broken Bones", "ArtistBio": "Sea of Noise, the second full-length album by St. Paul and the Broken Bones, marks a quantum leap in sound and style for the high-voltage Birmingham, Alabama-based band.\n\nProduced by Paul Butler and recorded at Nashville\u2019s Sound Emporium, the group\u2019s sophomore effort features an expanded eight-piece lineup of the widely praised soul-based rock unit. Longtime members Paul Janeway (lead vocals), Jesse Phillips (bass, guitar), Browan Lollar (guitars), Andrew Lee (drums), Al Gamble (keyboards), and Allen Branstetter (trumpet) are joined by Jason Mingledorff (saxophone, clarinet, flute), and Chad Fisher (trombone).\n\nThe collection of new original songs is the group\u2019s first release on RECORDS, a joint venture of SONGS Publishing, winner of ASCAP\u2019s 2016 independent publisher of the year award, and veteran label executive Barry Weiss.\n\nSea of Noise is a successor to the Broken Bones\u2019 2013 debut album Half the City, which introduced the group\u2019s blazing mating of \u201860s soul fire \u2013 daubed with latter-day influences like Sly Stone, David Bowie, and Prince -- to Janeway\u2019s impassioned singing and writing. The new album witnesses a deepening and broadening of the unit\u2019s musical reach and lyrical concerns.\n\n\u201cIt felt like it happened organically,\u201d Janeway says of the band\u2019s development. \u201cWith the last record, it was like doing things with your hair on fire \u2013 going in, recording it live. There\u2019s a sense of urgency to having a record like that. We were only a band for about five months at that point. I didn\u2019t know my voice \u2013 I\u2019d never done this professionally. I was just learning more nuance, and about carrying a melody. You don\u2019t have to go for it 100% all the time. You can draw people in by giving and taking.\u201d\n\nJaneway says that he and his close musical associate Phillips began to ponder the direction of the band\u2019s second album a year and a half ago. \u201cIf we had been forced to go into a studio a year and a half ago, we probably would have done a better version of Half the City,\u201d he says. \u201cThere would have been nothing wrong with that. But we started evolving, or changing.\u201d\n\nWork began in earnest during last year\u2019s Coachella festival in California: \u201cWe rented a house in San Bernardino Valley National Park. The week in between the two weekends, we really started to hash things out. Then we rented out a very hot warehouse in Birmingham where we could write. And me and Jesse and a few of us would send stuff back and forth via Dropbox. That gave me the ability to work on harmonies on the vocals. I wanted to take it up a notch, in all realms.\u201d\n\nLooking to such inspirations as Tom Waits and Nick Cave, Janeway was intent on lifting his game as a songwriter on material for the second album. \u201cI\u2019m married to a woman with a masters in literature, and I can\u2019t show her lyrics unless I\u2019m pretty proud of \u2018em,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to sit and think about what I\u2019m saying \u2013 what do I want to say, is there anything to say? What\u2019s my perspective as this Southern kid who\u2019s watching the modern world and feeling very much like an alien in a lot of ways. This is more personal. If you\u2019re going to say something, say something, and don\u2019t waste your breath unless you feel like you\u2019re saying something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nJaneway adds that his reading of the book Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, played a role in the direction of the work: \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be an overly political record, but I feel it shows up a little bit on the album.\u201d\n\nWith a full complement of new songs in hand, St. Paul and the Broken Bones entered the studio with Butler, leader of the British band the Bees and producer of Devendra Banhart and Michael Kiwanuka.\n\n\u201cJesse was listening to one of his records and he said, \u2018Everything sounds great,\u2019\u201d Janeway recalls. \u201cIt sounded like a real record \u2013 everything had depth, and was expansive-sounding. Butler ended up being the guy that we wanted to use. Producer-wise, I think we knocked a home run. He is very meticulous.\u201d\n\nOn Sea of Noise, the band\u2019s brawny horn-driven sound is augmented \u2013 and displaced -- by the use of a string quartet and a vocal choir. The strings \u2013 recorded at Memphis\u2019 historic Sam Phillips Recording by engineer Jeff Powell \u2013 were arranged by Lester Snell, a veteran of Stax Records sessions by Isaac Hayes, Shirley Brown, Albert King, and the Staple Singers, among many others. Janeway says of Snell, \u201cHe did all these classic, great records in Memphis \u2013 he did the string arrangements on them. The strings, for us, supply a darker tone. Horns sometimes can\u2019t portray a certain darkness. We thought that would be the best option, instead of horn lines. We have songs on this record that don\u2019t have any horns at all.\u201d\n\nEmployed on \u201cCrumbling Light Posts,\u201d the recurring motif that appears three times on the album, Jason Clark and the Tennessee Mass Choir were recorded in another legendary Memphis facility. \u201cThe Stax Museum let us go in there after hours and record the choir,\u201d Janeway says, adding with a laugh. \u201cWe said, \u2018Well, hell, we\u2019re in Memphis, let\u2019s just see if they\u2019ll do it.\u2019 It was pretty neat, I\u2019m not gonna lie.\u201d\n\nHe says of the finished work, \u201cSea of Noise is not quite a full-blown concept record. It is focused in terms of subject matter \u2013 finding redemption and salvation and hope. \u2018Crumbling Light Posts\u2019 comes from an old Winston Churchill quote, in which he said England was a crumbling lighthouse in a sea of darkness. I always thought that was a really interesting concept \u2013 that we\u2019re falling anyway. In this day and age, it is the noise that has defined so many things. We\u2019re going to fall to it eventually, but for now we feel like our heads are above water. It felt anthemic.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s lyrical and emotional richness is heard loudly in stunning new compositions like \u201cBurning Rome\u201d (which Janeway describes as \u201ca letter to God, if I could write it\u201d) and the startling \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Woman,\u201d which knocks traditional soul music gender roles on their heads. Janeway says of the latter song, \u201cI wrote that with Jesse, and he said, \u2018If I can write that song, I can die a happy man, because I\u2019ve finally made something that I feel can stand up to my standards.\u2019\u201d\n\nSt. Paul and the Broken Bones, which toured extensively in the U.S. and Europe behind their debut album, will put their take-no-prisoners live show on the road this fall. Their most recent concert work included arena dates opening for the Rolling Stones in Atlanta and Buffalo. Some acts may have been daunted by such a task, but not this one.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty neat, it was pretty crazy,\u201d Janeway says. \u201cI love the Rolling Stones, but my train of thought it, you gotta try and blow \u2018em off the stage. And that\u2019s still my goal.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8757676.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, R&B, Rock n Roll", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "560 Broadway, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "The Bloozdogz", "ArtistBio": "Rodney Lee Castillo and Midnight train ,Now known as the Bloozdogz. we are a blues rock band performing songs written by Rodney Lee Castillo", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8428559.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.40676, 37.798204], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "The Bloozdogz at The Condor Club: The Condor Club is most famous as the place where stripper Carol Doda got her start in the '60s.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE.

He moved continuously until his teenage years, where he settled in Sonoma County. Presti played in a hardcore band, releasing several albums and touring extensively until they broke up.

Thile had set himself a formidable musical challenge and, as befits this enthusiastically risk-embracing artist, he was more than up to the task. In addition to traveling, planning, rehearsing, and performing on the fifteen episodes of APHC\u2019s 2016\u201317 season, Thile managed each week to create a funny, topical, and at times quite poignant new song he would play with a rotating cast of APHC band-mates and guest stars. These were not throwaway radio bits, but smart, fully realized compositions. They served the needs of the show but were just as timely and engaging on their own.\n\nIn July 2017, Thile went into New York City\u2019s Reservoir Studios with producer and longtime friend Thomas Bartlett and that\u2019s when these songs gained an even deeper resonance. As they listened through the APHC versions, Thile and Bartlett realized that, taken together, these songs could form an album-length narrative. Part of the story Thile found was autobiographical. Thanks for Listening represents perhaps the most direct and personal material Thile has ever recorded. It reflects the changes to his own peripatetic life as he assumes a new role as APHC host and, behind the scenes, as a new dad\u2014while continuing to play with his band Punch Brothers and collaborate with such artists as Brad Mehldau, Edgar Meyer, and Yo-Yo Ma. We learn what delights him (like the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series,) and what alarms him (the polarized state of our nation post-election). But Thile also tells a broader tale\u2014satirically, wistfully, frankly\u2014 about the divisions and disconnects plaguing America today, whether it\u2019s on social media or at the Thanksgiving table. The overarching theme, Thile realized, was about the art of listening\u2014the joys of it, the current difficulties of it, and the necessity of hearing what others have to say, not just the overwhelming desire to be heard.\n\nListening, or the lack thereof, figures prominently on several tracks: \u201cFeedback Loop\u201d lampoons the way social media filters out all but those one agrees with, while \u201cModern Friendship\u201d rues the way old pals can drift apart\u2014and suggests that maybe sharing a well-made night cap could help solve that. \u201cStanley Ann\u201d is a graceful imagining of what Barack Obama might have said to his late mom as he departed the White House in January. The deceptively cheerful \u201cFalsetto,\u201d on the other hand, is an all-too-kind speculation on how the current occupant of the White House might gracelessly scold an activist entertainer\u2014managing to insult the singer\u2019s \u201cgirly falsetto\u201d in the process.\n\n\u201cMy initial working title was Get It out on the Radio\u201d (the name of the song he performs at the end of each APHC episode). But the album pivoted away from the show and toward the listeners\u2014and not just to the listeners of Prairie Home but to anyone who listens to things. They are my heroes\u2014people who listen. I find myself all too often on the other side of the conversation, talking about what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s hard to maintain focus or give something enough attention to appreciate it. We\u2019re in a place where listening is a precious commodity. That\u2019s the theme that I noticed rising up, greater than \u2018here is what was happening last week\u2019 or \u2018here is the place we were.\u2019 It\u2019s a celebration of people who haven\u2019t switched off, despite being given every reason to do so.\u201d\n\nThe arrangements have an intimate, dream-like quality to them; the songs feel like reveries, not statements. Thile\u2019s voice is at times double- or triple-tracked, cossetted by subtle echo. He delivers vocal takes that are by turns wry and soulful, frequently deploying a lovely falsetto in an especially evocative way, more Beach Boys than bluegrass. The chorus of \u201cThank You, New York,\u201d performed with singer Gaby Moreno, is a vocal stand-out, a nose-thumbing good riddance to the turbulent year that was 2016 (and a nod to the resilience of New York City and its occupants). Thile\u2019s mandolin playing remains front and center\u2014and it the sole instrument on \u201cBalboa\u201d \u2014but it is often bolstered by Bartlett\u2019s subtle, slightly mysterious, layering of keyboards and electronics.\n\n\u201cI was deeply desirous of a record that sounded like it was coming from your own head. That\u2019s where we veered away from a more archival studio approach\u2014where you go in, perform the songs, and record exactly how those performances sounded,\u201d Thile says. \u201cThe recordings on Thank You for Listening are more fanciful in construction.\n\n\u201cOftentimes I would be at the big room of Reservoir Studios making maps of these songs with whatever stringed instruments seemed appropriate and singing scratch vocals. Then Thomas would take them into his little room and start experimenting on them. And I would start the next map,\u201d he continues. \u201cI would get my pass by having written the song and having created a keep-able demo of the song and then Thomas would get his pass without me looking over his shoulder, telling him \u2018that\u2019s not how it goes.\u2019 Which I\u2019m unable to not do if I\u2019m in the room. It was like an editor editing a novel.\u201d\n\nLike Thile, multi-instrumentalist Bartlett is a musical polymath, comfortable in diverse collaborative situations. He often sits in with the National; he plays piano in the Irish Music group The Gloaming; and he occasionally performs on his own under the Doveman moniker. Rather than enlisting a full APHC-style band in the studio, the pair conceived the project largely as a musical dialogue between them\u2014a listening session of their own, if you will.\n\nThile manned all the stringed instruments, save for bass (from Alan Hampton) and viola (from Nadia Sirota, on the title track). Ted Poor\u2014like Hampton, a member of Andrew Bird\u2019s touring band\u2014played drums on five tracks. Bartlett provided, in Thile\u2019s words, \u201cwhatever sounds weren\u2019t accounted for.\u201d Thile also invited three guest singers to the sessions, all of whom had performed multiple times on APHC: Sarah Jarosz, Gaby Mereno, and Aoife O\u2019 Donovan. He says, \u201cAll three had made really meaningful contributions to how the songs ended up expressing themselves. That goes for all the musicians who played on this last APHC season. They all made such meaningful contributions to these songs. I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d\n\nThe original \u201cSong of the Week\u201d versions can be easily accessed via YouTube, now that all the APHC shows are live-streamed and subsequently archived. The performances are full of personality and humor, as Thile, a dependably energetic live performer, interacts with a roster of players that include various Punch Brothers, brilliant guitarist Julian Lage, and Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek. Contrasting these versions with the new studio recordings, one can appreciate the sort of magical transformation that took place at Reservoir Studios, one that was more about inspiration than analysis.\n\nThe process effected a transformation on Thile too: \u201cBefore hosting Prairie Home, I would listen to music much the way an athlete trains. Listening was like hitting the gym, like a pitcher strengthening his rotator cuff. I was listening to improve specific aspects of my musicianship or nourish it in specific ways. The hosting has brought me back into being a music lover, just listening with the idea of enjoying the three to five minutes of a performance, not worrying about whether it\u2019s rendering my sense of counterpoint more sophisticated or increasing my knowledge of how sonata form works or giving me more arrows in my improvisational quiver.\u201d He continues, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u2018do I like this? Is my life better since listening to this song?\u2019 That\u2019s what I care about now.\n\n\u201cI think that development led me to ask Thomas to produce Thanks for Listening,\u201d Thile concludes. \u201cHe and I have stayed up late drinking Amaro and listening to records. I often hold vast amounts of myself back to analyze things and Thomas would consistently play me things that would disarm that side of me. I was yearning to make a set of music that maybe hits more of those marks, to have some of that rub off on me. I hope I succeeded with Thanks for Listening.\u201d\n\n\u2014Michael Hill", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8293069.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Bluegrass, Country", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "4117 Judah St, San Francisco, USA", "Artist": "Until Further Notice", "ArtistBio": "SF Bay Area based band, Until Further Notice was formed after long time friends Jack Schaefer and Dallas DeCarie started creating together in January of 2017.

That's the voice of Latin Grammy Award Nominee Andy Alemany.\n\nA native of Buffalo, NY and with well-established latin roots, his life was always tied to ministry. During his adolescence his parents were youth pastors and little by little he became involved in music and within his church. He was later given the opportunity to join SOG (Sounds of Glory), his first true band experience, which paved the way to becoming one of the most sought out background vocalist for different musical genre\u2019s and ministries.\n\nFor more than a decade he was part of Ricardo S\u00e1nchez's vocal team. A season where he grew as a worship leader and where he had the opportunity to share the stage and sing background vocals not only with Ricardo but with artists such as Israel Houghton, Kim Walker, Danny Gookey, Montell Jordan, Danilo Montero and Lucia Parker, among others.\n\nBy 2016, after months of strategic planning and working on his musical production, since going by the way of worship would have been the easiest, he decided to take his style to another level. A level where his songs could be accessible to all and empathically focus on his contemporary pop message of worship, something that goes beyond music. From His experiences is where his first single \u201cEres,\u201d was born. It was received with much enthusiasm in the Latin market. It positioned itself in the top rankings, which set the bar for his spanish EP \u201cTu Primero\u201d which was released in May of 2018.

Their 2015 release Haven (#1 Billboard Hard Rock) not only established a new generation of fans for the band, but also took the group to more countries and cities than ever.

The new album features all the signature elements of Kamelot but the band steps out to add new and industrial elements along with bringing some amazing emotions that harken to the band's earlier days. Kamelot\u2019s artsy music is chock full of symbolism relating to how the band feels about the world and the current state of civilization.\n\n\u201cThe Shadow Theory album is a psychological journey through the complexity of the Human Mind. We are subjected to stimuli constantly through media, technology, social experiments and AI. Can we still be social creatures in the near future?

In 2015, Margo Price was a country underdog just trying to keep enough gas in the tank to get to the next gig, but by the end of 2016, she was one of the genre's most celebrated new artists and a ubiquitous presence on late night television and at major festivals around the world. It's the kind of year most musicians can only dream of, and the arrival of Price's spectacular sophomore album, \"All American Made,\" proves that she hasn't taken a moment of it for granted. Delivering on the promise of her debut and then some, the record finds Price planting her flag firmly in the soil as a songwriter who's here for the long haul, one with the chops to hang with the greats she so often finds herself sharing stages with these days.\n\n\"People have started asking me, 'Now that you're having success, what are you going to write about?'\" Price recounts with a laugh. \"A lot of what I wrote on my debut came out of my struggles in the music business, but we don't have any shortage of material now. I'm just excited to finally have an audience and know that people are going to listen to our songs.\"\n\nA prolific writer with a knack for candid self-reflection, Price has never had to look too far for inspiration, and on 'All American Made,' she and her songwriting partner/husband, Jeremy Ivey, continue to depict the trials of everyday life with unflinching honesty, painting poetically plainspoken portraits of men and women just trying to get by. Highs and lows, long nights and hard days, wild women and cocaine cowboys, politics and sexism, it's all in there, singularly filtered through Price's wry, no-bullshit perspective. Throughout the album, her contemporary take on classic sounds is at once familiar and daring, an infectious blend of Nashville country, Memphis soul, and Texas twang that tips its cap to everyone from Waylon and Willie (who makes a guest appearance) to Loretta and Dolly, all while flipping a middle finger to the cookie-cutter pop that dominates modern country radio. Rich with swirling pedal steel, honky-tonk rhythms, and Price's stop-you-in-your-tracks vocals, 'All American Made' is deeply reverent of tradition even as it challenges conventions, a nuanced exploration of conflicted emotions for our deeply conflicted times.\n\nFar from overnight, Price's recent meteoric rise is the product of more than a decade of hard work and sacrifice. While she'd long been one of East Nashville's best-kept-secrets, she burst onto the international scene with the 2016 release of her first solo album, 'Midwest Farmer's Daughter.' The record debuted in the Top 10 on Billboard's Country Albums chart and graced Best-Of lists everywhere from Entertainment Weekly to NPR Music, who called it \"the hard-won arrival of an artist who feels like she's always been here.\" Vulture described Price as \"one of the most compelling country talents to come out of Nashville in recent memory,\" while Pitchfork hailed the album as \"a potential classic,\" and Rolling Stone praised its \"amazingly vivid songcraft.\" Price solidified her next-big-thing status with stellar performances on Saturday Night Live, Colbert, Fallon, CBS This Morning, Seth Meyers, A Prairie Home Companion, and more, in addition to taking home Emerging Artist of the Year honors at the Americana Music Awards and winning The American Music Prize for the year's best debut album. She shared stages and bills with Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, and Chris Stapleton among others, and her compelling story-years of toil in the Nashville trenches, the loss of her family's farm and the tragic death of her infant child, a brush with the law, selling her car and pawning her wedding ring to afford studio time, signing to Jack White's Third Man Records as the label's first country artist-was recounted in glowing profiles everywhere from the NY Times Magazine and the New Yorker to Morning Edition and Fader.\n\nWhen it was time to record the follow-up, Price and her band headed back to Memphis, TN, where they'd cut 'Midwest Farmer's Daughter' on a shoestring budget. Instead of returning to Sun Studios, though, they moved down the street to the larger Sam Phillips Recording studio, which the legendary producer opened in 1960 when his own skyrocketing success necessitated more space.\n\n\"We recorded live again because that's really how I like to work,\" Price explains. \"We'd get in around ten or eleven each morning, and then after about twelve hours of recording, we'd all start yelling for tequila, take a shot, and then just keep going.\"\n\nThat spirited, energetic atmosphere infuses even the record's darkest moments with a potent sense of vitality. On the uptempo album opener \"Don't Say It,\" Price dishes out sardonic wordplay over smoking hot guitar, while the pedal-steel and fiddle-fueled \"Weakness\" toes the line between sobriety and mayhem, and the tender \"Learning To Lose\" finds her living out a country music fantasy as she duets with Willie Nelson.\n\n\"We'd gotten to know him a bit from playing shows together and I idolized the hell out of him,\" says Price. \"I didn't know there were people like that, who'd achieved such massive stardom but remained so down to earth.\"\n\nOld school country may be the album's most obvious touchstone, but Price and her band incorporate 60's and 70's R&B into many of the arrangements here, fusing two of Tennessee's greatest musical exports. The funky \"Do Right By Me\" shimmies and grooves with Gospel legends The McCrary Sisters helping out on backing vocals, and the driving \"A Little Pain\" gets an assist from sweeping orchestration by Memphis legend Lester Snell (the man responsible for the string arrangements in \"Shaft\").\n\n\"Sometimes you feel like you've got to please everybody, but ultimately you should be the one you're worrying about taking care of,\" Price says of the inspiration behind the song. \"I wrote it pretty quickly just thinking about being on the road and trying to keep it together while you're burning the candle at both ends.\"\n\nThey say write what you know, and there are few things Price knows better than the road and the myriad of obstacles facing women who make their living on it. On \"Pay Gap,\" she laments the financial state of gender inequality (\"why don't you do the math? / Pay gap, pay gap / Ripping my dollar in half,\" she sings), and \"Wild Women\" looks at the hypocrisies of what's expected from male musicians compared to their female counterparts.\n\n\"There's a definite double standard,\" says Price, \"but I think if you're out there long enough, you stop giving any fucks and you just want to call it out. I get asked questions in interviews that no man would be asked, and if I'm assertive about what I want for me and my band, I get called a 'diva.' That song is really about the judgment I get from people who act like women shouldn't be out on the road. Girls should be encouraged to follow their careers and their dreams just as much as men.\"\n\nThe album closes with an intimate, acoustic rendition of \"All American Made,\" a song which calls to mind \"Born In The USA\" with its patriotic-sounding title and far more troubled lyrics.\n\n\"We actually wrote that song during the Obama administration,\" says Price, \"but it really altered meaning for me on the day Trump was elected. That song embodies the good and the bad in the ugly in this country. America is so beautiful to me, but it's in a really hard spot right now. I feel like I was one of the first and only country artists to speak out so openly against Trump, and I had a lot of people tell me I shouldn't be giving my opinion, but as far as I'm concerned, there's not a lot of doubt about the difference between right and wrong.\"\n\nThat candor is part of what makes 'All American Made' such a powerful follow-up release. Price could have taken her moment in the spotlight as an opportunity to homogenize and chase a slicker, more polished sound built for radio and arenas, but instead, she doubled down on the grit and the truth in her music. It's honesty that brought her to this remarkable moment, and honesty that will continue to carry her into the future. How much higher will Margo Price's star rise? Only time will tell, but just remember, a lot can change in a year.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/4582974.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.46415, 37.77366], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Modern Traditional Country", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Golden Gate Park"}, {"Address": "562 Sutter, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Curtain Call", "ArtistBio": "I Curtain Call sono una band pop/rock formata nell'estate del 2009 nata dall'esigenza di finalizzare le proprie esperienze musicali nella produzione di un lavoro discografico.

His signature sound is a rough-hewn, low-timbered rock and roll that nods to the likes of Jeff Buckley, Neil Young, and Joe Cocker, and is powered by Raffoul\u2019s gravelly, soulful voice and deeply felt lyrics. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing for me \u2014 a song needs to be about something I\u2019ve experienced or something someone close to me is going through,\u201d Raffoul says of his sources of inspiration. \u201cI find myself going back to moments of time from the past, picking apart these little experiences and building them into bigger things. I want people to know that the songs are genuine, that they've been lived in.\u201d \u201cDriver\u201d is one of those lived-in songs. It was inspired by his family picking up a hitchhiker one night after Raffoul and his musician father Jody played a gig on Pelee Island in the middle of Lake Erie. \u201cThis guy was really out of it, so he ended up staying with us for a few hours,\u201d Raffoul says. The following weekend Raffoul told his story of the hitchhiker to songwriter Simon Wilcox and songwriter-producer Nolan Lambroza during a writing session in Los Angeles. \u201cWe turned it into something a little more sentimental, in that maybe I\u2019m not singing about someone being lost on the side of the road, but maybe someone lost in life who doesn't know where they\u2019re going or what they\u2019re supposed to be doing,\u201d he explains. Raffoul has been fairly certain of what he wanted to do with his life from a young age. He grew up in a creative family in the small farming town of Leamington, Ontario \u2014 \u201cthe tomato capital of Canada,\u201d as he puts it. His mother is an artist, writer, and teacher and his father Jody Raffoul is a solo artist and hometown hero who has opened for everyone from Joe Cocker to Bon Jovi. Raffoul\u2019s earliest musical influences come from his dad. \u201cThe Beatles were like Jesus in our house,\u201d he recalls, adding that he also listened to soul singers like Otis Redding and Sam Cooke. On his tenth birthday, Billy received a \u2018British Invasion\u2019-inspired guitar with a Union Jack on its front from Jody and started teaching himself to play. By 16, had bought his first real guitar \u2014 a 1968 Gibson Les Paul Black Beauty. \u201cIt\u2019s the same model and year as the only one Jimi Hendrix was ever photographed playing,\u201d Raffoul says. When Raffoul was in high school, he watched his dad headline a show for 4,000 people at his school\u2019s stadium. \u201cI remember in that moment thinking, \u2018This is cool,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI had appreciated music and written songs up until then, but I didn't think I wanted to be a live performer until that one show.\u201d Raffoul\u2019s first paying gig was playing to long-haul drivers at a local truck stop. \u201cFor the next three or four years I just put everything into it, playing out four and five nights a week in bars from Leamington to Detroit and back.\u201d Every so often Raffoul would get a gig singing demos for hire. \u201cJust getting paid hourly to be the vocalist,\u201d he explains. \u201cOne day I went into the studio to sing on some Kid Rock demos. The guys heard my voice in the booth and asked if I had any original stuff. I played them two acoustic songs. They shot an iPhone video and sent it to my now-manager, who used to work with Kid Rock. The next day we drove down to Nashville.\u201d Raffoul now splits his time between Nashville and Los Angeles where, in between playing shows, he has been collaborating with other songwriters and slowly but surely assembling his debut album. \u201cSince it\u2019s my first record it feels like I\u2019ve been writing it my whole life,\u201d he jokes. In addition to \u201cDriver,\u201d Raffoul is proud of another new song called \u201cI\u2019m Not A Saint,\u201d which emerged from a conversation Raffoul had with his co-writer Julia Michaels. \u201cWe were talking about things we do or that we shouldn\u2019t do, like swear too much, smoke too much, lie too much, and it just flowed from there,\u201d Raffoul says. \u201cForty-five minutes later it was done.\u201d As he gears up to finish his debut album, Raffoul is also eager to tour and see the world. \u201cI\u2019m putting everything into this record,\" he says, \"but I want to build my career on the live show. I want to be a true working musician.\" He knows that makes him sound like a traditionalist and he's fine with that. \"It\u2019s more of the old school way of doing things,\" he says. \"But I think that even in this ever-changing music business there will always be a thirst for live performance and that\u2019s what I want to do.

Brown had already made a name for herself prior to that by performing extensively with fiddler Stuart Duncan, and on occasional pick-up sessions with artists such as Vince Gill, Byron Berline and John Hickman.\n\nIn the summer of 1978, she traveled the country with Duncan and his father, playing festivals and contests.

Since its inception Compass Records Group (the subject of both Harvard Business School and Darden Business School case studies) has pursued an ambitious path of growth and met every goal including the most important one: providing a thriving haven of creativity for artists and a reliable beacon of quality for music fans.\n\nBrown tours internationally with the Alison Brown Quartet, was personally requested to play at the 2007 inauguration of Harvard\u2019 first female president, Drew Faust, and was the 2007 recipient of Irish America Magazine\u2019s \u201cStars of the South Award\u201d for Compass Records\u2019 efforts towards the \u201ccultivation and preservation of Irish music.\u201d Brown\u2019s discography includes four releases on Vanguard Records as well as six on the Compass Records label, including The Company You Keep (March 2009).", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9001979.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.06325, 37.257026], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Bluegrass, Acoustic, Newgrass, Country, Folk, Jazz", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Mountain Winery"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "Rob Ickes and Trey Hensley", "ArtistBio": "This unique collaborative effort between two uniquely gifted musicians is bound to be a revelation to traditional music fans on several counts. Rob Ickes is a longtime, well-established instrumental giant, and Trey Hensley is newly arrived in Music City, bursting with talent both as a vocalist and guitarist. Their new album, Before the Sun Goes Down, is slated for release this winter. From his powerful yet sympathetic vocal interpretations of traditional and contemporary material to his jaw-dropping instrumental skills on both acoustic and electric guitar and considerable songwriting talents, Trey Hensley is bursting at the seams with freshness and musical excitement. His resonant baritone voice is rich, expressive, and equally at ease with classic bluegrass, traditional country, and original compositions. Raised in Jonesborough, Tennessee, Trey began playing guitar and singing when he was 10 years old. Invited by Marty Stuart and joined from the wings by Earl Scruggs, Trey Hensley landed on the Grand Old Opry when he was only 11. To this day, Marty Stuart remains a fan and booster. Trey has already in his young life played with Johnny and June Carter Cash, Charlie Daniels, Ricky Skaggs, Steve Wariner, The Oak Ridge Boys ,and Janie Fricke. He\u2019s appeared on bills with Sara Evans , Charlie Daniels, Peter Frampton, Randy Owen, Steve Wariner, and Marty Stuart, and has appeared before President George W. Bush, First Lady Barbara Bush and Vice President Cheney. Rob Ickes has been playing bluegrass with his much-decorated band Blue Highway for over twenty years, during which time he has been adjudged Bluegrass Dobro Player Of the year fifteen times. Rob has played on countless sessions, recording with artists such as Merle Haggard, Dierks Bentley, Patty Loveless, and Alison Krauss. He has also helped form a jazz \u2013oriented trio, Three Ring Circle, along with Andy Leftwich and Dave Pomeroy. His most recent album Three Bells is a true dobro summit, collaborating with fellow greats Jerry Douglas and the late Mike Auldridge. He even once received a surprise phone call from admirer, jazz guitar and harmonica master Toots Thielemans! In Before the Sun Goes Down, the listener will have the chance to view Rob Ickes, by now an acknowledged master of the dobro and lap steel guitar, outside of the box. Rob has been a supporter since he first heard Trey, a happening that came about in an unusual way. He became aware of the young man\u2019s enormous vocal talent when he heard his scratch vocal (suggested by the album\u2019s engineer) on Rob\u2019s band Blue Highway\u2019s album The Game. Wayne Taylor and Tim Stafford of Blue Highway penned the song \u201cMy Last Day In The Mine.\u201d The band had initially hoped to have a prominent lead singer outside the band to perform a guest vocal of the song for the album but found themselves falling in love with the youthful Trey\u2019s evocation of the world-weary working man\u2019s fears of leaving the only job he\u2019d ever known. Trey was 22 at the time. Trey\u2019s vocal was used on the completed product and has since received considerable positive notice, as has the entire album. Shortly thereafter, Trey and his wife Amber relocated to Nashville, and Rob has been showing Trey the ropes. Before the Sun Goes Down promises to be a breath of fresh air on the country music scene today while bringing traditional country and bluegrass music to the forefront. Accompanied by some of the finest, most accomplished musicians in Nashville , Rob and Trey tackle a diverse group of songs, put a fresh spin on some old ones, polish up some more recent hits, and offer up an original from Trey \u2013 all the while drawing influence from artists as diverse as Jimmy Martin, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Billy Joe Shaver, Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt & Earl Scruggs, Buddy Emmons, Jimmie Rodgers, and Bob Wills. In addition to Rob, Trey\u2019s sterling vocals are bolstered by a band which includes Aubrey Haynie or Andy Leftwich on fiddle, the ubiquitous (and mighty fine) Nashville acoustic bassist Mike Bub, and drummer John Gardner. Others featured are Jon Randall, Susanne Cox, Dan Tyminski, Shawn Lane, and Ron Block. Before the Sun Goes Down was recorded mostly live with minimal overdubs, fixes, punch-ins, or even very many takes, and with all the musicians in one room in only a few days of studio time. Rob, the driving force behind the album and the man largely responsible for its creation, says that his favorite albums by the pioneers of the music, the ones that made him want to make music in the first place, were made in the same manner. The spontaneity and sheer joy of creation among a small group of master musicians is palpable in listening to the completed product.

In the best of all possible worlds, it would be heard in an acoustically perfect concert hall by an audiencethat sits undistracted in the dark listening intently to itsexquisitely sculpted lyrics, transcendent melodies and intricately woven instrumentation. But it\u2019ll work just fine in your car stereo, too.\n\nLowrey is a former member of and opening act for the Zac Brown Band and co-writer of the ZBB hits, \u201cColder Weather\u201d and \u201cThe Wind.\u201d\n\nThe Roots of the album\u2019s title refers to 11 songs made famous in the late 1920s and early \u201830s by Lowrey\u2019s great-great grandfather, fiddler Gid Tanner and members his celebrated band, the Skillet Lickers. During that era, Tanner eclipsed or stood shoulder-to-shoulder in popularity with the now legendary Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers. In reviving these classics, Lowrey\u2014a commanding fiddler and guitarist in his own right\u2014is backed by the current edition of the Skillet Lickers, a self-regenerating assemblage of virtuosi that includes Phil Tanner, Russ Tanner, Fleet Stanley, Larry Nash and Joel Aderhold.\n\nThe Branches disc spotlights Lowrey\u2019s astounding skillsas a singer, songwriter, instrumentalist, bandleader and producer. Of the 10 songs here, the Dacula, Georgia nativewrote or co-wrote eight, each a cinematically luminous glimpse of adult life. \u201cI try to make my lyrics as relatable as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m one man going through my own set of failures and successes, my own story. But the core of these emotions are experienced by everyone. I\u2019m not afraid of being human.\u201d\n\nThat humanity is forged and tempered in what one song calls \u201cthe side effects of living.\u201d And, thus, we hear in Lowrey\u2019s lyrics meditations on fate, regrets, guilt (both personal and cosmic), self-effacement, world-weariness, immortality, restlessness and the magnetic lure of home. If that sounds like too heavy an agenda for mere music, fear not\u2014Lowrey leads us through these emotional rough spots with a savior\u2019s touch.\n\nIn Lowrey\u2019s universe, music and a sense of community are inseparable. He recalls his grandparents taking him to jam sessions every Friday night at the \u201cChicken House\u201d on GidTanner\u2019s farm. It was just that\u2014a converted chicken house\u2014in which local musicians gathered for joy, relief and companionship.\n\n\u201cThat was the beginning of music,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore you had records being sold and the commercialization of music, it was primarily a get-together. That was the reason for it. It always belonged in a community. I feel we\u2019ve lost sight of that. Now it\u2019s about record sales and touring and concerts and things of that nature. I don\u2019t get quite as much fulfillment from that as I do sitting around on the front porch playing with a bunch of guys.\u201d\n\nIn the sixth grade, Lowrey began taking classical violin lessons and soon moved on to playing fiddle music, taking in and assimilating all the instrumental techniques and flourishes he saw on display at the Chicken House. Even so, he stayed in the school orchestra throughout high school. In his sophomore year, he joined a rock band, playing lead guitar, and performing at fairs and clubs in Atlanta, Athens and the surrounding areas.\n\n\u201cWe never really did anything big, never really got anywhere with it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just enjoyed it. It was some of the best times I ever had playing music.\u201d\n\nHis next move was to join Sonia Leigh\u2019s band as a fiddler. \u201cAll the while I was writing my own stuff,\u201d he recalls, \u201ccoming up with my own voice and kind of figuring out what I had to say. About two years after I went withSonia, I started playing out on my own and doing my own thing a lot more. I eventually decided to make music my full time profession. I was working construction at the time as a framer. So I quit my job and played just as much as I possibly could. I think one year\u2014between my gigs and hers\u2014we did over 285 shows. It was the only way we could make any money. You just kind of went up there and busted your ass, maybe for $25 bucks, especially in Athens. In some joints you got paid your bar tab.\u201d\n\nAfter touring with Leigh for years, Lowrey found himself playing on the same bill with Zac Brown at the Dixie Tavern in Marietta, Georgia. \u201cZac\u2019s star was rising and he ended up forming a record label,\u201d Lowrey says. \u201cSonia and I both signed to it on the same day. About then, Sonia and I went our separate ways. With my obligations as a recording artist, I couldn\u2019t play with her fulltime. I hit the road with Zac and toured with him for several years. And I wrote a bunch of good songs with him. When the label folded, I went completely independent and put out My Crazy Head in 2015. Roots and Branches is my second independent release.\u201d\n\nIt was while touring with Brown that Lowrey realized it was time to choose what he wanted to achieve with his music. He and Brown were sitting on the bus before a show \u201ceither in Greenville, South Carolina or Greensboro, North Carolina\u201d when Brown asked the crucial question. \u201cZac said, \u2018Do you want to be me\u2014to follow this path that I\u2019m on [to stardom]\u2014or do you want to be Darrell Scott?\u2019 Darrell Scott\u2019s my heroin that he found something to say and a voice to say it with and the determination to control what he will and won\u2019t do. And I chose then and still choose to this day \u2018to be\u2019 Darrell Scott.\u201d\n\nBut he loved the songwriting that came from his time with Brown. \u201cWe were writing all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cZac used to write almost every night. Everybody who was on that tour wrote a bunch of songs. We had a joke that the ones who could stay up the longest were the ones who got the songwriting credit. We all contributed so much.\u201d\n\nBeing the heir to a distinguished musical dynasty hasn\u2019t been all that intimidating, Lowrey says. \u201cFirst of all, the family is not as well known as you\u2019d think it is or it should be. The only time I feel pressure is when I get around people who know more about Gid Tanner than I do.\u201d That happened earlier this year when Lowrey was invited to perform at the International Country Music Conference in Nashville. Made up of scholars and country music enthusiasts to whom the name \u201cGid Tanner\u201d is magical, the conference welcomed Lowrey like a celebrity, rushing out afterward to buy his albums and ask for autographs and pictures. It was a display of affection and respect Darrell Scott might have envied.\n\nAs it turns out, Lowrey\u2019s musical role model isn\u2019t GidTanner, but rather his son, Gordon. \u201cHe passed away before I was born,\u201d Lowrey says, \u201cbut I used to sit down and listen to old tapes of him playing fiddle for hours on end and try to copy everything he did. So the way I play \u2018Down Yonder\u2019 or \u2018Listen To The Mocking Bird\u2019 or \u2018The Old Spinning Wheel\u2019 or \u2018Out Of My Bandage\u2019\u2014that\u2019s all from Gordon. For my two cents, there was no better fiddle player in that family.\u201d\n\nThese days, Lowrey plays a lot of listening rooms and house concerts, venues where he can get to know his audiences by face and name and be invited back. \u201cI\u2019m never tried to be any kind of superstar who disappears right before or right after the show. I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s going to hang out with you all night long.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8379591.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-79.6665, 43.4474], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Songwriter, Singer", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Oakville, CA"}, {"Address": "3038 Fulton St., San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Emmylou Harris", "ArtistBio": "With a career that has sold more than 15 million albums worldwide, garnered a remarkable 12 Grammy Awards and stirred music lovers for more than thirty years and counting, Emmylou Harris has been rightfully hailed as a major figure in several of America\u2019s most important musical movements of the past three decades. A steadfast supporter of roots music and a skilled interpreter of compelling songs, she also has been associated with a diverse and dazzling array of admiring collaborators from Bright Eyes to Tammy Wynette and from Neil Young to Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash. The songbird\u2019s contributions to country-rock, the bluegrass revival, folk music, and the Americana movement are widely lauded, and in recent years Emmylou Harris certainly has carved out a sound that is uniquely her own. Her 1995 Wrecking Ball was a watershed album for her, combining several world-music elements with acoustic instruments, driving percussion, and a folk/roots flavor, and in general catching audiences by surprise, as Harris yet again reinvented her sound. The new style would evolve on a number of Harris\u2019 subsequent releases, including 1998\u2019s Spyboy, 1999\u2019s Western Wall (a collaboration with Linda Ronstadt), 2000\u2019s Red Dirt Girl and 2003\u2019s Stumble into Grace. Harris took up guitar as a teenager inspired by the folk music of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger and Judy Collins. Starving-artist stints in New York City and Nashville led to regular club work in Washington D.C. where Chris Hillman first saw Emmylou perform. Hillman and country-rock visionary Gram Parsons had been band mates in The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers, but now Gram was on his own doing solo material, and had told his former band mate he was looking for \u201ca chick singer\u201d for his first solo record. Hillman had seen Harris perform at a club in DC and told Parsons about Emmylou, but neither gentleman knew how to get in touch with her until a chance encounter between Harris\u2019 babysitter, Hillman and Parsons led to Emmylou on a plane to Los Angeles in 1972 to sing on Parsons\u2019 first record.

The album electrified the country-music world, becoming the first in a series of annual gold or platinum albums through the \u201870s. Her next 3 releases (Elite Hotel, Luxury Liner and Quarter Moon in a Ten-Cent Town) made her an unquestioned country-rock leader, and since then Emmylou Harris has been regarded as a key figure in the movement that united rock audiences with country traditionalists. She made country music \u201chip\u201d and brought it to a vast youth market for the first time. Then she led the way back to neo-traditionalist sounds with 1979\u2019s Blue Kentucky Girl. The following year\u2019s Roses In the Snow paved the road toward the bluegrass revival during the \u201880s \u2013 an era of urban cowboys and country-pop. Emmylou rose to become the authentic voice of country with these albums, as well as Evangeline, Cimarron and Bluebird. By the early 1990s Harris changed her sound again with the acoustic band The Nash Ramblers and honored one of country music\u2019s most legendary concert halls with the Grammy-winning Live at the Ryman CD of 1992. Just three years later, Emmylou took a leading role in yet another musical revolution\u2014the Americana movement that gave country music its \u201calternative\u201d wing. Continuing to expand boundaries, this time Emmylou paired with producer Daniel Lanois and reinvented her sound for her 1995 watershed album, Wrecking Ball, for which she earned another Grammy award. The album was hailed by critics as a masterpiece and portrayed a new side of Emmylou \u2013 spiritual yet sexual, and a woman with very eclectic tastes. She followed Wrecking Ball with the live album Spyboy and closed the decade with a powerful album of duets with Linda Ronstadt, Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions. With 2000\u2019s Red Dirt Girl, Emmylou released the first album of her career that was nearly entirely comprised of Harris-penned songs. The album, and its follow-up, 2003\u2019s Stumble Into Grace, revealed a remarkable songwriting talent in Emmylou Harris, and further demonstrated Harris\u2019 diverse musical influences, mixing world music instrumentation and rock rhythms into her country and folk confidence and verve.

And so are the stories in between them. She is a captivating storyteller, with a twinkle in her eye that makes everyone in the audience think she is sharing a secret with them alone. Emotionally fearless, she shares her deepest sorrows with a rare vulnerability and tenderness one moment, then a quick wit and an outlandish, irreverent sense of humor the next.\n\nAs a salaried staff songwriter on Nashville\u2019s Music Row, Nygaard learned her craft well. Her last CD \u201cLet The Storm Roll In\u201d rose to #1 on the Cashbox Roots/Country chart and #8 on the Folk DJ chart. Two of the songs, \u201cGeorgia Boy\u201d and \u201cJ.C.\u201d won the Kerrville, TX Folk Festival \u201cNew Folk\u201d songwriting competition for her, but they weren\u2019t the only songs that radio took a liking to. EVERY song on the album received airplay. \u201cStorm\u201d was also highly praised by the press. It received five stars from Americana benchmark magazine \u201cMaverick\u201d, and legendary folk music magazine \u201cSing Out\u201d claimed the songs \u201crival the likes of Guy Clark or Ian Tyson\u201d.\n\nNygaard is now poised to release her newest album \"Lucky Girl\". Produced by Grammy nominated Neilson Hubbard, this album contains songs that are a rollercoaster of human emotions. From the storytelling title cut which won the Tumbleweed Music Fesitival songwriting competition, to the honesty of raw and open wounds in \"Me Too\" and \"I Wonder\", to the flirty and seductive \"Tumblin Down\" and \"Embarassed\", and the sassy \"Or Not\" and \"Stitches\", her songwriting is fresh, imaginative, and insightful.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9140758.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.5889, 37.9871], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Country, Folk", "OtherInfo": "1 block from the adorable town of Fairfax in Marin County.

This fourteen track album follows a recent run of hugely acclaimed albums (Roll With The Punches, Versatile and You\u2019re Driving Me Crazy), each of which has delved deep into the musical styles that have continued to inspire Van throughout his life \u2013 vocal jazz and R&B.

Alongside these reinterpretations, The Prophet Speaks features six phenomenal new Van Morrison compositions.\n\nVan Morrison says of The Prophet Speaks: \u201cIt was important for me to get back to recording new music as well as doing some of the blues material that has inspired me from the beginning. Writing songs and making music is what I do, and working with great musicians makes it all the more enjoyable.\u201d\n\nThe Prophet Speaks again finds Van working with the incredible multi-instrumentalist Joey DeFrancesco (the artist co-credited on You\u2019re Driving Me Crazy) and his band (including Dan Wilson on guitar, Michael Ode on drums and Troy Roberts on tenor saxophone).\n\nThe title track from The Prophet Speaks is available now as an instant grat \u2013 listen here.

Their first name was Tricky Beans.\nAfter some line-up changes in 1997, they changed their name to Tricky Means. In 1999 the band recorded the new demo \u201cFull Moon\u201d in the Tico Tico Studios in Kemi.\n\nThis new demo was the first survey for the band in heavy metal waters. The trade marks of the band were a faster and melodical sound, keyboard oriented heavy metal with clear and high vocals. How the destiny wanted it, and with help from Athi Kortelainen and the Tico Tico Studios, the demo \u201cFull Moon\u201d found the way to the metal label Spinfarm. Meanwhile Tricky Means changed the name to Sonata Arctica.\n\n\nIn summer 1999 the first single \u201cUnOpened\u201d was released. The release of the first real full legend album \u201cEcliptica\u201d designated the fall 1999. At first it was only sold in Finland, but other countries were soon to follow. Shortly after this release Tony Kakko decided to concentrate more on singing, as opposed to trying to sing and play keyboards at the same time. Mikko H\u00e4rkin (ex-Kenziner) became a new member and replaced Tony on the keyboard.\n\nAfter the last show of the Silence tour at J\u00f6risrock in 2002, Mikko H\u00e4rkin decided to leave the band because of personal matters. The band announced the search for a new keyboarder and got a lot of applications from all over the world. After a night in a bar with the two candidates that had been invited, the band voted for Henrik Klingenberg.\n\nThe national success continued after \"Winterheart's Guild\" was released in Finland. It entered the charts on the 3rd place and stayed in the top 10 for five weeks.\n\nAfter this, Sonata Arctica signed a contract with Nuclear Blast.\n\nThe recording session for the next album now also featured Henrik who added fresh spices to the soup, later on called \"Reckoning Night\". In Finland the album came up to the second position for the most sold exemplars in the first two weeks. Finland wasn\u2019t the only country, where \u201cReckoning Night\u201d stayed in the charts. In Germany it was on place 77, in Switzerland on place 85 and in Norway on place 69. In fact, there should follow a headliner tour after the release, but the band got the unique bargain to play with Nightwish on their European tour as special guest. The band decided to do so and thus they toured with Nightwish through all over Europe and played in arenas with capacities up to 12 000 people!\n\nIn October 2004 the band received remarkable news: They would exceeded the Gold record because of their album \u201cSilence\u201d, which arrived a sale of more than 15.000 copies and finally became to the most sold albums of the band.\n\nThe last gig on this tour was at the newly-formed Finnish Metal Expo at Kaapelitehdas, Helsinki.. The last show of the Finnish tour wasn\u2019t only a sold out performance with an enormous audience, it was also a good practise for the band for the coming Japan tour. For the first time, Sonata Arctica had played the same set which would be later released as their first DVD \u201cFor The Sake Of Revenge\u201d, it was recorded in Tokyo.\n\nThe Japanese label Marquee/ Avalon released the compilation album \u201cThe End Of This Chapter\u201d. The composition contained a previously unreleased version, an instrumental issue of \u201cDraw Me\u201d of the album \u201cWinterheart\u2019s Guild\u201d. The first limited pressing of the compilation was arranged with a DVD, which contains seven acoustic songs.\n\nIn the second half of December 2005, once again the magic of Sonata Arctica was showed: Their third album \u201cWinterheart\u2019s Guild\u201d received the gold disc, because more than 15.000 copies were sold before the beginning of 2006. Once again the have captured Finland and for the second time they gained the once-in-a-lifetime goal during one month.\n\nShortly after \u201cWinterheart\u2019s Guild\u201d, the fourth studio album \u201cReckoning Night\u201d was also awarded with the golden disc in Finland, while the band still toured through North America in February 2006. More than 100.000 copies of this album were sold worldwide. In a little while after the end of the North American tour in February, Sonata Arctica started a Europe tour to promote their forthcoming live DVD \"For The Sake Of Revenge\".\n\nWhile the band recorded the fifth album \u201cUnia\u201d in different studios, the Finnish press announced an official documentary film about Sonata Arctica. This documentary followed Sonata Arctica in their hometown Kemi and also showed how a song of Sonata Arctica is developing from the scratch to the very end of the creative process. Meanwhile this documentary isn\u2019t the only non-musical work in combination with Sonata Arctica, there was also a Sonata Arctica 3d role playing game for PC, with the name \u201cWinterheart\u2019s Guild\u201d, developed.\n\nIn May 2007 the album \u201cUnia\u201d was released. Before the release of the album, the single \u201cPaid In Full\u201d was released in Finland, Japan and Germany. This single got the first place in the official Finnish charts, the second place in the following week and stayed in the national top ten, till the release of \u201cUnia\u201d, a month later.\n\nAfter 17 years as a team, the wolf pack has moved from classic Power Metal to more progressive shores, but went back to their initial roots on the last release 'Pariah\u2019s Child. Fans know that SONATA ARCTICA constantly deliver their high quality sound, but are also up for a little surprise here and there, hence every one of the band\u2019s 8 full-length releases carried its own charm that always added a fresh new touch to the genre.\n\nTherefore the ever-active quintet rarely finds time to breathe and once again, it only took them less than two years to produce the follow-up to their last hit album - their new brainchild The Ninth Hour will see the light of day on October 2016. But just like their last two releases, this album also gives the listener food for thought due to its thoughtful lyrical and visual content. After a North American tour plus many headline shows around the globe, the band was able to take a close look at the entire world as it is at the moment \u2013 on the edge of a possible armageddon.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9372199.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.448345, 37.802902], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Power Metal", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Palace of Fine Arts Theatre"}, {"Address": "1300 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Palisades", "ArtistBio": "In 1996 Sonata Arctica was formed in the northern Finland city Kemi.

But we\u2019re the new kids in the neighborhood in America at the same time.\u201d\nAvatar came of age as \u201clittle brothers\u201d of sorts of the famed Gothenburg scene that spawned the celebrated New Wave Of Swedish Death Metal. The band\u2019s debut album, 2006\u2019s Thoughts of No Tomorrow, was filled with brutal, technical melodic death metal to be sure but already, \u201cWe tried to put our own stamp on it,\u201d the singer assures. While the following year\u2019s Schlacht still contained flourishes of melody, the unrelenting metallic fury reached an extreme peak. \u201cIntensity was very important,\u201d he says, with some degree of understatement.\nWhere to go for album number three? \u201cWe basically rebelled against ourselves,\u201d Eckerstr\u00f6m says of 2009\u2019s self-titled collection. \u201cWe figured, \u2018We can play faster and make even weirder, more technical riffs,\u2019 because Schlacht was cool. But to take that another step would have turned us into something we didn\u2019t want to be.\u201d\nInstead Avatar rediscovered their inherent passion for traditional heavy metal and classic rock n\u2019 roll. \u201cWe decided to remove some unnecessary \u2018look at me, I can play!\u2019 parts and added more groove. We added a whole new kind of melody. It was awesome to be this \u2018rock n\u2019 roll band\u2019 for a while. It was refreshing and liberating.\u201d\nBlack Waltz sees Avatar coming completely full circle, returning to a more aggressive form of heavy metal but incorporating the lessons they learned while jamming on big riffs with album number three. \u201cWe finally came to understand what a good groove is all about and what a great fit it was for our sound,\u201d notes Eckerstr\u00f6m.\nTracks like the appropriately titled \u201cReady for the Ride,\u201d the rollicking \u201cLet it Burn\u201d (which dips into some delicious stonerifficness), the anthemic \u201cSmells Like a Freakshow\u201d (a modern day twist of Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie) and \u201cTorn Apart\u201d are supercharged with a dynamic range of artistic showmanship on a near cinematic scale and it\u2019s all stitched together by a driving bottom end.\nWhile most European metal acts who dare attempt this level of musicianship, showmanship and attention to detail seem content to toil away in the studio and lock themselves away from the crowds, Avatar have excelled beyond their peers thanks in large part to their continued focus on road work. Careening to and fro on tour busses and airplanes around the world like a marauding troupe of circus performers, Eckerstr\u00f6m and his mates (guitarists Jonas Jarlsby and Tim \u00d6hrstr\u00f6m, bassist Henrik Sandelin and drummer John Alfredsson) have forged the type of musical bond that can only be brought forth from massive amounts of time spent together on the stage, in hotel rooms, in airports and partying at the venue\u2019s bar.\nWhether on tour with bands like In Flames, Dark Tranquility or Helloween, playing gigantic festivals like Storsj\u00f6yra and Sweden Rock Festival or demolishing South by Southwest, playing live is what it all comes down to for this band. \u201cThat is the final manifestation of our art,\u201d Eckerstr\u00f6m insists. \u201cOf course an album is a piece of art in itself, but mainly it's a means to reach the higher goal, which is doing these awesome shows. Touring is of the greatest importance.\u201d\n\u201cWe all just love the pirate\u2019s life,\u201d he admits freely. \u201cSailing into the city on this tour bus thingy, going to kick some ass, have that party and all the while meeting all of these people, entertaining them, encountering a culture that's not your own. We love that.\u201d\nThe want for this type of lifestyle goes back to early childhood fascinations for the good-humored singer. Reading about superheroes, watching Hulk Hogan on TV, getting exposed to Kiss \u2013 these were the first ingredients for what Eckerstr\u00f6m would go on to create with the guys in Avatar and what has culminated now in Black Waltz.\nThe frontman promises that Avatar will continue to create, to captivate and to experiment. There\u2019s no definitive endpoint in sight. It\u2019s always about the horizon, the journey itself. \u201cAs long as you're hungry as an artist, there are higher and higher artistic achievements. I love AC/DC and Motorhead and what they\u2019ve established is amazing, but we don\u2019t want to write albums that are kind of like the album before. We want to travel to a new galaxy, so to speak, every time.\u201d\nThe goal is always to conquer what came before. \u201cThat is what stays with you as a mentally healthy musician. Or maybe a mentally deranged one, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d the singer laughs. And part and parcel to that continued evolution will be the ever broadening expansion of the scope of Avatar\u2019s worldwide presentation: Black Waltz and beyond.\n\u201cWe have great visions of what we want to do and the things we want to give to people on a stage,\u201d Eckerstr\u00f6m promises. \u201cThese ideas, these visions, they require a huge audience. They require a lot of legroom to be done, so I want to get into those arenas, basically. I know we would do something really magical if we got the chance. This idea is one of those things that really, really keeps us going.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8239396.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4088, 37.78345], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Metal, Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Warfield"}, {"Address": "400 S 1st St, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Urban Pioneers", "ArtistBio": "Mix one part Texas fiddle and one part Tennessee banjo, add doghouse bass and a splash of guitar and you have a delicious cocktail for your ears known as the Urban Pioneers.

But now the young beast-tamers with powerwoman Noora Louhimo are back with a loud roar entitled \u00bbBringer Of Pain\u00ab!\n\nFormed in 2008 BATTLE BEAST won the Wacken Metal Battle back in 2010. Followed by signing a record deal with German metal powerhouse Nuclear Blast and releasing their highly-acclaimed debut album \u00bbSteel\u00ab (2012), the band were seen touring successfully with their labelmates, symphonic metal masters NIGHTWISH.\n\nAfter the arrival of new frontwoman Noora Louhimo in 2012, the release of their self-titled sophomore record (2013) delivered them support slots for well-known bands such as SONATA ARCTICA and POWERWOLF among others.\n\nBATTLE BEAST\u2019s unstoppable way to the top of the metal world went on: With their third studio album entitled \u00bbUnholy Savior\u00ab, the band hit the charts in several European countries (#1 Finland, #23 UK Rock, #39 Germany,\u2026). On the release day, the group embarked on a big European tour with Swedish heavy metal heroes SABATON and DELAIN. In support of this record, BATTLE BEAST also toured European soil as a headlining band for the very first time.\n\nBut now the time of the \u00bbBringer Of Pain\u00ab is here: Once more, the Finns have crafted a top-notch piece of powerful heavy metal with the incomparably strong roars of frontbeast Noora Louhimo, catchy keyboards and earworm invasions. From the opening classical up-tempo opening track, \"Straight To The Heart\" to the last note of the closing ballad \"Far From Heaven\" BATTLE BEAST\u2019s new opus is full of heaviness and emotions.\n\n\u201cThe title is more than just a catchy punchline,\u201d bassist Eero Sipil\u00e4 explains. \"Bring the pain\" as a phrase means giving your best, stepping up against the odds - something that really sums up the spirit of this band and this album. The fact that the name also brought to mind a certain JUDAS PRIEST album definitely didn\u2019t hurt either...\u201d\n\nRecorded and produced at JKB Studios by keyboardist Janne Bj\u00f6rkroth, the 10-track album was also mixed by him alongside Viktor Gullichsen and Mikko Karmila, while mastering was done by Mika Jussila at the world famous Finnvox Studios. The colourful cover artwork was crafted by the specialist of realistic fantasy art, Jan Yrlund, who already worked with KORPIKLAANI and TYR among others and delivered a true piece of crazy metal art:\n\n\u201cThe cover art is mainly involved with the title track of the album, \u00bbBringer Of Pain\u00ab which - obviously - is about this super evil female character destroying stuff. We brainstormed a little around this topic and then sent some sketches to Jan (Yrlund), who returned with the picture: Some mean-looking woman who appears like she's coming through the box art to kick your ass. And since \"kicking ass\" is pretty much exactly what this band is about, we considered it a very fitting cover.\u201d\n\nAnd \"no pain, no gain\" has definitely been an issue during the last two years of the Finnish highflyers - in the middle of their touring cycle for the critically acclaimed \u00bbUnholy Savior\u00ab, they split with guitarist and main songwriter Anton Kabanen, but soon revealed Joona Bj\u00f6rkroth as a new fulltime member. Although fans might have feared a major style change, the Finns managed to keep their true signature sound alive:\n\n\u201cMost elements of our signature sound are still very much intact. Joona [Bj\u00f6rkroth; guitars] has been a friend of the band for a long time, and he always understood what BATTLE BEAST is about, both musically and ideologically. You could say the spirit of BATTLE BEAST was in him before he even joined, and that shows in his songwriting. Of course, when you have six people, each with their own ideas, influences and wishes, some clashes can\u2019t be avoided when conveying the creative energies. But in the end, I think that all works for the benefit of the band. With \u00bbBringer Of Pain\u00ab we managed to strike a good balance between sticking to our signature sound and covering some new ground. Keeping things fun and interesting while still sounding like ourselves.\u201d\n\nAnd they do indeed. In the end, BATTLE BEAST\u2019s formula is as simple as can be - so prepare for \u201c100% Heavy Metal - 0% Bullshit!\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8888480.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.448345, 37.802902], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Heavy Metal, Hard Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Palace Of Fine Arts"}, {"Address": "1929 Menalto Ave, Menlo Park, CA 94025", "Artist": "Gaby Castro", "ArtistBio": "Gaby Castro is an Americana singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, poet, model, actress, and activist.

I got the word back that the label thought maybe it was a good idea to put two CDs out\u2014one of them the slow stuff, more for listening, and the other, like B.B. King said, if you want to boogie-woogie all night long.\u201d The result has a title both simple and clever: Rhythm & Blues, the first double-album set of his storied career. But more than five decades into a life as one of the world\u2019s leading bluesmen, Buddy Guy is used to new surprises, challenges, and accolades. At age 76, he\u2019s a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, a major influence on rock titans like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, a pioneer of Chicago\u2019s fabled West Side sound, and a living link to that city\u2019s halcyon days of electric blues. He has received 6 Grammy Awards, 28 Blues Music Awards (the most any artist has received), the Billboard magazine Century Award for distinguished artistic achievement, and the Presidential National Medal of Arts. Rolling Stone ranked him in the top 25 of its \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\" The last year, in fact, has proven to be one of Guy\u2019s most remarkable ever. He was awarded the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime contribution to American culture; earlier in the year, at a performance at the White House, he even persuaded President Obama to join him on a chorus of \u201cSweet Home Chicago.\u201d Also in 2012, he published his long-awaited memoir, When I Left Home, and released Live at Legends, which has been nominated for Best New Recording in the Living Blues Awards. Meanwhile, Guy keeps looking to the future of the blues through his ongoing work with his 14-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Quinn Sullivan. Now the story continues with Rhythm & Blues, 21 tracks which feature contributions from a stellar and wide-ranging set of guests, including Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Brad Whitford of Aerosmith and rising guitar wizard Gary Clark, Jr. \u201cIf you watch a ballgame, it seems like those guys are angry at one another, but when they finish playing, they go out and have drinks together,\u201d says Guy. \u201cMusicians were doing that before anybody\u2014we don't have rivals as far as who can outplay who, but we have so much fun letting other people think that's what it is. So it\u2019s really a blessing to have all of these guys on here.\u201d He had a specific inspiration for a duet with his friend Kid Rock, realizing that \u201cMessin\u2019 with the Kid\u201d\u2014a 1960 hit for Guy\u2019s long-time partner Junior Wells\u2014was a perfect fit lyrically and musically. \u201cI was surprised he hadn't gotten there himself,\u201d says Guy. \u201cI saw him at the White House and I thought, \u2018I ain't gonna tell him, 'cause he might go and do it himself, I'm going to wait until I can do it!\u201d I threw it at him and he jumped the fence\u2014he did a hell of a job with it.\u201d Probably the most unexpected guest on Rhythm & Blues (which was produced by Guy\u2019s frequent collaborator Tom Hambridge, and recorded at Nashville\u2019s Blackbird Studios) is country superstar Keith Urban, who joins Guy on an emotional ballad called \u201cOne Day Away.\u201d Guy maintains that he was well aware of Urban\u2019s instrumental prowess before they teamed up. \u201cI listen to everything, regardless of what type of music it\u2019s branded,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I hear a guitar that makes me pat my feet, and try to not go to sleep 'cause I\u2019m afraid I might miss something, it's all right with me. Any guy who can think about playing music is a friend of mine, and the door is always open.\u201d One song in particular jumped out at Guy, a funky travelogue called \u201cMeet Me In Chicago\u201d written by slide guitar maestro Robert Randolph. \u201cI really fell in love with that one,\u201d he says. \u201cI been in Chicago 56 years\u2014that sounds just like me. It's not really blues, but it's a good beat, so I wanted to see if I could do something with it.\u201d Though Buddy Guy will forever be associated with Chicago, his story actually begins in Louisiana. One of five children, he was born in 1936 to a sharecropper\u2019s family and raised on a plantation near the small town of Lettsworth, located some 140 miles northwest of New Orleans. Buddy was just seven years old when he fashioned his first makeshift \u201cguitar\u201d\u2014a two-string contraption attached to a piece of wood and secured with his mother\u2019s hairpins. On the new album, he recounts these days on such deeply personal songs as \u201cI Came Up Hard\u201d and \u201cMy Mama Loved Me.\u201d In 1957, he took his guitar to Chicago, where he would permanently alter the direction of the instrument, first on numerous sessions for Chess Records playing alongside Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Muddy Waters, and the rest of the label\u2019s legendary roster, and then on recordings of his own. His incendiary style\u2014still in evidence all over Rhythm & Blues\u2014left its mark on guitarists from Jimmy Page to John Mayer. \u201cHe was for me what Elvis was probably like for other people,\u201d said Eric Clapton at Guy\u2019s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2005. \u201cMy course was set, and he was my pilot.\u201d These many years later, Buddy Guy is a genuine American treasure, and one of the final surviving connections to an historic era in the country\u2019s musical evolution. And still, as one glorious track on Rhythm & Blues puts it, he claims that \u201cAll That Makes Me Happy is the Blues.\u201d \u201cI worry a lot about the legacy of Muddy, Wolf, and all the guys who created this stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cI want people to remember them. It's like the Ford car\u2014Henry Ford invented the Ford car, and regardless how much technology they got on them now, you still have that little sign that says \u2018Ford\u2019 on the front. \u201cOne of the last things Muddy Waters told me\u2014when I found out how ill he was, I gave him a call and said, \u2018I'm on my way to your house.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Don't come out here, I'm doing all right. Just keep the damn blues alive.\u2019 They all told me that if they left here before I did, then everything was going to be on my shoulders. So as long as I'm here, I'm going to do whatever I can to keep it alive.\u201d Welcome to the official Facebook page of Chicago's very own Blues legend!

His signature sound is a roughhewn, low-timbered rock and roll that nods to the likes of Jeff Buckley, Neil Young, and Joe Cocker, and is powered by Raffoul\u2019s gravelly, soulful voice and deeply felt lyrics. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing for me \u2014 a song needs to be about something I\u2019ve experienced or something someone close to me is going through,\u201d Raffoul says of his sources of inspiration. \u201cI find myself going back to moments of time from the past, picking apart these little experiences and building them into bigger things. I want people to know that the songs are genuine, that they've been lived in.\u201d\n\n\u201cDriver\u201d is one of those lived-in songs. It was inspired by his family picking up a hitchhiker one night after Raffoul and his musician father Jody played a gig on Pelee Island in the middle of Lake Erie. \u201cThis guy was really out of it, so he ended up staying with us for a few hours,\u201d Raffoul says. The following weekend Raffoul told his story of the hitchhiker to songwriter Simon Wilcox and songwriterproducer Nolan Lambroza during a writing session in Los Angeles. \u201cWe turned it into something a little more sentimental, in that maybe I\u2019m not singing about someone being lost on the side of the road, but maybe someone lost in life who doesn't know where they\u2019re going or what they\u2019re supposed to be doing,\u201d he explains.\n\nRaffoul has been fairly certain of what he wanted to do with his life from a young age. He grew up in a creative family in the small farming town of Leamington, Ontario \u2014 \u201cthe tomato capital of Canada,\u201d as he puts it. His mother is an artist, writer, and teacher and his father Jody Raffoul is a solo artist and hometown hero who has opened for everyone from Joe Cocker to Bon Jovi. Raffoul\u2019s earliest musical influences come from his dad. \u201cThe Beatles were like Jesus in our house,\u201d he recalls, adding that he also listened to soul singers like Otis Redding and Sam Cooke. On his tenth birthday, Billy received a \u2018British Invasion\u2019-inspired guitar with a Union Jack on its front from Jody and started teaching himself to play. By 16, had bought his first real guitar \u2014 a 1968 Gibson Les Paul Black Beauty. \u201cIt\u2019s the same model and year as the only one Jimi Hendrix was ever photographed playing,\u201d Raffoul says.\n\nWhen Raffoul was in high school, he watched his dad headline a show for 4,000 people at his school\u2019s stadium. \u201cI remember in that moment thinking, \u2018This is cool,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI had appreciated music and written songs up until then, but I didn't think I wanted to be a live performer until that one show.\u201d Raffoul\u2019s first paying gig was playing to long-haul drivers at a local truck stop. \u201cFor the next three or four years I just put everything into it, playing out four and five nights a week in bars from Leamington to Detroit and back.\u201d\n\nEvery so often Raffoul would get a gig singing demos for hire. \u201cJust getting paid hourly to be the vocalist,\u201d he explains. \u201cOne day I went into the studio to sing on some Kid Rock demos. The guys heard my voice in the booth and asked if I had any original stuff. I played them two acoustic songs. They shot an iPhone video and sent it to my now-manager, who used to work with Kid Rock. The next day we drove down to Nashville.\u201d\n\nRaffoul now splits his time between Nashville and Los Angeles where, in between playing shows, he has been collaborating with other songwriters and slowly but surely assembling his debut album. \u201cSince it\u2019s my first record it feels like I\u2019ve been writing it my whole life,\u201d he jokes. In addition to \u201cDriver,\u201d Raffoul is proud of another new song called \u201cI\u2019m Not A Saint,\u201d which emerged from a conversation Raffoul had with his co-writer Julia Michaels. \u201cWe were talking about things we do or that we shouldn\u2019t do, like swear too much, smoke too much, lie too much, and it just flowed from there,\u201d Raffoul says. \u201cForty-five minutes later it was done.\u201d\n\nAs he gears up to finish his debut album, Raffoul is also eager to tour and see the world. \u201cI\u2019m putting everything into this record,\" he says, \"but I want to build my career on the live show. I want to be a true working musician.\" He knows that makes him sound like a traditionalist and he's fine with that. \"It\u2019s more of the old school way of doing things,\" he says. \"But I think that even in this ever-changing music business there will always be a thirst for live performance and that\u2019s what I want to do.

That might have been the question that saxophonist supreme Kenny Garrett faced following his \"poll vaulting\" and multiple-award nominated 2006 release, Beyond the Wall. But, trust, it was not a dilemma for Kenny Garrett. . Garrett, like all of the other great musicians and artists that came before him, just keeps moving forward in still another of his many creative directions. The latest of those ideas became Sketches of MD, a capricious excursion into open-ended melodies over grooves that reflect the artistry of key sidemen from Miles Davis' many groups \u2013 from John Coltrane to Kenny himself. Consisting of five compositions (and clocking in at just under an hour), Sketches of MD is a relaxed yet live record of some music Kenny performed at the Iridium Jazz Club in New York City with his band (Benito Gonzales on piano, Nat Reeves on bass, and Jamire Williams on drums) and special guest, tenor saxophone legend Pharoah Sanders. \"I had enough music to do a 'Beyond the Wall 2,'\" Garrett states, \"but I didn't want to do that since we already made that statement. Now it's about what's next. Once you try to define me, that's where problems begin because I'm not just doing one thing. I do straight ahead, I also do funk, classical and many other things. I'm always trying to challenge myself. Don't look for me to sound like my last record. I'm shifting \u2013 following what my spirit feels.\" Breaking down Sketches of MD, Kenny continues, \"I wanted to document the band I took on the road for Beyond the Wall while we were working with Pharoah and also write some new songs. The idea of doing the Miles-related songs just evolved. It's funkier than Beyond the Wall, but then again not really. When you think of John Coltrane's or McCoy Tyner's music, it had an ostinato, vamp kind of feel with elongated tunes. What we're doing is a little different basically because the beats are different.\" The result, captured before a captive audience in New York City, is a soul-stirring energy exchange. \"That's because this music was as new to the audience as it was to the band,\" Kenny explains. Though the opening number, \"The Ring,\" is initially reminiscent of Mingus' \"Goodbye Porkpie Hat,\" it ultimately mirrors the magic of a John Coltrane masterwork. \"I was hanging out with Pharoah at his house one day and we happened to be discussing overtones,\u201d Kenny shares. \"I came up with this riff and he told me I should work it into a tune. So when we got together for the Iridium dates, I surprised him with an outline for one. It is reminiscent of 'A Love Supreme' and that's what I was going for because the nature of the overtone suggested that. As we started to rehearse the tune, it began to take even fuller shape. Pharoah came up with a harmony part for it and every night we tried it a few different ways to see how we could make those pieces fit. It's not verbatim Trane, but the idea of it came from some stuff that Trane would probably do.\" Next is \"Intro to Africa,\" the haunting afro gospel-tinged meditation that closest reflects the black history that Kenny Garrett has always been about \u2013 from the bedrock piano and organ strains to the eerie effects he puts his horn through. It's the first part of a suite that Kenny will record in its entirety in the near future. But he felt compelled to introduce this part to the world early if only because of the way it inspired Pharoah the first time he shared it with him. \"I played it for Pharoah at a sound check and it immediately brought something out of him. He started singing. At that point I was just so happy that he intuitively understood it. When I wrote it, I had a feeling he'd get to it right away \u2013 be able to go to 'that place' again and reflect on some of the music he's written. This is just the intro, but it falls right in with the concept of this project being 'sketches' of larger things.\" The title track \"Sketches of MD\" is, clearly, Kenny\u2019s musings on Miles Davis, the music legend that Kenny had the honor and pleasure of recording and touring with the last five years of his life (1987-1991). \"I'm playing a lot of 'colors' on this one,' he explains. \"It's not about improvisation as much as the melodies. At the end when we break it down and do the free for all thing where I re-harmonize the chords over the bass line, it's all my take on my experiences with Miles. It wasn't planned. It just flowed that way. And my use of effects on the saxophone gives it a different flavor, too.\u201d \"Sketches\" puts the listener in a funk trance that takes you on a mystical journey from the Serengeti to the Solar System. No spoiler alerts here. Just see how many sketches of Miles' timeless melodies you can pick from this low swaying jazz branch. \"Wayne's Thang\" is a nod to saxophone and composing great Wayne Shorter that Kenny previously recorded on his 1995 CD Triology. This live version is certainly funkier \u2013 now more in line with the late, great Eddie Harris' \"Cold Duck Time\" especially with the extended use of full bar breaks in the middle. It's a crowd grabber and a perfect segue into the CD's encore \"Happy People,\" Kenny Garrett's \"greatest hit\" ever since he dropped the Cannonball Adderley-esque soul bomb on an unsuspecting world from his 2002 CD of the same name. It has not been unusual for Kenny\u2019s audience's to want the band to jam on this for well over half an hour. It just makes you feel so good! \"We played 'Happy People' in France once for 30 minutes opening for Herbie Hancock,\" Kenny recalls. \"When we got off the stage, Herbie said, 'Man, I can't believe you were able to get that kind of a response with an all-acoustic band!' I've been playing 'Happy People' for years, but I keep it in the set because people love it. It's just one of those tunes. The first time I played Thailand, they went crazy about that song. People have told me they've seen me playing it on YouTube. As you'll hear, we really got the audience at the Iridium into it, too.\" \"Herbie and I are coming from the same place,\" Kenny continues. \"That's partially because we had the same teacher \u2013 Miles. We're always searching to find a new way...fresh 'possibilities.' He's always reaching and mixing the music all together, which is what I'm doing. This record is just one facet of who I am.\" Thinking back on the time he's spent at the Iridium, it seems destined that he would record his latest statement within its ever-supportive confines. \"The first time I played with Pharoah was at the Blue Note, but I couldn't get anyone to come record it,\" Kenny laments. \"I told myself, 'The next time you play with Pharoah, document it yourself.' I play at the Iridium all the time because they provide me with the opportunity to come in and work out my new music. So it naturally just happened to be the place where I next played with Pharoah.\" And any occasion in which he can match wits with the ever spiritual Mr. Sanders is alright with Kenny. \"Pharoah's my man! We have a rapport. We challenge each other, but at the same time I'm his student. He likes that I can get the sound I get from an alto, which is similar to the tenor. It's always a blessing for me to have Pharoah in the band and to create some new music on the spot. I wanted us to create a new vision for that one week just to see what happened.\" Former WEA recording artist Kenny Garrett chose Detroit-based Mack Avenue as the home for his live project for a couple of reasons. \"I see Mack Avenue as an independent label with big ideas. They're making noise in my hometown, so I wanted to be a part of it. I didn't want a company that can't do something because all they know is the 'normal' way. I wanted fresh marketing \u2013 something beyond my core.\u201d Of course, true to his restless spirit, Kenny has already moved on from the music you hear on Sketches of MD. His current group consists of electric bass and organ! \"Sketches gave me a chance to reflect and do something new at the same time,\" Kenny reasons. \"My statements come when they're supposed to come. I don't really force them. I can't even compare this CD to Beyond the Wall, which a lot of people still haven't heard. But as more people are hearing it, I've shifted and moved on. There are so many ideas I want to do and not enough opportunities to record. Sketches of MD is one snapshot of some of the music on my mind.\" Summing up his concept of artistry, Kenny concludes, \"You have to keep living and gain more experiences. It is then that you can create. Whenever I do music, I do it to the highest level I can do it. That's what it's about. When I'm not here, will the music speak for itself?\" Sketches of MD is Kenny Garrett's live and high \u201cstandard of language\u201d...laid down loud and clear.

On this recording, Valdes is again featured with his Afro-Cuban Messengers, and the compositions include nods to flamenco, the Gnawa music of Morocco and the ritual rhythms of the Orishas, the deities of the Afro-Cuban Santer\u00eda religion. There are mentions of hard-bop and danz\u00f3n but also echoes of Bach, Rachmaninoff and Miles Davis -- and yet the sum total is a deeply personal and open-ended sound. And it\u2019s all Chucho Vald\u00e9s.\n\n\u201cSince I was a student I had this idea of taking disparate elements, mixing them and seeing what happened. And little by little, over time, I\u2019ve found my ways,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cAnd I love it because it\u2019s a search that forces you to investigate and study. It\u2019s not all about Afro-Cuban music. I\u2019m always looking for new things.\u201d\n\nThe concept in Border-Free \u201cwas to do many different things but all in my own style. Now, that is something very difficult to achieve.\u201d\n\nDionisio Jes\u00fas \"Chucho\" Vald\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, was born in a family of musicians in Quivic\u00e1n, Havana province, Cuba, October 9, 1941. His first teachers were his father, the pianist, composer and bandleader Ram\u00f3n \u201cBebo\u201d Vald\u00e9s, and his mother Pilar Rodr\u00edguez, who sang and played the piano.\n\nAt the age of three, Chucho already played at the piano, using both hands, in any key, melodies he heard on the radio. In fact, there is a famous anecdote that tells the story of Bebo tricking his friend, the late Israel \u201cCachao\u201d Lopez, about checking out, with his back to the player, \u201ca young North American pianist.\u201d Chucho was then four years old.\n\nAt the age of five, Chucho began to take lessons on piano, theory and solfege with maestro Oscar Mu\u00f1oz Boufartique. He continued his studies at the Conservatorio Municipal de M\u00fasica de la Habana, from which he graduated at 14. Chucho also took private lessons from Zenaida Romeu, Rosario Franco, Federico Smith and Leo Brouwer.\n\n\u201cAt home he played jazz: the music of Ellington, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller\u2019s band. I\u2019ve been privileged. Because Bebo was the piano player at the Tropicana I could see true legend of jazz in person. He took me to see Nat King Cole, Errol Garner and Sarah Vaughan when I was child studying music. You can\u2019t imagine the effect that had on my life! It was enormous! Magical!\nAt 15 Chucho formed his first jazz trio end in December 1958 he worked as a pianist at the Deauville and St. John hotels in Havana. In 1959, he debuted with the orchestra Sabor de Cuba, directed by his father, Bebo. That band accompanied the top singers of that era such as Rolando Laserie, Fernando \u00c1lvarez and P\u00edo Leyva.\n\n\u201cMy father taught me everything about Cuban music, South American music, jazz, and how to work with an orchestra,\u201d reminisces Chucho. \u201c He gave me the piano chair, and stayed on as director, so I could learn how to work under a conductor. We did our shows and a million other things with that orchestra, including accompanying shows at the Havana Hilton. I learned a lot there. He is my idol, \u201che pauses, then continues. \u201cI don\u00b4t say was, my idol. He is my idol. He was my teacher. He still is.\u201d\n\nChucho\u2019s family and professional life took a dramatic turn in 1960 when his father left to work in Mexico and from there he moved to Europe, where he eventually settled. Bebo Vald\u00e9s never returned to Cuba. (Father and son saw each other again 18 years later at Carnegie Hall, where Chucho was debuting in the United States with his group Irakere. The relationship was fully restored in 2000, when they met again to play a duet on Calle 54, a film about Latin jazz by Oscar winning Spanish director Fernando Trueba. The father and son reunion culminated, musically, in Juntos Para Siempre, a 2007 duet recording that won both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy. Bebo Vald\u00e9s died on March 22, 2013. He was 94.)\n\nIn the early \u201860s, Chucho worked as a pianist at the Teatro Mart\u00ed (1961), the Sal\u00f3n Internacional del Hotel Habana Riviera (1963) and the orchestra of the Teatro Musical de la Habana (1964-67). In 1967, and after a suggestion of his old teacher, the great guitarist, composer and director Leo Brouwer, Chucho organized his own combo.\n\nStill, that same year he joins the important Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, then directed by maestros Armando Romeu and Rafael Somavilla. While a member of the orchestra, Chucho revisited the idea of a small group and, in 1970, he appeared at the Jazz Jamboree in Poland leading his own quintet.\n\nIn 1972, after recording Jazz Bat\u00e1, an album featuring an unusual jazz trio comprising bassist Carlos del Puerto and singer and percussionist Oscar Vald\u00e9s on bat\u00e1 (the traditional hourglass shaped drums used in the ritual music of the Orishas), Chucho decided to enlarge the group adding brass and trap drums. That\u00b4s the genesis, in 1973, of Irakere, a small, Cuban-style big band that played an explosive mix of jazz, rock, classical music and traditional Cuban music, including Afro-Cuban religious music and instruments.\n\n\u201cThe ideas for the brass have to do with the work we did with the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, which was a great big band,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cI tried to imitate that with four horns -- two trumpets, a alto and a tenor sax -- and with just that try to have the sound of a big band. Of course when you have monster players like Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, [trumpeter] Jorge Varona and [saxophonist] Carlos Averhoff you can write anything you want and it will work.\u201d\nIrakere first made its mark internationally in Finland in 1976. But the following year, the band was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie in a visit to Havana on a jazz cruise that also included pianist Earl \u201cFatha\u201d Hines and saxophonist Stan Getz. In 1978 the producer Bruce Lundvall, then president of CBS, signed the band for the label. Irakere debuted, unannounced, as \u201csurprise guests,\u201d at Carnegie Hall as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. As fate would have it, the program that night also featured pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, two of Chucho\u2019s main influences.\n\nSelections from Irakere\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival comprised the repertory of Irakere (CBS) their debut recording in the United States. The album won a Grammy as Best Latin Recording in 1979.\n\nThe group went on to create an extraordinary body of work that includes great dance recordings such as Homenaje a Beny Mor\u00e9 (Pimienta, 1989) and Indestructible (Sony, 1997); explorations of Afro-Cuban religious music such as Babal\u00fa Ay\u00e9 (Bemb\u00e9, 1999) featuring the great Orisha music singer L\u00e1zaro Ros; as well as ambitious projects such as Tierra En Trance (Are\u00edto, 1983) and Misa Negra (Messidor, 1987)\n\nIrakere\u2019s lineup went through many changes over the years. Throughout, Chucho remained as the one, great constant. But success had its costs. Except for the remarkable solo outing Lucama (Mission, 1986), his talent as a pianist was largely out of sight, obscured by his other obligations with the band.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1997, Chucho won his second Grammy for his work on Habana (Verve) as a member of trumpeter Roy Hargrove\u2019s Crisol. The following year, while not completely leaving Irakere behind, Chucho started a parallel career as a solo player and quartet leader, looking for greater opportunities to explore and showcase his playing.\n\n\u201cTwenty five years with the same band is a long time,\u201d said Chucho at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to play solo and with a quartet for some time now. My work as a pianist and soloist gets diluted in Irakere. My job in the group is to be the composer, arranger and musical director and that\u2019s a completely different role.\u201d\n\nChucho stayed with Irakere until 2005.\n\nThe fruitful period that followed is highlighted by albums such as Solo Piano (Blue Note, 1991), Solo: Live in New York (Blue Note, 2001) and New Conceptions (Blue Note, 2003), as well as quartet recordings such as Bele Bele en La Habana (Blue Note, 1998), Briyumba Palo Congo (Blue Note, 1999) and Live at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note, 2000), capturing a performance that features Chucho\u2019s sister, singer Mayra Caridad Vald\u00e9s . The recording won a Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album.\n\nThere were also Grammy awards for the already mentioned Juntos Para Siempre (Calle 54, 2007), the duet recording with Bebo; and for Chucho\u2019s Steps (Comanche, 2010), featuring his new group, the Afro-Cuban Messengers .\n\nIn total, Chucho has won five Grammys and three Latin Grammys.\n\nIn 2012, Chucho reorganized his Afro-Cuban Messengers which currently feature Yaroldy Abreu, percussion, Dreiser Durruthy Bombal\u00e9 , bat\u00e1 drums and voice; Reinaldo Meli\u00e1n, trumpet, Gast\u00f3n Joya, bass and Rodney Barreto, drums.\n\nHis most recent production, Border-Free, is yet another expression of the continuing musical search and evolution of Chucho Vald\u00e9s as a pianist, composer, arranger and director.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9040181.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Latin-Jazz", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "SFJAZZ Center - Miner Auditorium"}, {"Address": "400 Eddy St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "Theo Croker", "ArtistBio": "Producer, composer, & trumpeter Theo Croker is an adventurous musician whose adept skills find him at home playing standards, swinging post-bop, or more groove-oriented electric jazz.

In 2016, he delivered Escape Velocity, which found him delving deeper into a genre-bending, spiritually enlightened, funk-influenced jazz sound.\n\nUpon the album\u2019s release, The Wall Street Journal heralded the album as \u201c timeless and of-the-moment\u201d. His live performances, the Huffington Post lauded Croker\u2019s band DVRKFUNK, saying they were \u201ca tight front line that weave in serpentine precision and are backed by a powerful rhythm section that pushes the groove.\u201d Outside of his solo career, Croker has lent his inimitable talents as composer, arranger and musician to J.

The blistering guitarist, soulful vocalist, singular songwriter and city bus driver fuses his muscular, rock-inspired blues guitar playing with his original, keenly detailed slice-of-life songs, blazing his own blues trail. With the 2016 release of his Alligator Records debut, The Chicago Way, Cannon burst onto the international stage as one the most electrifying bluesmen to emerge from Chicago in decades. His live performances unfailingly earn him heaps of critical praise and hordes of wildly enthusiastic fans. Cannon has played major cities all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe. He recently performed for the first time in Japan, delighting and surprising audiences with one unforgettable gig after another. Now, with the release of The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Cannon builds upon the foundation he\u2019s laid, creating and defining his vision of contemporary blues.\n\nThe Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp features twelve Cannon originals, ranging from the burning social commentary of the title track to the wryly told, up-to-the-minute truths of Insurance to the trademark Cannon humor of Stop Me When I\u2019m Lying and Ordinary Woman. He gets serious on the haunting The First 24, the Martin Luther King-inspired The Silence Of My Friends and on the moving final track, I\u2019m Not Scared. Cannon\u2019s blazing guitar and soul-baring vocals are front and center. His songwriting is inspired by his deep Chicago roots, the wisdom of his grandparents and his years of observing the public while driving a bus. His songs tell timeless stories of common experiences in uncommon ways.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the solos,\u201d Cannon says, \u201cIt\u2019s about the songs. People get used to everyday life, so it\u2019s easy to miss the things around them. I write about those things. I know the problems of Chicago, the hardship, 'cause we\u2019re always a scapegoat. But I choose to love and respect the city because of the Chicago blues giants that came here from down south. I\u2019m proud to be standing on the shoulders of every great Chicago blues musician who came before me.\u201d\n\nToronzo Cannon was born in the Windy City on February 14, 1968, and grew up in the shadows of the notoriously tough Robert Taylor Homes. Theresa\u2019s Lounge, one of the city\u2019s most famous South Side blues clubs, was nearby. As a child, Cannon would stand on the sidewalk outside the door, soaking up the live blues pouring out while trying to sneak a glance inside at larger-than-life bluesmen like Junior Wells and Buddy Guy. He also heard plenty of blues growing up in his grandfather\u2019s home, and listened to soul, R&B and contemporary rock on the radio.\n\nCannon bought his first guitar at age 22, and his natural talent enabled him to quickly master the instrument. Although his initial focus was reggae, he found himself increasingly drawn to the blues. \u201cIt was dormant in me. But when I started playing the blues, I found my voice and the blues came pouring out.\u201d He absorbed sounds, styles and licks from Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Hound Dog Taylor, B.B. King, Albert King, Freddie King, Jimi Hendrix, J.B. Hutto, Lil\u2019 Ed and others. Although influenced by many, Cannon\u2019s biting, stinging guitar sound is all his own.\n\nCannon began his rise in the intensely competitive proving ground of the local club scene, where only the best musicians reach the top. Iconic blues artists from Muddy Waters to Howlin\u2019 Wolf to Koko Taylor to Hound Dog Taylor to Luther Allison all paid their dues in the Chicago blues bars before making their mark on the world. The same holds true today, as newcomers look to living legends like Buddy Guy, Jimmy Johnson and Lil\u2019 Ed Williams for inspiration in taking their music from Chicago to fans across the globe.\n\nFrom 1996 through 2002, Cannon played as a sideman for Tommy McCracken, Wayne Baker Brooks, L.V. Banks and Joanna Connor. But he was determined to prove himself. In 2001, while continuing to work as a hired-gun guitarist, he formed his own band, The Cannonball Express. By 2003, he was working exclusively as a band leader. Cannon\u2019s first three albums\u20142007\u2019s My Woman (self-released), 2011\u2019s Leaving Mood (Delmark) and 2013\u2019s Blues Music Award-nominated John The Conqueror Root (Delmark)\u2014document his rise from promising up-and-comer to star-in-the-making.\n\nAlmost immediately upon the release of The Chicago Way, Chicago media helped launch Cannon toward blues stardom. He was the subject of multiple newspaper and magazine feature stories and appeared on every local television station. National and international media soon took notice. CNN filmed Cannon leading a tour of Chicago blues clubs and then broadcast the piece around the world. England\u2019s MOJO magazine declared The Chicago Way the #1 Blues Album Of 2016, as did the readers of Living Blues magazine in their annual poll. The album and Cannon were also nominated for four Blues Music Awards (the Grammy of the blues) in 2017. And the world champion Chicago Cubs invited Cannon to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the September 13, 2017 game. All the attention only makes Cannon more focused. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become an ambassador for Chicago blues. People expect a lot from me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s good, because I\u2019m forced to keep upping my game.\u201d\n\nCannon has played the Chicago Blues Festival on ten separate occasions, initially as a sideman, then as a special guest, a sidestage band leader and finally as a main stage headliner. When he\u2019s home, he drives a Chicago Transit Authority bus by day and performs by night. Using every vacation day and day off and working four ten-hour shifts a week, Cannon arranges his schedule to gig out of town as much as possible. It isn\u2019t easy, but, like all of the Chicago greats who have come before him, blues is his calling. Blues Music Magazine declares, \u201cHis guitar playing has all the fire and spontaneity of the Chicago legends he carries; his songwriting is a timely and original look at the world he sees by day on a bus and in blues clubs by night, and his assertive voice is the perfect vehicle to deliver the message.\u201d\n\nNow, with The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Toronzo Cannon delivers his messages loud and clear. Between his searing chops, soul-satisfying vocals and vibrant and distinctive original songs, Cannon has grown from being a local attraction to become a world-renowned torch bearer for the blues. PBS Television\u2019s Chicago Tonight sums it up like this: \u201cCannon is just your typical CTA bus driver who moonlights as a sought-after Chicago blues musician. As a guitarist, singer and songwriter, he drives the sound of Chicago blues from the city to blues clubs and festivals around the world.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9056735.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-91.485146, 46.012699], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Blues", "OtherInfo": "Admission is $20 in advance, $30 at the door.

What began as a single show tribute at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2000 has blossomed into a full-fledged concert experience that has thrilled countless fans across the U.S. The tour, which the Chicago Tribune called \"a testament to the legacy of the iconic guitarist,\" presents a host of great artists collaborating and interpreting Hendrix's legendary repertoire as part of a dynamic, non-stop three-hour concert experience.\n\nThe Experience Hendrix Tour offers fans a rare opportunity to see critically lauded musicians performing timeless Jimi Hendrix classics such as \"Purple Haze,\" \"Foxey Lady,\" \"Voodoo Child\" and \"Little Wing\" in a unique setting. This latest edition of the tour will feature guitar wizard Joe Satriani and the triumphant return of blues legend Buddy Guy, as well as Taj Mahal, Dweezil Zappa, Jonny Lang and Eric Johnson. Mainstays Billy Cox, Slide Brothers and Doyle Bramhall II will also be on board for the duration. Todd Park Mohr, singer/guitarist for Colorado favorites Big Head Todd & the Monsters, will make his Experience Hendrix Tour debut on October 16 at Pikes Peak Center in Colorado Springs.\n\nGuitarist/singer Buddy Guy's recording career began in earnest in the 1950s when he migrated from Louisiana to be part of the burgeoning Chicago blues scene. Jimi Hendrix, whose own music is firmly rooted in the blues, was heavily influenced by the work of Guy, who is six years Hendrix's senior. The two became friends, even sharing the stage together. This October will mark Buddy Guy's ninth Experience Hendrix Tour. Always a crowd favorite, the polka dot-adorned 82-year-old (83 when the tour starts) is looking forward to paying tribute to his own \"buddy.\"\n\n15-time Grammy Award nominee Joe Satriani, who recently came off the eastern leg of the Experience Hendrix Tour, will be back for the October 1 kickoff in Jimi's hometown of Seattle. Notable for being the biggest-selling instrumental rock guitarist of all time, Satriani came to the forefront with the release of his 1987 solo album Surfing with the Alien. He has worked with Mick Jagger, Deep Purple, Alice Cooper, Blue Oyster Cult and the fabled Spinal Tap and is a member of rock super group Chickenfoot. In keeping with the spirit of the Experience Hendrix Tour, Satriani has formed an all-star trio especially for the occasion, calling upon bassist and vocalist dUg Pinnick from King's X, and prolific sideman Kenny Aronoff on drums to serve as his rhythm section.\n\n\"The Experience Hendrix Tours are always so much fun,\" Satriani told Billboard. \"The camaraderie between all the musicians on the show is magical. I'm so excited to play some deep Hendrix tracks in a power trio setting with dUg Pinnick and Kenny Aronoff!\"\n\nLike Buddy Guy, singer-songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Taj Mahal knew Jimi Hendrix personally. Virtually the same age, the two had contemporaneous careers that similarly navigated the blues world and the much larger rock world. Taj Mahal has been a staple of past Experience Hendrix Tours, and has the utmost admiration for his old friend. \"He [Jimi] moved the blues \u2014 the language of the music \u2014 into the future.\"\n\nBilly Cox, bassist for both Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsys and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, has been the backbone of the tour since its inception, providing a spiritual connection between the past and present. Rounding out the lineup are drummer and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Chris Layton of Steve Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, as well as Mato Nanji of Indigenous, Henri Brown and bassist Kevin McCormick.\n\n\"There's something so special about playing Seattle. Author Thomas Wolfe wrote, 'You can't go home again,' but that's definitely not the case with Jimi,\" said his sister Janie Hendrix, CEO of Experience Hendrix, L.L.C. \"His music is like a beacon that always brings him back to Seattle, where it all began. Celebrating his legacy here brings it full circle. Even the musicians play stronger, as if they're channeling the vibe of Jimi. We love Seattle, it's home ... it's family.\"\n\nCritics have been gushing about the Experience Hendrix Tour since its inception. \"Hendrix's classic songs came one after the next and the electric licks were delivered by a who's who of modern guitar greats,\" noted Loudwire, which went on to call it \"the guitar tour of the year.\" Charleston City Paper stated, \"Jimi's spirit and music could not have been honored more.\"\n\n\"At the very end of the night, all the participants came back out for a final bow,\" Consequence of Sound observed this past March. \"And one thing you couldn't help but realize by this point \u2014 the music of Jimi Hendrix will seemingly live on forever, and continue to inspire future generations.\"\n\nThe 2019 Experience Hendrix Tour is sponsored by Fender Musical Instruments, the renowned manufacturer of Jimi's iconic Stratocaster guitars, along with Dunlop, Hal Leonard, and Axe Heaven.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9124596.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.268586, 37.809866], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "LINEUP (*subject to change): Buddy Guy Billy Cox From Band of Gypsys and Jimi Hendrix Experience Joe Satriani Jonny Lang Dweezil Zappa Doyle Bramhall II Eric Johnson Dug Pinnick from King's X Chris Layton from Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble Mato Nanji from Indigenous Kenny Aronoff Slide Brothers Henri Brown Kevin McCormick", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Paramount Theatre-Oakland"}, {"Address": "2025 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Eric Johnson", "ArtistBio": "Eric Johnson\u2019s stature as one of the premier guitar players in contemporary music is his artistic trump card, backed by a Grammy Award and five nominations, platinum album, Top 10 hits like \u201cCliffs Of Dover,\u201d praise from critics and the esteem of his peers. But the full hand of his talents marks him as well as a gifted songwriter, dynamic live performer, singer, pianist, song interpreter, and creator of a rich and diverse musical legacy. His myriad and distinctive musical gifts are vividly evident on Johnson\u2019s aptly titled new album, Up Close, released on his own Vortexan Music label via EMI Distribution. The new 15-track disc finds the noted master craftsman cutting loose, roaming through variations on the rock, blues, pop, country and jazz all found at the core of his sound, pushing the dynamic range of his artistry, and mixing it up with such friends and peers as guitarists Jimmie Vaughan and Sonny Landreth and guest singers Steve Miller, Jonny Lang and Malford Milligan. \u201cI decided to let go a bit and allow things to happen and just go with the flow,\u201d explains Johnson of his approach to the album. \u201cI think that\u2019s a direction that works better for any artist, and especially for me. I like my work to have a high proficiency, but I also wanted to go for the energy and magic of the performances.\u201d That vitality and vivid musicality brims from such hook-filled numbers as the hard-rocking instrumentals \u201cFat Daddy\u201d and \u201cVortexan\u201d and the driving vocal song \u201cBrilliant Room\u201d (sung by Milligan). \u201cGem\u201d is splashed with bright and painterly six-string colors, \u201cSoul Surprise\u201d finds Johnson weaving a picturesque tapestry of both his guitar and piano gifts, and \u201cArithmetic\u201d summons up a swirling and spectral kaleidoscope of guitars, keyboards and Johnson\u2019s singing. His early years and influences are explored on the Mike Bloomfield/Buddy Miles-composed blues song \u201cTexas\u201d (from the 1968 Electric Flag album A Long Time Comin\u2019) on which Miller sings and Johnson\u2019s and Vaughan\u2019s guitars engage in stirring interplay, and \u201cAustin\u201d (sung by Lang), which looks back to his teens in his hometown as a budding player and avid music fan who would be allowed to slip underaged into music nightclubs and \u201cgo sit in the back and listen to bands.\u201d \u201cOn The Way\u201d is a delightful Texas meets Tennessee twang romp, and \u201cA Change Has Come To Me\u201d opens with a six-string nod to Jimi Hendrix (a prime Johnson influence) that carries through the track as it burgeons into a celebration of the pleasures of the deep and soulful groove. Interstitial instrumental snippets like the spellbinding Indian music-flavored opener \u201cAwaken\u201d and the dreamlike \u201cTraverse\u201d and \u201cThe Sea And The Mountain\u201d plus \u201cChange (Revisited)\u201d weave the collection together. And Johnson caps the CD with the uplifting grace note of \u201cYour Book\u201d on which he and Landreth interweave their playing (including Johnson\u2019s stately piano work) with emotive elegance. The lyrical themes of reflection, emotional revelations, personal growth and fulfillment are underscored on the album by Johnson\u2019s most daring, urgent, progressive and at times raw and fervent guitar work to date. With its sonic immediacy (thanks to a mix by engineering legend Andy Johns) and openhearted musicality and songwriting, Up Close truly lives up to its name as Johnson continues to forge fresh and compelling new dimensions of his artistry. Johnson leapt to the forefront of contemporary music some 20 years ago as \u201can extraordinary guitar player accessible to ordinary music fans,\u201d as the Memphis Commercial Appeal hails him, with his landmark million selling 1990 album Ah Via Musicom. Lauded as a \u201crecording [that] has reached near-classic proportions within the guitar community\u201d by All Music Guide, it was preceded by dedicated groundwork as a live performer that marked him as a talent bound for great things. And it\u2019s been followed by a diverse and fascinating musical journey that inspired The New Age Music Guide to rave that \u201cEric Johnson plays guitar the way Michelangelo painted ceilings: with a colorful vibrancy that\u2019s more real than life.\u201d His many achievements include being enshrined in Guitar Player\u2019s Gallery of Greats and named one of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of the 20th Century by Musician magazine alongside numerous other awards. He also enjoys the admiration of many of his fellow players and has performed and/or recorded with such notables as Chet Atkins, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani and others, and follows the release of Up Close with an acoustic Guitar Masters tour sharing the stage with six-string masters Peppino D\u2019Agostino and Andy McKee. He was tapped by Eric Clapton to appear at the 2004 Crossroads Guitar Festival and plays his second stint of the Experience Hendrix tour in fall 2010. He has paid homage in song to such players as Jerry Reed (\u201cTribute to Jerry Reed\u201d on his album Bloom), fellow Texan Stevie Ray Vaughan (the Grammy-nominated track \u201cSRV\u201d) and Wes Montgomery (who Johnson saluted in his Ah Via Musicom song \u201cEast Wes\u201d), and boasts both a signature Fender Stratocaster electric and Martin MC-40 acoustic guitar. \u201cCliffs of Dover\u201d is featured in the video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock as the final winning challenge. And in addition to his recordings, tours and DVDs under his own name, Johnson also plays with his side project Alien Love Child, which released an in concert album in 2000, Live and Beyond, that earned an instrumental Grammy nomination for the song \u201cRain.\u201d Even before his breakthrough with Ah Via Musicom, Johnson made his indelible musical mark with his 1986 first album release Tones. It landed him on the cover of Guitar Player magazine, which hailed the album as \u201ca majestic debut,\u201d and earned him his first Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance with the track \u201cZap.\u201d Ah Via Musicom won Johnson a Grammy for \u201cCliffs Of Dover,\u201d which was one of his record three Top 10 instrumental hits from a single album alongside \u201cTrademark\u201d and \u201cRighteous.\u201d Following three years of concerted touring that established him as a continuing popular concert attraction, Johnson recorded Venus Isle, which on its release in 1996 garnered him another Grammy nomination. In 1998, his previously unreleased first album recording from 1976, Seven Worlds, was finally issued. A limited-release collection of demos, outtakes and live tracks, Souvenir, hit the streets in 2002. His most recent studio album, 2005\u2019s Bloom, yielded a fifth Grammy nomination. Johnson\u2019s success over the last 20 years was presaged by a grassroots rise in which he made his bones and burgeoning reputation as a formidable musical talent and player since he first became a local sensation in the Austin clubs as a teen with the psychedelic rock band Mariani. Trained on classical piano as a youth, he switched to the guitar after the stateside arrival of the Beatles in 1964. As a young player he delved deeply into blues, jazz, country and other styles that inform his music. By the mid-1970s, Johnson began touring and sparking a buzz about his astonishing talents in the jazz-rock outfit Electromagnets, whose recordings and a live TV performance from that era were released in the 1990s to critical acclaim. He cut his teeth in the studio on sessions for Cat Stevens, Christopher Cross and Carole King, and by 1984 his stature in Texas and beyond was so strong that the unsigned artist was tapped to make his first appearance on the prestigious PBS concert show \u201cAustin City Limits.\u201d At the urging of such stars as Cross and Prince, Johnson was signed to a major label deal with Reprise Records and emerged onto the international recording scene. His dynamism as a live performer is captured on the 2008 DVD Anaheim as well as the 2005 DVD/CD release of his second \u201cAustin City Limits\u201d show in 1994, Live From Austin, Texas. His 1996 G3 tour with fellow guitarists Joe Satriani and Steve Vai yielded a best selling album and platinum DVD, G3: Live in Concert. Johnson\u2019s eminence as a musical artist goes well beyond just his stunning guitar mastery. His keen compositional sense and lyrical playing create instrumentals that speak to listeners and convey thoughts, emotions and imagery, and Up Close also spotlights his singing and sure way with words. \u201cIt really boils down to the music and the song at the end of the day,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t have that it gets boring for me.\u201d On his new release, \u201cI wanted to bare myself a little further and show myself more,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cAs you evolve as a person and artist, you reach forks in the road where you look at what it is you really want in life and to bring out in yourself and thereby affect other people. What\u2019s most important to me is to grow as a person, and because of that, I want my music to also grow and have more of a profound meaning and impact.\u201d And Up Close finds Eric Johnson continuing to expand his artistry with compelling and enriching results. \"Collage\" Collage: http://apple.co/2AsrqoH \"EJ\" http://smarturl.it/EJ-EJ-Digi http://smarturl.it/EJ-MLG \"Eclectic\" Amazon: http://tinyurl.com/mdbcx3t", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8811733.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.268586, 37.809866], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter, Guitar Virtuoso, Instrumental, Country, Blues-Rock, Acoustic, Acoustic Blues, Electric Blues, Electric Jazz, Classic Rock", "OtherInfo": "LINEUP (*subject to change): Buddy Guy Billy Cox From Band of Gypsys and Jimi Hendrix Experience Joe Satriani Jonny Lang Dweezil Zappa Doyle Bramhall II Eric Johnson Dug Pinnick from King's X Chris Layton from Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble Mato Nanji from Indigenous Kenny Aronoff Slide Brothers Henri Brown Kevin McCormick", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Paramount Theatre-Oakland"}, {"Address": "650 Geary St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Kat Robichaud", "ArtistBio": "katrobichaud.com\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/katrowbeeshow ...\n\nSpotify: https://goo.gl/CYpTp6\niTunes: https://goo.gl/nezTkM\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/LcBC2S\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/FbKfp7\nPatreon: https://goo.gl/bx693T\n\nLink to Kat's videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/KatRobichaud", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9187344.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.414033, 37.787047], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Theatrical rock and roll", "OtherInfo": "Misfit Cabaret's 3rd Halloween installment- featuring things that go BUMP in the night.\nMisfit Cabaret is a splendiferous variety show centered around magical music with a rotating cast of eccentric performers.

His singing, yodeling, growling, leering and brash preachin\u2019 and hollerin\u2019 is accompanied by sloppy riffs and licks from his '59 Gibson guitar and pounding backbeat brought forth by his amplified left foot. The remainder of this one-man band consists of an unwieldy combination of beat-up amplifiers and old microphones strung together by a tangled mess of guitar cables.\n\nYears of non-stop touring have honed his assault to a fine edge; his wide-eyed throw downs in the First Church of Ultimate Fanaticism routinely lead giddy followers to a fiery baptism.\n\nScott H.

It was inevitable that from the moment of his birth his life would be filled wall-to wall with music (his father having listed his religion as \u201cmusician\u201d on Dweezil\u2019s birth certificate). Dweezil\u2019s early years were spent largely away from the spotlight\u2014something of a rarity for the child of a celebrity, but perfect for cultivating a close relationship with his family. Having watched his father perform concerts from the side of the stage since he was in diapers it was no surprise that he began to show an interest in music early on. At 6 years old he received his first guitar, a Fender Music Master from his dad.It wasn't until he was 12 that he began to show a serious interest in manipulating the instrument to make music. Having primarily heard the music his father was working on or listening to at home while growing up, Dweezil soon found himself exposed to some new sounds on the radio. Besides his father's music he began listening to the Beatles, Queen, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Like many aspiring guitarists of his generation, Dweezil \u2018s ear was caught in a stranglehold by the trailblazing guitar styles of Edward Van Halen and Randy Rhoads. To gain more fundamental knowledge of technique and scales Dweezil was fortunate to have some assistance from one of the musicians in his father's band at that time, Steve Vai. Dweezil became remarkably proficient in a very short amount of time due to his intense practicing sessions. Later that year he recorded his first single, \u201cMy Mother Is A Space Cadet\u201d, produced by Edward Van Halen and released on Frank Zappa\u2019s Barking Pumpkin label. In 1984, Dweezil contributed guitar solos to both \u201cStevie\u2019s Spanking\u201d and \u201cSharleena\u201d on Frank\u2019s album Them Or Us. In 1986, Dweezil made his debut in Hollywood as an actor with his role in the classic 80s film \u201cPretty In Pink.\" 1987 saw Dweezil raise his profile further with another film role alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mick Fleetwood in \"The Running Man.\" In television he worked as a guest MTV VJ. During that same period he recorded and released his first full length album, Havin\u2019 A Bad Day. This album contained the single \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About It\u201d which featured Moon Zappa on vocals and found itself on regular rotation on MTV. The video featured cameo appearances from Frank Zappa, Robert Wagner, Don Johnson and Jane Fonda as well. Around this same time, Dweezil made his own cameo appearances on records for a variety of diverse artists. He played a solo on the Fat Boys \"Baby You're A Rich Man\u201d as well as on the Grammy Nominated cover of \"Wipeout\" with Herbie Hancock and Terry Bozzio from the \"Back To The Beach\" film soundtrack. He was asked to join Stevie Ray Vaughan and Bonnie Raitt in contributing guitar performances to Miami Vice star Don Johnson's solo album. While Dweezil actually played on the song \"The Last Sound Love Makes\" it was his appearance in the video for Don Johnson\u2019s single \u201cHeartbeat\" that would most notably link him to the project. 1988 saw Dweezil sign a deal with Chrysalis Records, releasing his second album My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama. More TV work followed in 1990 Dweezil and Moon Zappa starred with Laverne And Shirley legend Cindy Williams in a sitcom for CBS titled Normal Life. With the release of his third album Confessions in 1991, Dweezil began to branch out musically, blending his heavy rock approach with touches of his father\u2019s distinct compositional insignia. Guest appearances on this album pointed the way toward the future for Dweezil, including contributions from Nuno Bettencourt , Gary Cherone and Pat Badger of Extreme and legendary guitarists Warren DeMartini, Steve Lukather and Zakk Wylde as well as Frank Zappa sidemen Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes. Both Moon and Ahmet Zappa also added vocals to the album. Dweezil conceived and directed 2 videos from the album, 'Gotta Get To You' and 'Vanity' both of which featured Robert Wagner as a guest star. Robert Wagner has appeared in 4 of Dweezil's videos as well as the \"Music For Pets\" infomercial spoof. There were a handful of live shows played to support the Confessions album. That tour saw the band develop a unique set of skills and usher in the birth of a remarkable non stop medley that grew to contain 200 songs performed in 20 minutes. After completing the Confessions tour Dweezil formed a new band and project with Ahmet called Z. Armed with a mountain of material and no permanent drummer the band entered the family owned rehearsal space called Joe's Garage and rehearsed with several different drummers who ended up playing on tracks for the new album. Those drummers included Terry Bozzio, Mark Craney, Toss Panos, and Tal Bergman. Rather than move to a studio they set up for recording rehearsals. The band recorded over 3 dozen tracks at Joe's Garage. The \"Shampoohorn\" album was completed in 1992 but awaited it's release over a year later. It was eventually released with 2 different track listings. The band featured Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes and initiated it's new permanent drummer, Berklee School Of Music-trained drummerpar excellence Joe Travers before departing for a world tour. Thunes departed later in 1994 and was replaced by Bryan Beller who had attended classes at Berklee alongside Joe Travers. The band toured the US and Europe in 1995. They played original material as well as some more oddball medleys including the infamous \"Peavey Medley.\" In 1996 they released a follow-up album, Music For Pets. By the time of the album\u2019s release, both Beller and Keneally had left the band and Z gradually ceased to exist. Dweezil stayed in the public eye however with several projects including composing the theme music for the Emmy Award winning Fox television show \"The Ben Stiller Show\" and on camera TV appearances including taking the role of Ajax in the Klasky Csupo animated series Duckman and a TV series for the USA network called Happy Hour which he starred in alongside Ahmet. 2000 saw Dweezil issue his first solo album since 1991\u2019s Confessions... with the release of Automatic. By this time, Dweezil\u2019s musicianship had come full-circle as he showed off his guitar virtuosity with eclectic all guitar orchestrations of \"You're A Mean One Mr. Grinch\" and \"Hawaii 5-0.\" In 2003 More television work came about as Dweezil formed a band for the WB unconventional improvisational comedy \"On The Spot\" and performed live in each episode. He also composed the theme music for the WB series \"The Jamie Kennedy Experiment\" and composed dozens of tracks for the music library Extreme Music. Many of these track are heard on various television shows around the world. The next several years saw Dweezil preparing to take on an extremely difficult challenge\u2014bringing his father\u2019s legendary music back to the concert stage. In 2006, some indication of what could be expected surfaced with Dweezil\u2019s next solo album Go With What You Know. The Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa band's current 2014 lineup is known as the \"rocking teenage combo.\" Now a 6 piece they are firing on all cylinders propelled by the ryhthm section of Ryan Brown on drums and Kurt Morgan on bass. Boundless energy is contributed by the rest of the line up which includes original core member multi-instrumentalist Sheila Gonzalez, as well as multi-year veterans Chris Norton on keyboards and vocals as well as vocals/brass/miscellaneous from Ben Thomas. Currently Dweezil has developed his online guitar course for students. It's branded as \"DWEEZOLOGY\" and is available here on the DZW site http://www.dweezilzappaworld.com/pages/dweezology as well as on line at truefire.com. He has also participated with the likes of Jazz legends Mike Stern and Lee Ritenour in the top notch Crown Of The Continent guitar festival in Montana. 2014 marked the inaugural Frank Zappa scholarship at the festival. Dweezil plans to return to \"Montana soon...\" to participate and contribute to future COC events. 2015 marked a milestone for Dweezil's Zappa Plays Zappa project. The band has consistently played concerts around the world for the past 10 years. Racking up well over 1,000 shows. In that time Dweezil did not have a time to cultivate his own music. November 27th 2015 marks the release of Dweezil's first new album since \"Go With What You Know\" in 2006. Dweezil Zappa has returned to his musical roots with his new CD release Via Zammata'. Fusing analog tape and tube guitar amps alongside surprising instruments such as fretless guitar and the oud, Zappa draws you into his intimate, and multifarious musical world. Armed with unexpected vocal arrangements that sound like the Beach Boys procreated with the Bulgarian Women's Choir, this collection of 12 uniquely orchestrated songs represents a true metamorphosis for Dweezil Zappa the solo artist. The album was produced and arranged by Dweezil Zappa and features songwriting collaborations with Frank Zappa and venerable actor John Malkovich. Dweezil found himself in the midst of some controversy and family drama after the passing of his Mother. The Zappa Family Trust, now operated by Dweezil's 2 younger siblings, fired off a cease and desist letter to Dweezil. The letter required Dweezil to immediately stop using the name Zappa Plays Zappa. A story about this dispute was printed by the New York Times on April 29, 2016. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/business/media/whats-in-a-name-just-ask-frank-zappas-feuding-heirs.html?_r=0 In response to the letter from the ZFT, Dweezil changed the name of his band to Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa and continues to tour playing his father's music for appreciative audiences worldwide. Dweezil\u2019s proudest accomplishments are as father to his two daughters Zola Frank Zappa (born 2006) and Ceylon Indira Zappa (born 2008).

Now Chicagoans, their rhythmic, soulful - and at times bilingual - Latinx punk songs are a reflection of their continent-spanning bond and proof that Divino Ni\u00f1o couldn\u2019t have formed without unlikely but happy coincidences.\n\nThe ten tracks on Foam feature wistfully romantic lyrics like the yearning plea on the title track (\u201cI really wanna run away with you\u201d), and sunny, honeyed arrangements. Songs like \u201cQuiero\u201d trade-off between English and Spanish with woozy guitars and harmonies anchoring the sweetness of the lyrics. The quartet\u2019s Latin American roots seep in throughout the LP\u2019s silky psychedelic flourishes but especially on single \u201cMaria,\u201d which is sung entirely in Spanish. Inspired in equal parts by Argentine punk and the narratives of Mexican telenovelas, the personality-filled track is one of the most memorable on the record.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9061397.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.413241, 37.771491], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Bootleg-ass-pop", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Slim's"}, {"Address": "650 Geary Street, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Night Terrors", "ArtistBio": "www.nightterrorsband.com Blue Island, IL USA pop-punk. www.nightterrorsband.com", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8110325.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.414033, 37.787047], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Punk, Emo, Pop Punk", "OtherInfo": "Join the Darling Misfits for an '80s slumber party that goes horribly wrong as the guests start dying in horrific ways.

His forthcoming 16th studio album, \"What Happens Next\" (due out Jan 12, 2018), is already picking up rave reviews as yet another creative breakthrough \u2013 this for a guitarist who has routinely topped guitar magazine polls since the release of his first full-length album, \"Not Of This Earth\", in 1986.\n\nSince September 18, 1970 (the day his idol Jimi Hendrix passed away), Satriani has dedicated himself to the artistry of the instrument. While still a teenager in his hometown of Westbury, New York, he taught guitar to another budding six-string hopeful, Steve Vai. A few years later, Satriani moved to San Francisco and played guitar in a popular new wave band, The Squares, and briefly joined The Greg Kihn Band before the release of \"Not Of This Earth\".\n\nSatriani\u2019s reputation was already growing in guitar circles \u2013 along with Vai, some of his other students were Metallica\u2019s Kirk Hammett and Testament\u2019s Alex Skolnick \u2013 but in 1987, he broke through to the masses with his second studio full-length, \"Surfing With The Alien\", a massive seller (it hit No. 29 on the Billboard 200) that included the radio hits \u201cSatch Boogie\u201d and the title track. The success of that album caught the attention of Mick Jagger, who asked Satriani to be his lead guitarist on his first-ever solo tour, in 1988.\n\nAs a live performer, Satriani has toured the world with each new release (his last concert tour for 2013\u2019s \"Unstoppable Momentum\" saw the guitarist touch down in 32 countries). In 1993, he joined Deep Purple as a temporary replacement for Ritchie Blackmore during a Japanese tour. In 1996, Satriani founded the multi-guitarist traveling experience called G3, which has seen him share stages with Vai, Eric Johnson, Yngwie Malmsteen, Robert Fripp, among others. And starting in 2009, Satriani traversed the globe again as a member of Chickenfoot. The all-star band (which also includes singer Sammy Hagar, former Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith) has issued two albums, their debut and 2011\u2019s follow-up, \"Chickenfoot III\".\n\nSatriani\u2019s solo discography includes a host of classics, including 1989\u2019s \"Flying In A Blue Dream\", \"The Extremist\" from 1992, \"Is There Love In Space?\" (2004) and 2010\u2019s \"Black Swans And Wormhole Wizards\". His 15 Grammy nominations have been for songs such as \u201cAlways With Me, Always With You,\u201d \u201cThe Crush Of Love,\u201d and \u201cSummer Song,\u201d as well as full albums like \"Surfing With The Alien\", \"The Extremist\" and \"Super Colossal\".\n\nSatriani has appeared in motion pictures such as Christopher Guest\u2019s 2006 release, \"For Your Consideration\", and the 2011 Brad Pitt starrer, \"Moneyball\". Through the years, he has designed and endorsed guitars, amplifiers and effects pedals for Ibanez, Marshall and Vox.

Embrace them as a national treasure.\n\n2014 brought the release of a new Walter Salas-Humara solo album, Curve and Shake. Rolling Stone editor Anthony DeCurtis describes the album - \u201cThat sense of being untethered from certainties, of floating, permeates Curve and Shake. The feeling is gentle, not quite scary, but with an element of unease. Letting go of expectations combines aspects of sadness, freedom and even wonder. Like so many great singers, Walter communicates as much by what he doesn\u2019t say as by what he does. His raspy tone provides a rich counterpoint to the genial surrealism, the offhand magical realism, of so many of his lyrics. His words are presented as if they\u2019re describing straightforward events, but they speak a rich, associative poetry that evokes emotions more so than facts. His guitar playing is similarly adaptable \u2013 raw and stinging one moment, dreamy and droning the next.\n\n2016 has brought the release of 2 new albums. Work: Part One, an acoustic rendering of Walter's best songs written in the 80s, is the first in a series of acoustic albums defining Walter as a singer/songwriter. It is produced by guitarist extraordinaire Richard Brotherton and includes familiar Silos Mary Rowell on violin and Amy Allison on supporting voice. Explodes and Disappears is an album of new songs, the follow up to Curve and Shake. Walter sings witty songs about modern life, rocks a sweet Spanish melody on guitar, swings a sexy jazz number, and then reaches deep for a soulful expression of values in a troubled world. He tops it all with a funky number chronicling 3 American misfits searching for peace of mind and headed for disaster on the shores of Mexico -- all skillfully blended into a seamless flow.\n\nWalter Salas-Humara has shared the stage with the following greats: Wilco, Lucinda Williams, Matthew Sweet, American Music Club, Chris Whitley, Hootie and The Blowfish, Violent Femmes, The Jayhawks, Yo La Tengo, Certain General, The Reivers, The True Believers, The Wild Seeds, Victoria Williams, Willard Grant Conspiracy, Mark Ribot, Ryan Adams, Jon Dee Graham, Alejandro Escovedo, Let's Active, Young Fresh Fellows, Miracle Legion, Living Color, Souled American, The Minus 5, Steve Wynn and the Miracle 3, Jon Langford, The Waco Brothers, Chuck Prophet, Jerry Joseph, Caitlin Cary, Anders Parker, Tom Freund, Centro-Matic, Spottiswoode and his Enemies, Lynyrd Skynyrd, \u2026to name a few.\n\nVISUAL ARTS\n\nHaving first moved to New York in 1982 to pursue a career in the visual arts, and having completed a year of graduate work at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, Salas-Humara found steady work with the Leo Castelli Gallery during the \u201880s Manhattan art boom. Citing as his heroes \u201850s minimalist painter Ellsworth Kelly and Pop artist Jasper Johns, Salas-Humara\u2019s early paintings were primarily large abstract color fields. His art career was cut short with the success of the Silos three years later.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Salas-Humara took up painting again after a hiatus of two decades. On a whim, he created several stylized, cartoon-like dog paintings as holiday gifts for his nieces and nephews. They became so popular that he was soon spending much of his free time painting commissioned dog portraits in his signature style for friends and fans. In 2005, he formed a company called WaltersDogs and began producing originals and prints for sale at shows, by mail-order and in music-oriented art galleries like Yard Dog in Austin, eventually expanding his product line to include apparel, accessories, bedding and stationery products.\n\n\u201cI create paintings that combine qualities of the abstract art I like with fun imagery that anybody can relate to, even kids,\u201d he says.\n\nHis dog paintings can be seen on the walls of Elisabeth Moss\u2019s apartment in the 2010 Universal Pictures comedy Get Him to the Greek.\n\nRELATED WEBSITES\nWSH - waltersalashumara.com\nThe Silos - thesilos.net\nWaltersDogs - waltersdogs.com\nWalter Salas-Humara Wiki", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8502444.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.415112, 37.771141], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Americana, Singer, Songwriter, Alternative, Alternative Country-Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Willows"}, {"Address": "2025 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Jimi Hendrix", "ArtistBio": "Widely recognized as one of the most creative and influential musicians of the 20th century, Jimi Hendrix pioneered the explosive possibilities of the electric guitar. Hendrix's innovative style of combining fuzz, feedback and controlled distortion created a new musical form. Because he was unable to read or write music, it is nothing short of remarkable that Jimi Hendrix's meteoric rise in the music took place in just four short years. His musical language continues to influence a host of modern musicians, from George Clinton to Miles Davis, and Steve Vai to Jonny Lang.\n\nJimi Hendrix, born Johnny Allen Hendrix at 10:15 a.m. on November 27, 1942, at Seattle's King County Hospital, was later renamed James Marshall by his father, James \"Al\" Hendrix. Young Jimmy (as he was referred to at the time) took an interest in music, drawing influence from virtually every major artist at the time, including B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Holly, and Robert Johnson. Entirely self-taught, Jimmy's inability to read music made him concentrate even harder on the music he heard.\n\nAl took notice of Jimmy's interest in the guitar, recalling, \"I used to have Jimmy clean up the bedroom all the time while I was gone, and when I would come home I would find a lot of broom straws around the foot of the bed. I'd say to him, `Well didn't you sweep up the floor?' and he'd say, `Oh yeah,' he did. But I'd find out later that he used to be sitting at the end of the bed there and strumming the broom like he was playing a guitar.\" Al found an old one-string ukulele, which he gave to Jimmy to play a huge improvement over the broom.\n\nBy the summer of 1958, Al had purchased Jimmy a five-dollar, second-hand acoustic guitar from one of his friends. Shortly thereafter, Jimmy joined his first band, The Velvetones. After a three-month stint with the group, Jimmy left to pursue his own interests. The following summer, Al purchased Jimmy his first electric guitar, a Supro Ozark 1560S; Jimi used it when he joined The Rocking Kings.\n\nIn 1961, Jimmy left home to enlist in the United States Army and in November 1962 earned the right to wear the \"Screaming Eagles\" patch for the paratroop division. While stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Jimmy formed The King Casuals with bassist Billy Cox. After being discharged due to an injury he received during a parachute jump, Jimmy began working as a session guitarist under the name Jimmy James. By the end of 1965, Jimmy had played with several marquee acts, including Ike and Tina Turner, Sam Cooke, the Isley Brothers, and Little Richard. Jimmy parted ways with Little Richard to form his own band, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, shedding the role of back-line guitarist for the spotlight of lead guitar.\n\nThroughout the latter half of 1965, and into the first part of 1966, Jimmy played the rounds of smaller venues throughout Greenwich Village, catching up with Animals' bassist Chas Chandler during a July performance at Cafe Wha? Chandler was impressed with Jimmy's performance and returned again in September 1966 to sign Hendrix to an agreement that would have him move to London to form a new band.\n\nSwitching gears from bass player to manager, Chandler's first task was to change Hendrix's name to \"Jimi.\" Featuring drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, the newly formed Jimi Hendrix Experience quickly became the talk of London in the fall of 1966.\n\nThe Experience's first single, \"Hey Joe,\" spent ten weeks on the UK charts, topping out at spot No. 6 in early 1967. The debut single was quickly followed by the release of a full-length album Are You Experienced, a psychedelic musical compilation featuring anthems of a generation. Are You Experienced has remained one of the most popular rock albums of all time, featuring tracks like \"Purple Haze,\" \"The Wind Cries Mary,\" \"Foxey Lady,\" \"Fire,\" and \"Are You Experienced?\"\n\nAlthough Hendrix experienced overwhelming success in Britain, it wasn't until he returned to America in June 1967 that he ignited the crowd at the Monterey International Pop Festival with his incendiary performance of \"Wild Thing.\" Literally overnight, The Jimi Hendrix Experience became one of most popular and highest grossing touring acts in the world.\n\nHendrix followed Are You Experienced with Axis: Bold As Love. By 1968, Hendrix had taken greater control over the direction of his music; he spent considerable time working the consoles in the studio, with each turn of a knob or flick of the switch bringing clarity to his vision.\n\nBack in America, Jimi Hendrix built his own recording studio, Electric Lady Studios in New York City. The name of this project became the basis for his most demanding musical release, a two LP collection, Electric Ladyland. Throughout 1968, the demands of touring and studio work took its toll on the group and in 1969 the Experience disbanded.\n\nThe summer of 1969 brought emotional and musical growth to Jimi Hendrix. In playing the Woodstock Music & Art Fair in August 1969, Jimi joined forces with an eclectic ensemble called Gypsy Sun & Rainbows featuring Jimi Hendrix, Mitch Mitchell, Billy Cox, Juma Sultan, and Jerry Velez. The Woodstock performance was highlighted by the renegade version of \"Star Spangled Banner,\" which brought the mud-soaked audience to a frenzy.\n\nNineteen sixty-nine also brought about a new and defining collaboration featuring Jimi Hendrix on guitar, bassist Billy Cox and Electric Flag drummer Buddy Miles. Performing as the Band of Gypsys, this trio launched a series of four New Year's performances on December 31, 1969 and January 1, 1970. Highlights from these performances were compiled and later released on the quintessential Band of Gypsys album in mid-1970 and the expanded Hendrix: Live At The Fillmore East in 1999.\n\nAs 1970 progressed, Jimi brought back drummer Mitch Mitchell to the group and together with Billy Cox on bass, this new trio once again formed The Jimi Hendrix Experience. In the studio, the group recorded several tracks for another two LP set, tentatively titled First Rays Of The New Rising Sun. Unfortunately, Hendrix was unable to see this musical vision through to completion due to his hectic worldwide touring schedules, then tragic death on September 18, 1970. Fortunately, the recordings Hendrix slated for release on the album were finally issued through the support of his family and original studio engineer Eddie Kramer on the 1997 release First Rays Of The New Rising Sun.\n\nFrom demo recordings to finished masters, Jimi Hendrix generated an amazing collection of songs over the course of his short career. The music of Jimi Hendrix embraced the influences of blues, ballads, rock, R&B, and jazz a collection of styles that continue to make Hendrix one of the most popular figures in the history of rock music.\n\n# # #", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9124434.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.268586, 37.809866], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Paramount Theatre"}, {"Address": "2181 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Sang Matiz", "ArtistBio": "Sang Matiz has been performing a collection of original and cover songs for 7 years, fusing energetic World and Afro-Brazilian/Peruvian beats with contemporary rhythms such as Pop, Jazz, and Funk.

Featuring the final lineup of cult noise-rock workhorses Fight Amp with the addition of vocalist Itarya Rosenberg of the late Legendary Divorce, LOW DOSE play heavy, grunge-tinged punk that is as visceral as it is infectious. Across their 35 minute, self-titled debut LP, the quartet bleed out ten emotionally fierce tracks, which deliver a loud/quiet/loud canvas for Rosenberg\u2019s lyrics to lay bare the heartbreak and raw nerves of a broken relationship amidst rumbling bass, screeching guitar tones and dynamic drums that together signal the end of the world. LOW DOSE will surely hit all the right notes for those who enjoy the more melodic side of noise rock \u2014especially fans of Metz, Unwound, Slint and early PJ Harvey.\n\n....\n\nPicture this: You\u2019ve just spent nearly a week in the hospital with a severe kidney infection only to find out your husband has cancelled your health insurance. On purpose. Because you finally left him for good\u2014because of his alcoholism. And his mistress.\n\nThat\u2019s the situation Itarya Rosenberg found herself in while she and her new bandmates\u2014Mike McGinnis, Jon DeHart and Dan Smith\u2014were in the studio recording Low Dose\u2019s self-titled debut. \u201cI had a 104-degree fever for two weeks,\u201d she says. \u201cI was sweating and shaking so bad. I recorded the first take of guitar tracks with a fever. So I went to urgent care thinking I could just get a prescription, but they were like, \u2018You\u2019re not leaving.\u2019\u201d\n\nEventually, Rosenberg got out of the hospital and the band finished the record. Then she began the slow, agonizing divorce process. \u201cIt took me months afterwards to realize it, but the cycle of abuse is fucking real,\u201d she says. \u201cI consider myself to be a pretty hard bitch\u2014I don\u2019t take shit from anyone\u2014but I could never imagine being treated the way I was treated or have the shit done to me that was done to me. And still, whenever I saw even a glimmer of the person I fell in love with, it was like, \u201cYeah, here I am. What do you need?\u2019\u201d\n\nRosenberg documents that cycle\u2014and all the hardship, emotional torment and manipulation that went along with it\u2014in her lyrics on Low Dose. The album details her tumultuous relationship with her ex-husband, who was also a member of Rosenberg\u2019s previous band, which was called\u2014wait for it\u2014Legendary Divorce. It\u2019s an irony that\u2019s not lost on the singer/guitarist. \u201cI know, right?\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cWhat\u2019s hilarious is that in Legendary Divorce, I sang about how solid he and I were.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that McGinnis (guitar/vocals) DeHart (bass/vocals) and Smith (drums)\u2014were all members of famed Philly sludge trio Fight Amp. \u201cWe pulled the plug on Fight Amp because we felt like it had run its course,\u201d McGinnis explains. \u201cWe liked the band still and we were all on good terms, but we just didn\u2019t wanna write another Fight Amp record. We wanted to branch out musically.\u201d\n\nAnd while there are some similarities between Fight Amp and Low Dose, one is definitely not the other. \u201cWe wanted to have different vocals and focus more on dynamics and melody,\u201d McGinnis offers. \u201cIf we tried to do that with Fight Amp, it would just come off as too different for people to like it. We still had good chemistry and got along, so we just wanted to find someone else to play with. Itarya was the obvious choice.\u201d\n\nMcGinnis, DeHart and Smith had all been friends with Rosenberg for years. In fact, Legendary Divorce played the final Fight Amp show. \u201cWe were always really big fans of her songwriting style and vocal delivery,\u201d McGinnis says. \u201cWe knew she was the right person for the music we wanted to play.\u201d\n\nDeHart called Rosenberg while her marital troubles were in full dumpster-fire mode. \u201cHe said they were starting a new project and wanted me involved,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was so fucking down, especially with all the shit going on in my life.\u201d\n\nAt first, joining forces with the Fight Amp guys made her personal situation worse. \u201cThings just completely snowballed and my ex was super resentful about me joining the band,\u201d she explains. \u201cIn fact, he drunkenly decided to break up Legendary Divorce at practice one day because I had joined this band.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the closing track on Low Dose is called \u201cLegendary Divorce.\u201d\n\u201cThat was super intentional,\u201d McGinnis says with a laugh. \u201cWe actually thought about calling the whole record that, but then we thought it was a little too heavy handed. We\u2019re not trying to smack anybody in the face or anything.\u201d\n\nLow Dose\u2019s 35-minute debut will hit all the right notes for those who enjoy the more melodic side of noise rock\u2014especially fans of Metz, Slint and early PJ Harvey. \u201cI feel like people who like Fight Amp will like this band, too,\u201d McGinnis offers. \u201cIn Fight Amp, we didn\u2019t play with dynamics too much. The volume was totally cranked and we were playing either really fast or slow, sludgy shit. It was loud and heavy. The riffs were melodic, but we were shouting the vocals. In Low Dose, the vocals are sung. Dynamically, there\u2019s stuff that Low Dose does that\u2019s really quiet. Fight Amp never went into that territory. I never used clean guitars in Fight Amp, but I do in Low Dose. We focus way more on harmony than we ever did in Fight Amp. It\u2019s just more musical, I think.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rosenberg\u2019s lyrics lay bare the heartbreak and raw nerves of a broken relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s about going through a really fucked up divorce, but I wanted to have the lyrics be very obvious and pop-sensible so people can apply them to things that they\u2019ve gone through personally,\u201d she says.\n\nIn the end, Low Dose is the sound of transcending your circumstances and moving on with your life. \u201cI\u2019m doing much better now,\u201d Rosenberg enthuses. \u201cPlaying with these guys and writing this record saved my life. It was so helpful and cathartic.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9232397.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.396415, 37.764922], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: Punk, Grunge, Noise-Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Bottom of the Hill"}, {"Address": "23 Petaluma Blvd N, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Robert Earl Keen", "ArtistBio": "Singer, songwriter, and entertainer, Robert Earl Keen, has recorded 19 albums and performed thousands of shows.

Even though they identify themselves mostly as indie pop, the band's main intention is for every member to freely write and compose, regardless of any influence or style. With all band members as active songwriters and composers, they describe themselves as \"all over the place\" but remain glued together by everyone's similar sound sensibilities.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, they released their first demo single \u2018On The Run\u2019 on Bandcamp, which fortunately found its way to the ears of Roque Ruiz of Cloudberry Records, as well as played on Scotland's \"Alan's Midweek Madhouse\" and college radio KDVS in Sacramento, California, where it was well received. They eventually completed their debut self-titled EP in late 2014, where it caught the attention of Maz Hadid of NYC Popfest, and landed a spot on NYC Popfest 2015 lineup opening for indie pop legend and one of the band's initial inspirations, Club 8. A very special moment indeed for the band as they were proud to be part of such a prestigious music festival that features the best in new and classic indie pop.\n\n\n\nAfter their performance at NYC Popfest, the band was introduced to Fastcut Records by fellow NYC Popfest performer and soon-to-be label mate Wallflower from Japan.

Not long after Ryan began learning how to play guitar, he joined a local rock band as the lead guitar player and entered various local battle of the bands contests. The first band he ever played in was \"Referral\". They entered into a contest a local classic rock radio station hosted by the famous Greg Kihn was putting on called The Last Band Standing. Ryan and his band ended up winning the contest in the 18/under category and got to play 5-6 songs live on air with Greg Kihn on his morning show. \"It felt surreal at only 14 yrs old being able to play live on the air with Greg Kihn for an audience of around a million people. It couldn't have been a better experience for me and the band\", Ryan recalls. At 16 years old, Ryan really began to find a love and passion for country music. \"I have some family who loved country music and it really just grew on me over time the more I was around it. You would think I would get sick of it from constantly hearing my family listening to it but it actually just made me love this genre of music even more.\" It wasn't until around the age of 18 years old that Ryan began to develop himself as a vocalist. \"I would bring my guitar to play at a friends bonfire and while I loved to play the guitar all night, I felt like there was something missing. I really wanted to start singing,\" Ryan recalls. At that point, Ryan had a grown passion for country music and began uploading videos to YouTube of himself singing and playing popular country songs. As Ryan began to progress and get better he wanted to take things to the next level and that was starting a country band. Now at the age of 23, Ryan has been playing regularly at various country bars across Northern California along with his band and strong female vocalist, Cece Bamburg. About one year ago, Ryan released his first EP to iTunes and Spotify titled as \"Ryan 'n' Cece\". The three song EP includes two originals written by Ryan and one cover song which were all produced by Ben Araiza of Def Moose Studios based out of San Jose, CA. Ryan is currently working on a brand new EP which will feature him as a solo artist. \"Music is my ultimate passion and you never know where it's going to take you. The most important aspect is that you gotta have fun with it and I feel so blessed to be able to do that on a regular basis.\"-Ryan I'm a country artist/musician from San Jose, CA.

Kids run across the boulevard as the soundtrack wafts over the streets. The few bucks forked over to the pregnant lady down on her luck could be the same notes used to cop a flavorful bouquet for a romantic conquest. The triggerman\u2019s itchy index is used both to spill rivals and thrill lovers. The Jack Moves are what this sounds like on wax.\n\nPainted by a sound reflective of the city\u2019s seaside soul, skate-funk punks and the Newark Jack Swing played from transistor radios and boom boxes placed on competitive window sills, The Jack Moves (Zee Desmondes, Teddy Powell) narrative is artfully carried out on the band\u2019s sophomore offering and Everloving debut, Free Money.\n\nAs with most art created in earnest, the band\u2019s music has the ability to occupy spaces beyond its origin city. A vehicle spanning coasts and subcultures, perhaps unintended. Out west, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to hear some Jack Moves ballad billowing from a lowrider during a backseat make-out session. Meanwhile in Japan, their hit song was hawking Big Macs\u2122 at Mickey Deeznuts. The band\u2019s self-titled Wax Poetics debut drew comparisons to \u201cOff the Wall\u201d era Michael Jackson, The Escorts and the Whatnauts. The Jack Moves then hit the road playing supporting dates, traveling the world. From Brixton Academy and Red Rocks Amphitheater, to the strange familiarity of the cherry blossomed avenues of Osaka and Tokyo.\n\nAnd so it should come as something of a surprise that The Jack Moves would record most of their latest material on the fringe of Los Angeles, placing their intrinsically east coast essence into the hands of idiot-shaman and occasional platinum record producer, JP Plunier. But way out west the music was unshackled and this new sound was soul, untethered from the chains of the past.\n\nFree Money twists and grooves, chugs and grinds, and sways \u2013 a modern, smashed-up hybrid devoid of nostalgic put-ons. Strangely enough this album could be the bastard child of The Stones \u201cSome Girls\u201d and Drake\u2019s \u201cMore Life\u201d. Underneath Powell\u2019s sepia toned soul rhythms, Desmondes\u2019 honeyed vocals sing incantations and love letters to unbelievers (\u201cPenn Station\u201d), lovers (\u201cSunshine,\u201d \u201cRed Lights\u201d), ancient beings (\u201cThree The Hard Way\u201d) and addicts \u2014 both digital and pharmaceutical (\u201cWantin\u2019 You,\u201d \u201cMoney Clouds\u201d) \u2014 all searching for something: a fix, a fuck, a dollar, a safe place, a friend, a home. Swipe left. Swipe right. Into a tangled void of fear and longing.\n\nThese are the songs young beat-choppers will be sampling in the post-millennial era.\n\nFor tour dates and more visit: thejackmoves.com\n\nPublicity Contact: Shazila Mohammed", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8850938.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.27003, 37.82567], "Date": "Fri Oct 4 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-04", "Genre": "Genres: R&B, soul, Funk, New Wave, Rockn Roll", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Eli's Mile High Club"}, {"Address": "1015 Folsom St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "AtYyA", "ArtistBio": "ATYYA - pronounced [ Ah-Tie-Ah ] is the musical project of Tyy Clark.

Disregarding all genres, he isn't afraid to push the boundaries of electronic bass and hip hop music.

Tsuruda made his Vancouver debut with Ekali and High Klassified in May, 2015, shortly after his legendary sunrise set at Emissions Music Festival with G Jones and Slow Magic. He's also no stranger in the Bay Area of California, holding down stages with Penthouse Penthouse, Sweater Beats, Zeke Beats, Mikos Da Gawd, Woolymammoth and many more.

The answer, my friend, is somewhere \u201cIn the Morse Code of Brake Lights,\u201d as The New Pornographers would have it on their eighth album. There\u2019s a deep climatic unease running through these 11 tracks that\u2019s matched only by the sheer musical glee with which the band addresses the prevailing mood of the moment. It\u2019s an album in which foreboding and bliss somehow go hand in hand\u2014mixing founder A.C. Newman\u2019s nearly symphonic levels of pop arrangement and harmony with a careening quality that feels unsafe at any speed (to quote the famous Ralph Nader phrase that the opening track also borrows).\n\n\u201cSometimes unintentional influences come in, and then after you start to notice them, you start consciously doing it,\u201d says Newman. \u201cI was about two-thirds of the way through the record when I began to notice that lyrically so much of it was pointing toward car songs. The opening track is \u2018You'll Need a Backseat Driver,\u2019 and that was a metaphor that seemed to be running through other songs, too. Next to the love song, I feel like the car song is one of the most iconic kinds of songs in pop music, from Chuck Berry to the present. There was so much of that throughout it that I started thinking: \u2018Oh, no, there\u2019s too many references to cars on this record!\u2019 And then I thought, no, that's good\u2014people might think it\u2019s a concept album,\u201d he laughs. \u201cLet\u2019s roll with that.\u201d\n\nBut Newman\u2019s automotive concerns are very different from Chuck Berry\u2019s, or Bruce Springsteen\u2019s. \u201cOf course, because I\u2019m a person with some degree of empathy and it\u2019s 2019, there couldn\u2019t help but be this sort of anger and panic at the state of the world that runs through everything,\u201d Newman says. \u201cAnd I think that lends itself to the car metaphor. We\u2019re in this vehicle and it doesn\u2019t stop moving and we don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going.\u201d In a time of heightened shared anxiety, maybe it\u2019s better not to know. \u201cI think it was Robert Louis Stevenson who said, \u2018Better to travel hopefully than to arrive\u2019\u2014which I basically paraphrase in the first chorus of the first song.\u201d\n\nThe New Pornographers have been road-worthy since their founding in 2000. But there\u2019s no mistaking that, with In the Morse Code of Brake Lights (their second release for Concord, following 2017\u2019s Whiteout Conditions), what has long been referred to as a \u201csupergroup\u201d has actually coalesced into something like, you know, an actual group\u2014one with a regular, solidified lineup, the presence of someone as independently famous as Neko Case as co-lead vocalist notwithstanding.\n\nNewman is doing all the songwriting now, save for a few lines contributed by former (and possibly future) member Dan Bejar. Drummer Joe Seiders is into his second album with the group, and you\u2019ll notice his presence on the kit especially in the opening couple of tracks. \u201cIf there was any song that had the biggest influence on us in terms of its drumming, it's \u2018Dreaming\u2019 by Blondie,\u201d Newman says. \u201cI always loved that that song is essentially a drum solo, and at times we do that.\u201d His niece is a greater instrumental presence this time: \u201cIn terms of keyboards, this record has such a Kathryn Calder stamp. There was a point where she started playing this part on \u2018Solomon\u2019 and I feel like it just changed the record. When I heard what she did with it, I said, \u2018Do this on every song.\u2019\u201d Longtime touring member Simi Stone is participating on record for the first time, as well.\n\nAt the same time, Newman is also sharpening his auteur chops a little by taking over as sole producer. Bassist John Collins, his usual co-producer, \u201cwas having a kid, and that coincided with me becoming a lot more savvy in the studio,\u201d Newman says. \u201cJohn was always the guy who was doing a lot of the audio manipulation and messing with arpeggiators and echoes, and I was always the guy standing behind him going, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s cool. Let's do more of that.\u2019 On this record it ended up that I was the guy doing it and the guy going, \u2018That\u2019s cool. Let\u2019s make sure we don't lose it.\u2019 So that to me was the big difference. And it was very fun. Although I had to be careful not to spend too much time with myself, because you can just descend into madness.\u201d\n\nThe New Pornographers still remain one of the few bands of any significance to employ multiple lead vocalists\u2014a province usually left to obscure and un-influential little bands like the Beatles, so you can see why it never caught on much. \u201cIf you listen to this record, it has slightly more Neko than usual,\u201d Newman points out. \u201cBut I didn't really think of the balance as much this time around. Especially when Dan was singing on the records, how much to use each singer was always on my mind, in the sequencing and in general. And on this record, I didn\u2019t really care at all. I thought, if it\u2019s almost all me, then so be it, or if it\u2019s more Neko, then so be it\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s just the way the music industry has changed\u2014in that it's going off in directions that we don\u2019t even understand\u2014that when I\u2019m making a record, I think, why even guess what the right thing to do is? Just do it, whatever makes sense to you.\u201d\n\nThese questions do come up, even as the lineup finally stabilizes. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked the idea of the Pornographers kind of morphing as we go along,\u201d Newman says. \u201cWhen we put out the first record, I didn't think of the reality of what are we going to do if this thing becomes popular? I used to joke around that I wanted it to be a computer program that you could feed songs through and they would come out the other side as The New Pornographers, and it didn\u2019t necessarily matter who was in the band. But then a weird thing happened where people in the band became semi-famous. And then my dream of being the Alan Parsons Project, with everyone being faceless, went up in smoke. There\u2019s too many people with personalities in this band,\u201d he jokes, knowing that, even as an \u201cI Robot\u201d fan, that\u2019s not such a bad problem to have.\n\nWhen Whiteout Conditions came out two years ago, Newman openly acknowledged the Jeff Lynne influence, along with the simultaneous addition of a kraut-rock pulse. This time it was less about Lynne\u2019s influence on the synth stacking than on actual strings, with the quartet Strength of Materials playing parts written and arranged by Newman\u2019s fellow Canadian Ford Pier. \u201cThere are about four songs on the record that are fairly string heavy, and I didn\u2019t want them to sound like your average strings,\u201d says Newman. \u201cIf they were going to sound like anything, I wanted them to sound like ELO, because I will always love ELO. It\u2019s an influence I will never be embarrassed about. We use a string quartet that was doubled\u2014which I think is the early ELO method, before he could afford entire orchestras.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the entire record feels ornate, by any stretch of the hard-driving indie-pop-rock-and-roll imagination. Even as Newman was considering how to add strings onto some of the songs, he was thinking about how to strip others further back.\n\n\u201cThe influences that made us do Whiteout Conditions felt like a natural progression, and those are still with us,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was also wanting to do songs that felt more like a throwback to older songs we used to play. The second song on the record, \u2018The Surprise Knock,\u2019 had a different feel when we first recorded it\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t mind releasing that version at some point. But as I was listening to it, I thought, \u2018Why don\u2019t we play this song like New Pornographers 2005?\u2019 Then we just replayed it with that feel. I thought enough time has passed that I feel like I can play songs that sort of sound like a classic Pornographers sound and not feel like I\u2019m repeating myself, because it\u2019s been so long. That was definitely a part of it: just wanting to\u2026I hate to say \u2018get back,\u2019 but just get more slightly raucous and sounding more like a band.\u201d\n\nThe track \u201cYou Won\u2019t Need Those Where You\u2019re Going\u201d definitely doesn\u2019t sound like a band, because it\u2019s just Newman and a piano, an approach he modeled with the simplicity of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cShelter from the Storm\u201d in mind. But that, too, felt reminiscent of a previous period in the Pornographers\u2019 oeuvre. \u201cThat felt like a throwback to something like Twin Cinema, which I think was the first record where we really branched out and just decided that we can do whatever we want, and we get to decide what a Pornographers song is or what it sounds like.\u201d\n\nLyrically, no one will accuse In the Morse Code of Brake Lights of simplicity, with its fantastic rushes of wordplay. He\u2019s the first to admit that this isn\u2019t just a \u201ccars\u201d album, but that there are mixed metaphors everywhere. It\u2019s the way he works, as he tries to cloak the blatant social and political statements he might make in interviews or on Twitter in a language that is both wittier and ultimately more mystical.\n\n\u201cThere is so much politics that runs through all the lyrics, and it\u2019s inescapable,\u201d he says. \u201cI try not to constantly go on about it, but it\u2019s a very scary time. I try not to be too explicit, and I\u2019m going to try to make it a little more wrapped up in metaphor and playing with the sound of words. Sometimes I do wonder to myself, is this completely inscrutable, or just completely too straightforward? In a song like \u2018Colossus of Rhodes,\u2019 the lyrics are very much about this time. I began to think of the Colossus of Rhodes as this metaphor for America, like the eighth wonder of the world, and nobody knows quite what happened to it, but it fell. The fear is that we\u2019re kind of at the end of the American Empire. I read the news and try and piece everything together, and more and more I can\u2019t see a way out of this, there's nothing to go back to. We can\u2019t go back to 2008 or 2009 and everybody\u2019s excited because Obama won, because those eight years caused something to become very rabid. But I don\u2019t want to write the \u2018I hate Trump\u2019 song\u2014even though I wish somebody would. I\u2019m worried that the kind of song I write, unlike hip-hop or something, might make that message seem less serious or more flippant, so I try to be a little bit more obscure.\n\n\u201cThe question is, is it acceptable in this day and age to be an artist who has no opinion, or who says, \u2018Oh, I just want to have fun and entertain people\u2019? I think of World War II, where there were these songs that were there just to entertain people, like \u2018Ain\u2019t We Got Fun\u2019\u2014light music so people could have fun, because it was not a fun time and they needed something to distract them. But now we have nothing but distraction. Now we have a thousand times the distractions we had in World War II, and I think, do I really want to add to them? It makes you think about pompous things like the role of the artist in society.\u201d\n\nIt comes out in songs like \u201cWe\u2019re Gonna Need Some Giants,\u201d which is \u201cjust about the politics of right now. You want somebody to come save us\u2014or the Mueller report is going to save us!\u2014but you realize nobody\u2019s going to come save us.\u201d The title of that song came about when Newman was playing a tape backward and heard himself singing what sounded like the title phrase. He then fashioned that into a song and had Caldwell sing those words\u2014forwards\u2014over his backwards version.\n\nThe first single, \u201cFalling Down the Stairs of Your Smile,\u201d has both light and serious origins. \u201cThere are so many songs like \u2018the something of love\u2019\u2014you know, there\u2019s \u2018The Book of Love,\u2019 \u2018The Freeway of Love\u2019\u2026Then I thought of \u2018falling down the stairs of your love,\u2019 and I thought, that kind of works. I think it has that element of how do you deal with the ideas of love and happiness in this world right now? When current events are stressful, that makes a stress on people\u2019s relationships, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how to be happy in this loving relationship in this world that seems ugly at every turn, which is not as easy as it seems. Of course, \u2018love\u2019 ultimately morphed into \u2018smile,\u2019 but I like the metaphor of love as something that you fall down.\u201d\n\nFalling, or imminent crashing\u2026it\u2019s all related in The New Pornographer\u2019s \u201cMorse Code\u201d worldview. But there is more than one interpretation to many of the songs, as Newman points out with \u201cYou Won\u2019t Need Those Where You\u2019re Going,\u201d the emancipating title of which could portend either fleeing into the arms of a freeing love or doom. \u201cIt can be both, you know,\u201d he points out. \u201cI like that ambivalence. And considering I start each line with \u2018my love,\u2019 I guess it's a love song. Just because you have found a love doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not doomed, and just because you\u2019re doomed doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t find love.\u201d\n\nIn the end, for all its automotive motifs, In the Morse Code of Brake Lights is the opposite of something like a traditional rock & roll \u201cThunder Road.\u201d But for Newman, there is catharsis is in the traveling, even if there is no exit. \u201cThe longer I play music,\u201d he says, \u201cI realize how much just defiance there is in all the music I've always made. Not just against some societal injustice, but also just defying sadness, or defying your lot in life. I want to use music to get to a better place, which is what I\u2019ve always done, I realize. It\u2019s a way to reach out of yourself.\u201d The album may not offer an escape from these sometimes terrifying modern times, but it\u2019s a hell of a revivifying rest stop.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9171801.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Alternative", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "11:00 AM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "3038 Fulton St., San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "Hot Buttered Rum", "ArtistBio": "\u201cStunning instrumental and vocal virtuosity.\u201d \u2013 Relix Magazine\n\n\u201cFew things rejuvenate the soul like a warm fireside drink after an exhausting day in the snow.

Their original songs are instantly familiar and inviting, and their easygoing versions of timeless classics (the Beatles, Hank Williams) belie the intricacy of the arrangements.\u201d \u2013San Francisco Chronicle\n\nHot Buttered Rum lives for a good time, and a mindful recklessness settles in whenever these five guys step on stage. From Anchorage to Miami, the group\u2019s onstage chemistry fuels the lovefest that is a live Butter show. Rooted in the trajectory of west coast bluegrass, Hot Buttered Rum plays what has been described as California\u2019s own acoustic music.\n\nHBR\u2019s years of touring have given the band the chance to work and play with a wide cross-section of musicians, people like Peter Rowan, Phil Lesh, Chris Thile, Brett Dennen, and Robert Earl Keen. Seasoned veteran Steve Berlin (Los Lobos), acoustic guru Mike Marshall, and left-coast rocker Tim Bluhm (Mother Hips, Nicki Bluhm) have all produced studio albums for the band. Each guided HBR towards the next step in its evolution. It\u2019s a sound that is tough to describe and easy to love, and it has found its way to the most prestigious pop, folk, and bluegrass stages in the country: Telluride, Newport, Bonnaroo, Strawberry, Hardly Strictly, Kate Wolf, Horning\u2019s Hideout, String Summit, Grey Fox, Merlefest, All Good, High Sierra, Wakarusa, and many more.\n\nThe next step in Butter\u2019s evolution involves recording three 6-song EPs, each focusing on a part of music that Hot Buttered Rum loves and is inspired by, and each with a different producer. The first EP was recently recorded with Railroad Earth\u2019s Tim Carbone and will be released this fall. The second will be a collection of Ralph Stanley old school bluegrass standards, to be recorded in September with producer Sally Van Meter. The third will be Hot Buttered Rum\u2019s latenight throwdown music, to be recorded in November with SCI\u2019s Kyle Hollingsworth. Together, the three collections of songs will explore Butter\u2019s roots and express Butter\u2019s present passions.\n\nAt the center of Hot Buttered Rum is the enduring camaraderie of old friends. The band was conceived on a backpacking trip of high school and college buddies in the High Sierra.

Pulling from lead guitarist and singer Brian J\u2019s deep discography of influences, the creation of Jukestone Paradise began a decade ago, when he penned anthems like \u201cSky\u201d and \u201cFreedom Dancer,\u201d all the way up to the album\u2019s studio recording sessions.\n\nYou might accurately call the Pimps of Joytime a \u2018post-genre\u2019 band; they\u2019re a group whose sound\u2014even within a single song\u2014mirrors the diversity of our era\u2019s musical tastes. \u201cIt\u2019s a sonic tapestry that\u2019s representative of this time and place that we live in,\u201d says Brian J.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Pimps excel, by mashing up \u201870s funk tones with modern dance beats, mixed with original samples creating their mosaic sound. For listeners weary of today\u2019s DJ culture but eager to dance with abandon, the Pimps of Joytime are the antidote.\n\n\u201cAt our core, the Pimps of Joytime are not just dance music,\u201d says Brian J of the band\u2019s three-part harmony attack. \u201cMy first vocal mentor was a doo-wop singer, so I have a long-time love affair with vocal harmonies.\u201d\n\nWith the release of Jukestone Paradise, the band makes official their solid touring lineup, featuring dual female vocalists and percussionists Mayteana Morales and Cole WilliamsX. And they\u2019re hitting the road hard, continuing a constant touring schedule that\u2019s already left prominent sets at festivals like Voodoo, Outside Lands, Bonnaroo and High Sierra in their wake.\n\nBehind the frontlines are bassist/keyboardist David Bailis and drummer John Staten, forming the rhythmic backbone of the Pimps\u2019 audible collage.

Todd Snider notably hand-delivered a gift on-stage, and Chuck Norris has sent fan mail. His fifth full-length album, No Rain, No Rose boasted two collaborations with Gregory Alan Isakov, namely \u201cI Am California\u201d and \u201cHighway Blood.\u201d Both quickly cracked One Million Spotify streams and counting, as his knack for a captivating narrative and rustic aural palettes powered the 13-track offering together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about transparency,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe storytelling enables listeners to relate. Really good music doesn\u2019t make you feel good; it makes you feel like you\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nAs No Rain, No Rose landed, he caught the attention of none other than Jack Johnson. Through a serendipitous series of events, Craigie\u2019s 2016 live effort Capricorn in Retrograde\u2026 Just Kidding\u2026 Live in Portland landed in Johnson\u2019s car stereo during a California coastal road trip.\n\nShortly after, Jack reached out and Craigie soon found himself onstage for 12 shows during Johnson\u2019s 2017 summer tour including performances at The Greek Theatre in Berkeley, California and The Gorge in Washington state.

Longtime members Paul Janeway (lead vocals), Jesse Phillips (bass, guitar), Browan Lollar (guitars), Andrew Lee (drums), Al Gamble (keyboards), and Allen Branstetter (trumpet) are joined by Jason Mingledorff (saxophone, clarinet, flute), and Chad Fisher (trombone).\n\nThe collection of new original songs is the group\u2019s first release on RECORDS, a joint venture of SONGS Publishing, winner of ASCAP\u2019s 2016 independent publisher of the year award, and veteran label executive Barry Weiss.\n\nSea of Noise is a successor to the Broken Bones\u2019 2013 debut album Half the City, which introduced the group\u2019s blazing mating of \u201860s soul fire \u2013 daubed with latter-day influences like Sly Stone, David Bowie, and Prince -- to Janeway\u2019s impassioned singing and writing. The new album witnesses a deepening and broadening of the unit\u2019s musical reach and lyrical concerns.\n\n\u201cIt felt like it happened organically,\u201d Janeway says of the band\u2019s development. \u201cWith the last record, it was like doing things with your hair on fire \u2013 going in, recording it live. There\u2019s a sense of urgency to having a record like that. We were only a band for about five months at that point. I didn\u2019t know my voice \u2013 I\u2019d never done this professionally. I was just learning more nuance, and about carrying a melody. You don\u2019t have to go for it 100% all the time. You can draw people in by giving and taking.\u201d\n\nJaneway says that he and his close musical associate Phillips began to ponder the direction of the band\u2019s second album a year and a half ago. \u201cIf we had been forced to go into a studio a year and a half ago, we probably would have done a better version of Half the City,\u201d he says. \u201cThere would have been nothing wrong with that. But we started evolving, or changing.\u201d\n\nWork began in earnest during last year\u2019s Coachella festival in California: \u201cWe rented a house in San Bernardino Valley National Park. The week in between the two weekends, we really started to hash things out. Then we rented out a very hot warehouse in Birmingham where we could write. And me and Jesse and a few of us would send stuff back and forth via Dropbox. That gave me the ability to work on harmonies on the vocals. I wanted to take it up a notch, in all realms.\u201d\n\nLooking to such inspirations as Tom Waits and Nick Cave, Janeway was intent on lifting his game as a songwriter on material for the second album. \u201cI\u2019m married to a woman with a masters in literature, and I can\u2019t show her lyrics unless I\u2019m pretty proud of \u2018em,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to sit and think about what I\u2019m saying \u2013 what do I want to say, is there anything to say? What\u2019s my perspective as this Southern kid who\u2019s watching the modern world and feeling very much like an alien in a lot of ways. This is more personal. If you\u2019re going to say something, say something, and don\u2019t waste your breath unless you feel like you\u2019re saying something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nJaneway adds that his reading of the book Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, played a role in the direction of the work: \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be an overly political record, but I feel it shows up a little bit on the album.\u201d\n\nWith a full complement of new songs in hand, St. Paul and the Broken Bones entered the studio with Butler, leader of the British band the Bees and producer of Devendra Banhart and Michael Kiwanuka.\n\n\u201cJesse was listening to one of his records and he said, \u2018Everything sounds great,\u2019\u201d Janeway recalls. \u201cIt sounded like a real record \u2013 everything had depth, and was expansive-sounding. Butler ended up being the guy that we wanted to use. Producer-wise, I think we knocked a home run. He is very meticulous.\u201d\n\nOn Sea of Noise, the band\u2019s brawny horn-driven sound is augmented \u2013 and displaced -- by the use of a string quartet and a vocal choir. The strings \u2013 recorded at Memphis\u2019 historic Sam Phillips Recording by engineer Jeff Powell \u2013 were arranged by Lester Snell, a veteran of Stax Records sessions by Isaac Hayes, Shirley Brown, Albert King, and the Staple Singers, among many others. Janeway says of Snell, \u201cHe did all these classic, great records in Memphis \u2013 he did the string arrangements on them. The strings, for us, supply a darker tone. Horns sometimes can\u2019t portray a certain darkness. We thought that would be the best option, instead of horn lines. We have songs on this record that don\u2019t have any horns at all.\u201d\n\nEmployed on \u201cCrumbling Light Posts,\u201d the recurring motif that appears three times on the album, Jason Clark and the Tennessee Mass Choir were recorded in another legendary Memphis facility. \u201cThe Stax Museum let us go in there after hours and record the choir,\u201d Janeway says, adding with a laugh. \u201cWe said, \u2018Well, hell, we\u2019re in Memphis, let\u2019s just see if they\u2019ll do it.\u2019 It was pretty neat, I\u2019m not gonna lie.\u201d\n\nHe says of the finished work, \u201cSea of Noise is not quite a full-blown concept record. It is focused in terms of subject matter \u2013 finding redemption and salvation and hope. \u2018Crumbling Light Posts\u2019 comes from an old Winston Churchill quote, in which he said England was a crumbling lighthouse in a sea of darkness. I always thought that was a really interesting concept \u2013 that we\u2019re falling anyway. In this day and age, it is the noise that has defined so many things. We\u2019re going to fall to it eventually, but for now we feel like our heads are above water. It felt anthemic.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s lyrical and emotional richness is heard loudly in stunning new compositions like \u201cBurning Rome\u201d (which Janeway describes as \u201ca letter to God, if I could write it\u201d) and the startling \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Woman,\u201d which knocks traditional soul music gender roles on their heads. Janeway says of the latter song, \u201cI wrote that with Jesse, and he said, \u2018If I can write that song, I can die a happy man, because I\u2019ve finally made something that I feel can stand up to my standards.\u2019\u201d\n\nSt. Paul and the Broken Bones, which toured extensively in the U.S. and Europe behind their debut album, will put their take-no-prisoners live show on the road this fall. Their most recent concert work included arena dates opening for the Rolling Stones in Atlanta and Buffalo. Some acts may have been daunted by such a task, but not this one.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty neat, it was pretty crazy,\u201d Janeway says. \u201cI love the Rolling Stones, but my train of thought it, you gotta try and blow \u2018em off the stage. And that\u2019s still my goal.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8757676.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, R&B, Rock n Roll", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "588 E Alma Ave, San Jose, CA 95112", "Artist": "Haley & Michaels", "ArtistBio": "New single \"Taking Off\" is available everywhere!", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9049182.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.86316, 37.319693], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "Genres: Country", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "San Jose Giants Excite Ballpark"}, {"Address": "Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94116", "Artist": "Jared Tyler", "ArtistBio": "Tulsa, OK March 14th, 2017\u2014There is a line from Jared Tyler\u2019s bio that puts his career into perspective\u2014\u201cThere is no best way to introduce Jared Tyler. He\u2019s too many things.\u201d Still in his 30\u2019s the artist has accomplished so much in a short span of time. Playing Dobro with Malcolm Holcombe since 1999, he has also worked with many artists and bands such as Emmylou Harris, Merle Haggard, Wilco, fellow Okie John Moreland in a recording capacity or as a supporting act. As a producer he has worked with Jesse Aycock, Jimmy LaFave, Monica Taylor and Malcolm Holcombe, among others.\n\n\n\nDirt on Your Hands is Tyler\u2019s 3rd solo record. He made his national debut in 2006 with Blue Alleluia (Produced by the legendary Russ Titelman) and followed up with Here with You in 2010 (co-produced with Chuck Zwicky who was the mixing engineer for Prince). Dirt on Your Hands was co-produced with Nashville bassist, Dave Roe who also plays on the record. This recent solo project has allowed for Tyler to collaborate dear friends and incredibly talented people with players and guest spots from John Fullbright, Malcolm Holcombe, Kenny Vaughn, and Jellyroll Johnson to name a few.\n\n\n\nAlready growing crowds in Tulsa and with a listening audience nationwide, Tyler is set to expand his audience with Dirt on Your Hands. Written as a nod to his roots and community, the record is the most Americana/roots sounding project that he has ever released as an artist. Described as World beat Americana Soul Tyler\u2019s music straddles many genres including folk, blues, bluegrass, country, gospel, red dirt and soul without losing focus on the songwriting and Tyler\u2019s voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a lover of songs telling honest stories of love and loss on this path of human existence,\u201d said Tyler. \u201cThe songs I write or interpret are dear to my heart telling the stories of my life experiences. My hope in sharing these songs is that they would strike a chord in others that have gone through similar experiences or have felt the same way- somehow making them feel a little better.\u201d\n\n\n\nA longtime fan of Malcolm Holcombe before he began playing with him, Tyler covers two of his songs, \u201cDressed in White\u201d and \u201cThe Door\u201d and covers friend, Dixie Michell\u2019s song \u201cWaltzing Around With My Shadow\u201d. Tyler wrote 4 of the songs on the record and shares writing credit on 5 of the songs.\n\n\n\nThe 12-song album kicks it off with \u201cDeath of Me\u201d a song encouraged by dear friend and luthier, Dixie Mitchell (who has since passed) and written for his life partner, Jacob Mehlhouse. \u201c[Dixie] had showed me a lick on the guitar that I believe might\u2019ve been in an old Chet Atkins song and I just loved it,\u201d explained Tyler. \u201cI twisted it around within a few minutes started scatting with my own melody and Dixie said that it sounded like a hit.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe title song \u201cDirt on Your Hands\u201d was inspired by Tyler\u2019s memory of his grandma\u2019s compost pile and the worms they used to dig out for fishing in the neighborhood pond. Co-written with Monty Holmes (who wrote \u201cwhen did you stop lovin\u2019 me\u201d and \u201cTroubadour\u201d for George Strait, and \u201cNever again, Again\u201d for LeAnn Womack), the song felt like a \u201cpower song\u201d for Tyler\u2014\u201cI felt like the message for this song perfectly summed up this collection of songs, so I made it the title track of the record.\u201d\n\n\n\nJared Tyler\u2019s grandfather who was a fiddle and mandolin player is credited with putting a tater bug mandolin in Tyler\u2019s hands at 6 years old when he taught him 3 chords. \u201cLucky Man\u201d is the song that brings to mind his grandfather\u2019s advice, \u201cIf you can count your friends on one hand, you\u2019re a lucky man.\u201d \u201cMusically I wrote this song on a mandolin with a more bluegrass feel to it, but in the studio we just went with the moment, and it turned out a little more of a red dirt rockin\u2019 vibe,\u201d he explains.\n\n\n\nTyler finishes up the album with \u201cLove of You\u201d, a personal love song. \u201cOne night while Malcolm was visiting Tulsa for a few shows, we were sitting outside talking and I had a ukulele I was plucking on,\u201d said Tyler. \u201cThere was a half a moon in the sky and a bright star (probably a planet) right next to it. I started singing the first line of the song, and Malcolm said there you go - there\u2019s a song. I roughed out the idea, and then played it for Jamie Kindleyside in Dickson, TN. He helped me simplify it even more, and articulate what I was really trying to say. In it\u2019s almost nursery rhyme form - my true feelings were conveyed. I would usually be too shy to ever put out a song like this one, but it was from such a deep place of love that I knew it needed to be on here. I love how the two songs written to Jacob start and end the cd.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs a special note, Tyler\u2019s friend, Dixie was, as mentioned, a luthier. She was world-renowned for making acoustic instruments under her company name, Guitar Company of America. Due to their masterful tone Tyler made a point to feature her instruments as much as possible on the record. Tyler plays her hand made Nick Lucas-style guitars on \u201cDeath of Me,\u201d \u201cWaltzing Around with my shadow,\u201d \u201cHeart Wide Open,\u201d \u201cGwendolyn,\u201d and \u201cNorway\u201d and a mandolin she made on \u201cWaltzing around with my shadow\u201d and on \u201cLucky I Am.\u201d\n\n\n\nJared Tyler\u2019s diversity of sound is the standout for this record. Comfortable in large settings including Ryman Auditorium and Cain\u2019s Ballroom in Tulsa, the artist also loves performing acoustic music in intimate listening rooms (he just returned from a week of performing at the Folk Alliance Festival). \u201cGrowing up in the buckle of the Bible belt as a gay man has given me a unique perspective on life, and I think my music can cross genres and speak to people on all walks of life.\u201d\n\n\n\nDirt on Your Hands is released June 2rd, 2017.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9404217.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4375182, 37.7709625], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "Genres: Singer, Songwriter, Americana, Folk, Pop, Blues, Soul, Country, Red Dirt", "OtherInfo": "Blessed to be performing with the fabulous Mary Gauthier and Jaimee Harris for the first time in San Fran!", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "Travis Meadows", "ArtistBio": "An orphan who turned into a preacher\nA preacher who turned into a songwriter\nA songwriter that turned into a drunk\nA drunk that is learning to be a human being\n\nTravis Meadows spent years trying to escape himself. He\u2019s anything but selfish, so he\u2019d find a way to get away\u2013\u2013a bottle, a bag, a sermon\u2013\u2013and he\u2019d share it with everyone. That was then. Now, Meadows isn\u2019t trying to get anybody lost or high. Instead, he\u2019s trying to get every single one of us to settle in deeply to ourselves\u2013\u2013and love what\u2019s there.\n\n\u201cI feel like what I\u2019m doing is giving people permission to be okay with who they are, where they\u2019re at now,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cA lot of us say stuff like, \u2018If I\u2019d been married to this guy or this girl, or if I had enough money, or if I had a better job. If I wasn\u2019t an alcoholic, or if I drank more. If this, if that, then, I think I could be a better person.\u2019\u201d He pauses. \u201cI think the key to life is being okay with who you are.\u201d\n\nMeadows isn\u2019t just waxing poetic about the perks of self-acceptance. The 52-year-old has clawed his way to the peace he\u2019s found, and his willingness to map that journey through his songs has saved more lives than his own. On his anxiously awaited new album First Cigarette, Meadows proves once again that when he sings the truth he\u2019s living, he can set us all free. \u201cI\u2019ve always put secrets in my records, but I had this ring of fire that nobody could get in\u2013\u2013a defense mechanism from my childhood. Nobody gets too close,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this record is a way of me letting people in a little more, inside the ring of fire.\u201d\n\nDisciples have been dancing by Meadows\u2019 fire for years. Eric Church, Dierks Bentley, Jake Owen, Mary Gauthier, Brandy Clark, Blackberry Smoke, Hank Williams, Jr., Wynonna Judd, Randy Houser, and others began writing with, recording, and praising Meadows as soon as they heard his work. Songs such as \u201cRiser,\u201d the title track for Bentley\u2019s 2015 album; Church\u2019s \u201cKnives of New Orleans\u201d and \u201cDark Side\u201d; and Owen\u2019s \u201cWhat We Ain\u2019t Got\u201d are all Meadows-penned chart-climbers.\n\nMuch of the attention began in 2010, when Meadows self-released Killin\u2019 Uncle Buzzy, a raw masterpiece that left listeners stunned. \u201cI was in rehab, and one of my counselors suggested that I keep a journal, so I basically made a record out of that journal,\u201d Meadows says. It became an unlikely phenomenon, handed from friend to friend and artist to artist with whispers of, Listen. It\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ll hear all year. In 2013, Meadows followed Killin\u2019 Uncle Buzzy with the acclaimed Old Ghosts and Unfinished Business. \u201cOn Killin\u2019 Uncle Buzzy, you\u2019re listening to a guy trying to figure out how to get sober,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cThen two years later, I was sober, but I wasn\u2019t that guy anymore. That\u2019s what \u2018Old Ghosts\u2019 was\u2013\u2013me just trying to move forward. I feel like this record is more accessible. People can listen and go, \u2018Well, hell. I\u2019ve done that, too.\u2019\u201d\n\nAn intimate record utilizing just Meadow\u2019s blues-hewn voice and mostly acoustic guitar with pops of electric and other strings, First Cigarette is an intensely relatable meditation on love, acceptance, and redemption\u2013\u2013an artistic and personal triumph, especially for a man whose early life was defined by loss and pain. At the age of two, Meadows watched his baby brother drown. When his parents divorced, he wound up living with his grandparents rather than either of his parents. \u201cMy dad went and got married and had a baby, and they were almost a normal family,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cAnd my mother also went and almost had a normal family, whatever that is.\u201d His thick Mississippi accent makes the \u2018r\u2019 at the end of father and mother soft in his mouth. \u201cI was over there with my grandparents like, \u2018Well what the hell happened to me? Why am I not good enough to be part of that family?\u2019 I carried that resentment for a long time.\u201d\n\nAdversity would remain a constant in Meadows\u2019 youth. At the age of eleven, he began using drugs. At fourteen, he was diagnosed with cancer. He would go on to beat the disease, but not before it cost him his right leg from just below the knee. Meadows picked himself up and began playing drums\u2013\u2013\u201cThey\u2019d sneak me in the back door and I would play for people in bars\u201d\u2013\u2013but tired of lugging all that gear and picked up the harmonica. \u201cI could put all my instruments in a Crown Royal bag, and I would sing and play the blues,\u201d he says. Then, in his 20s, Meadows underwent another conversion: he became a Christian. He preached across the South and in 20-something countries for 17 years. \u201cPreachers fall hard,\u201d he says. \u201cI had some questions I didn\u2019t like the answers to. So I quit and went back to my old friend alcohol.\u201d\n\nFirst Cigarette benefits from all of the battles Meadows has lost and won, including his now seven years\u2013\u2013and counting\u2013\u2013of sobriety. Album opener \u201cSideways\u201d is a gut punch. A blend of confession and advice, the song explores what happens when emotion is stifled. Meadows wrote \u201cSideways\u201d after performing and speaking at an adolescent addiction treatment center. He asked the kids there, all younger than 18, if anyone wanted to share their story. A girl raised her hand, spoke, and broke Meadows\u2019 heart. \u201cShe floored me,\u201d he says. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, I\u2019d want to get high too. How did that make you feel?\u2019 One tear came down her cheek. She rubbed it away and said, \u2018I don\u2019t feel nothin\u2019.\u2019 One of the counselors and I were talking later. If the only tool you have is a hammer, you\u2019re going to treat everything in your life like a nail.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray for Jungleland\u201d channels Bruce Springsteen as it celebrates him, nostalgic for love at eighteen and a world that revolves around Friday night. Written with Drew Kennedy, the song is the first of several on the album that capture youth with misty-eyed levity\u2013\u2013a departure from Uncle Buzzy that Meadows is clearly enjoying. \u201cMcDowell Road\u201d serves as a thematic bookend for \u201cJungleland,\u201d while the slow-building \u201cPontiac\u201d offers anchoring advice and warm memories as hopes for young hearts.\n\nA standout on an album stacked with gems, \u201cFirst Cigarette\u201d features searing vocals that shift back and forth between defiant muscle and naked delicacy. \u201cI am little more content, I am little more content with who I am than who I was,\u201d Meadows sings. \u201cI have learned to love the comfort when it comes, like the first cigarette the morning buzz.\u201d Written with Connie Harrington, \u201cHungry\u201d showcases Meadows\u2019 unique ability to haunt and soothe at the same time. \u201cHunger is the thing that motivates us to get up and try again,\u201d he says. \u201cI pray that I never lose that hunger.\u201d The gorgeous \u201cBetter Boat\u201d takes another moving look at Meadows\u2019 hard-won contentment.\n\n\u201cLife can be a little challenging for all of us. It\u2019s beautiful and it\u2019s tragic, it\u2019s awesome and it hurts,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cI hope people sense that through this record and want to come to a show, which is a lot of storytelling, a lot of tears, a lot of laughter.

He\u2019s anything but selfish, so he\u2019d find a way to get away\u2013\u2013a bottle, a bag, a sermon\u2013\u2013and he\u2019d share it with everyone. That was then. Now, Meadows isn\u2019t trying to get anybody lost or high. Instead, he\u2019s trying to get every single one of us to settle in deeply to ourselves\u2013\u2013and love what\u2019s there.\n\n\u201cI feel like what I\u2019m doing is giving people permission to be okay with who they are, where they\u2019re at now,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cA lot of us say stuff like, \u2018If I\u2019d been married to this guy or this girl, or if I had enough money, or if I had a better job. If I wasn\u2019t an alcoholic, or if I drank more. If this, if that, then, I think I could be a better person.\u2019\u201d He pauses. \u201cI think the key to life is being okay with who you are.\u201d\n\nMeadows isn\u2019t just waxing poetic about the perks of self-acceptance. The 52-year-old has clawed his way to the peace he\u2019s found, and his willingness to map that journey through his songs has saved more lives than his own. On his anxiously awaited new album First Cigarette, Meadows proves once again that when he sings the truth he\u2019s living, he can set us all free. \u201cI\u2019ve always put secrets in my records, but I had this ring of fire that nobody could get in\u2013\u2013a defense mechanism from my childhood. Nobody gets too close,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this record is a way of me letting people in a little more, inside the ring of fire.\u201d\n\nDisciples have been dancing by Meadows\u2019 fire for years. Eric Church, Dierks Bentley, Jake Owen, Mary Gauthier, Brandy Clark, Blackberry Smoke, Hank Williams, Jr., Wynonna Judd, Randy Houser, and others began writing with, recording, and praising Meadows as soon as they heard his work. Songs such as \u201cRiser,\u201d the title track for Bentley\u2019s 2015 album; Church\u2019s \u201cKnives of New Orleans\u201d and \u201cDark Side\u201d; and Owen\u2019s \u201cWhat We Ain\u2019t Got\u201d are all Meadows-penned chart-climbers.\n\nMuch of the attention began in 2010, when Meadows self-released Killin\u2019 Uncle Buzzy, a raw masterpiece that left listeners stunned. \u201cI was in rehab, and one of my counselors suggested that I keep a journal, so I basically made a record out of that journal,\u201d Meadows says. It became an unlikely phenomenon, handed from friend to friend and artist to artist with whispers of, Listen. It\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ll hear all year. In 2013, Meadows followed Killin\u2019 Uncle Buzzy with the acclaimed Old Ghosts and Unfinished Business. \u201cOn Killin\u2019 Uncle Buzzy, you\u2019re listening to a guy trying to figure out how to get sober,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cThen two years later, I was sober, but I wasn\u2019t that guy anymore. That\u2019s what \u2018Old Ghosts\u2019 was\u2013\u2013me just trying to move forward. I feel like this record is more accessible. People can listen and go, \u2018Well, hell. I\u2019ve done that, too.\u2019\u201d\n\nAn intimate record utilizing just Meadow\u2019s blues-hewn voice and mostly acoustic guitar with pops of electric and other strings, First Cigarette is an intensely relatable meditation on love, acceptance, and redemption\u2013\u2013an artistic and personal triumph, especially for a man whose early life was defined by loss and pain. At the age of two, Meadows watched his baby brother drown. When his parents divorced, he wound up living with his grandparents rather than either of his parents. \u201cMy dad went and got married and had a baby, and they were almost a normal family,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cAnd my mother also went and almost had a normal family, whatever that is.\u201d His thick Mississippi accent makes the \u2018r\u2019 at the end of father and mother soft in his mouth. \u201cI was over there with my grandparents like, \u2018Well what the hell happened to me? Why am I not good enough to be part of that family?\u2019 I carried that resentment for a long time.\u201d\n\nAdversity would remain a constant in Meadows\u2019 youth. At the age of eleven, he began using drugs. At fourteen, he was diagnosed with cancer. He would go on to beat the disease, but not before it cost him his right leg from just below the knee. Meadows picked himself up and began playing drums\u2013\u2013\u201cThey\u2019d sneak me in the back door and I would play for people in bars\u201d\u2013\u2013but tired of lugging all that gear and picked up the harmonica. \u201cI could put all my instruments in a Crown Royal bag, and I would sing and play the blues,\u201d he says. Then, in his 20s, Meadows underwent another conversion: he became a Christian. He preached across the South and in 20-something countries for 17 years. \u201cPreachers fall hard,\u201d he says. \u201cI had some questions I didn\u2019t like the answers to. So I quit and went back to my old friend alcohol.\u201d\n\nFirst Cigarette benefits from all of the battles Meadows has lost and won, including his now seven years\u2013\u2013and counting\u2013\u2013of sobriety. Album opener \u201cSideways\u201d is a gut punch. A blend of confession and advice, the song explores what happens when emotion is stifled. Meadows wrote \u201cSideways\u201d after performing and speaking at an adolescent addiction treatment center. He asked the kids there, all younger than 18, if anyone wanted to share their story. A girl raised her hand, spoke, and broke Meadows\u2019 heart. \u201cShe floored me,\u201d he says. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, I\u2019d want to get high too. How did that make you feel?\u2019 One tear came down her cheek. She rubbed it away and said, \u2018I don\u2019t feel nothin\u2019.\u2019 One of the counselors and I were talking later. If the only tool you have is a hammer, you\u2019re going to treat everything in your life like a nail.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray for Jungleland\u201d channels Bruce Springsteen as it celebrates him, nostalgic for love at eighteen and a world that revolves around Friday night. Written with Drew Kennedy, the song is the first of several on the album that capture youth with misty-eyed levity\u2013\u2013a departure from Uncle Buzzy that Meadows is clearly enjoying. \u201cMcDowell Road\u201d serves as a thematic bookend for \u201cJungleland,\u201d while the slow-building \u201cPontiac\u201d offers anchoring advice and warm memories as hopes for young hearts.\n\nA standout on an album stacked with gems, \u201cFirst Cigarette\u201d features searing vocals that shift back and forth between defiant muscle and naked delicacy. \u201cI am little more content, I am little more content with who I am than who I was,\u201d Meadows sings. \u201cI have learned to love the comfort when it comes, like the first cigarette the morning buzz.\u201d Written with Connie Harrington, \u201cHungry\u201d showcases Meadows\u2019 unique ability to haunt and soothe at the same time. \u201cHunger is the thing that motivates us to get up and try again,\u201d he says. \u201cI pray that I never lose that hunger.\u201d The gorgeous \u201cBetter Boat\u201d takes another moving look at Meadows\u2019 hard-won contentment.\n\n\u201cLife can be a little challenging for all of us. It\u2019s beautiful and it\u2019s tragic, it\u2019s awesome and it hurts,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cI hope people sense that through this record and want to come to a show, which is a lot of storytelling, a lot of tears, a lot of laughter. They\u2019ll come face to face with a damn lot of humanity.

Most recently, the album was nominated for a GRAMMY in the Best Folk Album category for 2017.\n\n\n\nOn September 29th, she became the first woman to earn the International Bluegrass Music Association's Mandolin Player of the Year award. In addition, Weighted Mind was nominated for Album of the Year and Sierra's self penned 'Black River' was nominated for Song of the Year. Sierra also co-hosted the awards show with Dan Tyminski.\n\n\n\nIn May, Sierra was honored with an exhibit at the world famous Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, TN. The exhibit features her childhood mandolin along with other personal items from both past and present.\n\n\n\nWith support from Ethan Jodziewicz & Justin Moses in 2016, Sierra has toured extensively in support of Weighted Mind with stops at some of the most revered venues and music festivals in the country such as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival and the Grand Ole Opry.\n\n\n\nIt's safe to say she is moving into 2017 full steam ahead.\n\n\n\nHer friend and hero, Alison Krauss, who has won more Grammy awards than any female artist in history, says of Hull, \u201cI think she\u2019s endless. I don\u2019t see any boundaries. Talent like hers is so rare, and I don\u2019t think it stops. It\u2019s round.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n| ABOUT SIERRA |\n\nHull first joined Alison Krauss on stage at the Grand Ole Opry when she was just 11 years old, and she has been astonishing audiences and fellow musicians alike ever since. She was the first bluegrass musician to receive a Presidential Scholarship at the Berklee College of Music. Now a seasoned touring musician nearing her mid-20s, Hull speaks eloquently in her challenging and sensitive original songs, and she continues to break new ground on the mandolin. The Chicago Tribune praised her \u201ccrystalline voice;\u201d Rolling Stone listed her performance as one of the 8 best things they saw at DelFest.\n\n\n\n| ABOUT THE ALBUM WEIGHTED MIND |\n\n\n\nThis is the Turning Point.\n\nThis is where a preternatural talent becomes a natural woman.\n\n\n\nThis is Sierra Hull\u2019s Weighted Mind. It is nothing like what we thought it would be. It is nothing like what we\u2019ve heard before, from anyone. It is singular and emphatic, harmonious and dissonant. It is the realization of promise, and the affirmation of individuality. It is born of difficulty and indecision, yet it rings with ease, decisiveness, and beauty.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe plays the mandolin with a degree of refined elegance and freedom that few have achieved,\u201d says Bela Fleck, the genre-leaping banjo master who produced Weighted Mind. \u201cAnd now her vocals and songwriting have matured to the level of her virtuosity.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlison Krauss, who has won more Grammy awards than any female artist in history, says of Hull, \u201cI think she\u2019s endless. I don\u2019t see any boundaries. Talent like hers is so rare, and I don\u2019t think it stops. It\u2019s round.\u201d\n\n\n\nHull came to us as a bluegrass thrush, a teen prodigy. Krauss called her to the Grand Ole Opry stage when Hull was 11-years-old. Two years later, she signed with Rounder Records, and soon became known as a remarkable mandolin player, a tone-true vocalist, and a recording artist of high order. She made two acclaimed albums. She played the White House, and Carnegie Hall, and the Kennedy Center, and she became the first bluegrass musician to receive a Presidential Scholarship at the Berklee College of Music.\n\n\n\nShe was celebrated, yet adrift. Stranded, even.\n\n\n\nWhat she felt at 22 was not what she felt at 12, and the music Sierra Hull was writing and playing at home was different from the music she was making on stages.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn some way, I was needing to run from the thing that everybody thought I was being,\u201d she says now, at 24.\n\n\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t running so much as plodding.\n\n\n\nShe fielded myriad opinions about hypothetical courses. She grew vulnerable, and weighted, and she wrote songs about all of that. She found solace in an antique Brenda Ueland book that advised, \u201cEverybody is original, if he tells the truth, if he speaks from himself.\u201d\n\nsierra hull weighted mind bio\n\nAnd she talked with Krauss, the childhood hero who had become an adult confidante.\n\n\n\n\u201cSierra did well in music very fast and very young,\u201d says Krauss. \u201cSometimes when that happens, people don\u2019t want you to change. It\u2019s, \u2018We know you as this, and now you\u2019re scaring us.\u2019 But there wasn\u2019t a question about what she wanted. She just needed somebody to listen to her and say, \u2018What you have to say is valuable. If this is what you feel and what you want to say, you wait until you get to say it.\u2019\u201d Krauss also suggested she talk with Fleck.\n\nSierra Hull weighted mind album bio\n\n\u201cSierra lives in the border area where new ideas mix to create hybrids, and sometimes brand new directions,\u201d he says. \u201cHer own voice was quietly telling her something that was hard to hear over all the advice she was getting.\u201d Fleck asked her to play him her new songs, without accompaniment: Just voice and mandolin.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven when I was fronting a band, I\u2019d always been an ensemble player,\u201d Hull says. \u201cTo do something by myself made me rethink everything.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd so she rethought, and she found new ways to play the new songs she\u2019d written. In short time, what had been arduous now seemed genuine and innate. C.S. Lewis\u2019 quote about how \u201cthe longest way round is the shortest way home\u201d made sense. And a dazzling and atypical album was made possible.\n\n\n\nHull\u2019s songs did not remain bare of all but mandolin and voice, though those are the essential elements here.

In the best of all possible worlds, it would be heard in an acoustically perfect concert hall by an audiencethat sits undistracted in the dark listening intently to itsexquisitely sculpted lyrics, transcendent melodies and intricately woven instrumentation. But it\u2019ll work just fine in your car stereo, too.\n\nLowrey is a former member of and opening act for the Zac Brown Band and co-writer of the ZBB hits, \u201cColder Weather\u201d and \u201cThe Wind.\u201d\n\nThe Roots of the album\u2019s title refers to 11 songs made famous in the late 1920s and early \u201830s by Lowrey\u2019s great-great grandfather, fiddler Gid Tanner and members his celebrated band, the Skillet Lickers. During that era, Tanner eclipsed or stood shoulder-to-shoulder in popularity with the now legendary Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers. In reviving these classics, Lowrey\u2014a commanding fiddler and guitarist in his own right\u2014is backed by the current edition of the Skillet Lickers, a self-regenerating assemblage of virtuosi that includes Phil Tanner, Russ Tanner, Fleet Stanley, Larry Nash and Joel Aderhold.\n\nThe Branches disc spotlights Lowrey\u2019s astounding skillsas a singer, songwriter, instrumentalist, bandleader and producer. Of the 10 songs here, the Dacula, Georgia nativewrote or co-wrote eight, each a cinematically luminous glimpse of adult life. \u201cI try to make my lyrics as relatable as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m one man going through my own set of failures and successes, my own story. But the core of these emotions are experienced by everyone. I\u2019m not afraid of being human.\u201d\n\nThat humanity is forged and tempered in what one song calls \u201cthe side effects of living.\u201d And, thus, we hear in Lowrey\u2019s lyrics meditations on fate, regrets, guilt (both personal and cosmic), self-effacement, world-weariness, immortality, restlessness and the magnetic lure of home. If that sounds like too heavy an agenda for mere music, fear not\u2014Lowrey leads us through these emotional rough spots with a savior\u2019s touch.\n\nIn Lowrey\u2019s universe, music and a sense of community are inseparable. He recalls his grandparents taking him to jam sessions every Friday night at the \u201cChicken House\u201d on GidTanner\u2019s farm. It was just that\u2014a converted chicken house\u2014in which local musicians gathered for joy, relief and companionship.\n\n\u201cThat was the beginning of music,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore you had records being sold and the commercialization of music, it was primarily a get-together. That was the reason for it. It always belonged in a community. I feel we\u2019ve lost sight of that. Now it\u2019s about record sales and touring and concerts and things of that nature. I don\u2019t get quite as much fulfillment from that as I do sitting around on the front porch playing with a bunch of guys.\u201d\n\nIn the sixth grade, Lowrey began taking classical violin lessons and soon moved on to playing fiddle music, taking in and assimilating all the instrumental techniques and flourishes he saw on display at the Chicken House. Even so, he stayed in the school orchestra throughout high school. In his sophomore year, he joined a rock band, playing lead guitar, and performing at fairs and clubs in Atlanta, Athens and the surrounding areas.\n\n\u201cWe never really did anything big, never really got anywhere with it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just enjoyed it. It was some of the best times I ever had playing music.\u201d\n\nHis next move was to join Sonia Leigh\u2019s band as a fiddler. \u201cAll the while I was writing my own stuff,\u201d he recalls, \u201ccoming up with my own voice and kind of figuring out what I had to say. About two years after I went withSonia, I started playing out on my own and doing my own thing a lot more. I eventually decided to make music my full time profession. I was working construction at the time as a framer. So I quit my job and played just as much as I possibly could. I think one year\u2014between my gigs and hers\u2014we did over 285 shows. It was the only way we could make any money. You just kind of went up there and busted your ass, maybe for $25 bucks, especially in Athens. In some joints you got paid your bar tab.\u201d\n\nAfter touring with Leigh for years, Lowrey found himself playing on the same bill with Zac Brown at the Dixie Tavern in Marietta, Georgia. \u201cZac\u2019s star was rising and he ended up forming a record label,\u201d Lowrey says. \u201cSonia and I both signed to it on the same day. About then, Sonia and I went our separate ways. With my obligations as a recording artist, I couldn\u2019t play with her fulltime. I hit the road with Zac and toured with him for several years. And I wrote a bunch of good songs with him. When the label folded, I went completely independent and put out My Crazy Head in 2015. Roots and Branches is my second independent release.\u201d\n\nIt was while touring with Brown that Lowrey realized it was time to choose what he wanted to achieve with his music. He and Brown were sitting on the bus before a show \u201ceither in Greenville, South Carolina or Greensboro, North Carolina\u201d when Brown asked the crucial question. \u201cZac said, \u2018Do you want to be me\u2014to follow this path that I\u2019m on [to stardom]\u2014or do you want to be Darrell Scott?\u2019 Darrell Scott\u2019s my heroin that he found something to say and a voice to say it with and the determination to control what he will and won\u2019t do. And I chose then and still choose to this day \u2018to be\u2019 Darrell Scott.\u201d\n\nBut he loved the songwriting that came from his time with Brown. \u201cWe were writing all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cZac used to write almost every night. Everybody who was on that tour wrote a bunch of songs. We had a joke that the ones who could stay up the longest were the ones who got the songwriting credit. We all contributed so much.\u201d\n\nBeing the heir to a distinguished musical dynasty hasn\u2019t been all that intimidating, Lowrey says. \u201cFirst of all, the family is not as well known as you\u2019d think it is or it should be. The only time I feel pressure is when I get around people who know more about Gid Tanner than I do.\u201d That happened earlier this year when Lowrey was invited to perform at the International Country Music Conference in Nashville. Made up of scholars and country music enthusiasts to whom the name \u201cGid Tanner\u201d is magical, the conference welcomed Lowrey like a celebrity, rushing out afterward to buy his albums and ask for autographs and pictures. It was a display of affection and respect Darrell Scott might have envied.\n\nAs it turns out, Lowrey\u2019s musical role model isn\u2019t GidTanner, but rather his son, Gordon. \u201cHe passed away before I was born,\u201d Lowrey says, \u201cbut I used to sit down and listen to old tapes of him playing fiddle for hours on end and try to copy everything he did. So the way I play \u2018Down Yonder\u2019 or \u2018Listen To The Mocking Bird\u2019 or \u2018The Old Spinning Wheel\u2019 or \u2018Out Of My Bandage\u2019\u2014that\u2019s all from Gordon. For my two cents, there was no better fiddle player in that family.\u201d\n\nThese days, Lowrey plays a lot of listening rooms and house concerts, venues where he can get to know his audiences by face and name and be invited back. \u201cI\u2019m never tried to be any kind of superstar who disappears right before or right after the show. I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s going to hang out with you all night long.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8379591.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-79.6665, 43.4474], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Songwriter, Singer", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Oakville, CA"}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "Andy Alemany", "ArtistBio": "In the musical universe, there are talented and singular voices, but there are others that have unique qualities, even when they're not in the forefront. That's the voice of Latin Grammy Award Nominee Andy Alemany.\n\nA native of Buffalo, NY and with well-established latin roots, his life was always tied to ministry. During his adolescence his parents were youth pastors and little by little he became involved in music and within his church. He was later given the opportunity to join SOG (Sounds of Glory), his first true band experience, which paved the way to becoming one of the most sought out background vocalist for different musical genre\u2019s and ministries.\n\nFor more than a decade he was part of Ricardo S\u00e1nchez's vocal team. A season where he grew as a worship leader and where he had the opportunity to share the stage and sing background vocals not only with Ricardo but with artists such as Israel Houghton, Kim Walker, Danny Gookey, Montell Jordan, Danilo Montero and Lucia Parker, among others.\n\nBy 2016, after months of strategic planning and working on his musical production, since going by the way of worship would have been the easiest, he decided to take his style to another level. A level where his songs could be accessible to all and empathically focus on his contemporary pop message of worship, something that goes beyond music. From His experiences is where his first single \u201cEres,\u201d was born. It was received with much enthusiasm in the Latin market.

Celebrated as San Francisco\u2019s ambassadors of Gypsy Rock, these world-renowned entertainers have created an irresistible m\u00e9lange that is entirely their own. A Diego\u2019s Umbrella show is a singular, ecstatic experience. One concert is all it takes to becoming a believer. Night after night they effortlessly blend eastern European sounds, marching drums, beautiful harmonies and catchy hooks with a showmanship that has all the fire and unpredictability of youth, marked by a chiseled refinement of years of experience on the road. The group\u2019s uncanny gift for pleasing crowds, from standard clubs to huge festivals such as High Sierra and Outside Lands, has earned them a zealous and ever-expanding following across the United States and Europe. Continuously touring abroad has always fed their aesthetic, and has resulted in incorporating the scales of klezmer, the strings of flamenco, and the energy of punk rock. Their new material is some of the most exciting to date, tipping a hat to the raucous Croatian dance parties the band played in their early days.

They debuted as Complicated Animals in 2015, with the release of their 6-song EP \u201cIn This Game\u201d. Written and recorded in a cabin in the woods in Michigan, \u201cIn This Game\u201d received rave reviews from blogs and journalists, and was called the \u201cbeginning of a new sound\u201d by PopMatters.\n\nComplicated Animals released their brand new single Show Me on 1/19/18. While creating their new track, Monica da Silva and Chad Alger were greatly inspired by their recent move to Los Angeles, the music of the 80s, a love for lush, dreamy pop songs, and all things David Lynch. The Brazilian American duo say that although their new track encompasses more of an electronic, synth-based feel, the lyrical subject matter was based on organic, human emotion.\n\n\u201cShow Me (that you want me) really struck me as an intense idea for a song,\u201d says vocalist da Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s scary how detached we humans have become. Technology is great, but we\u2019ve got to remember how important human interaction is, and not just go through the motions like zombies. For this song, Chad dug an old synthesizer we had out of the closet. We started stacking sounds and layering vocals. The production came together quickly, and virtually all of the sounds in the track were created using the same synth.\u201d\n\nMonica da Silva's song Back To His Girl is now featured in the movie Lady Bird. Complicated Animals\u2019 music has also been featured in The World Cup, on international compilations such as Putumayo World Music\u2019s Brazilian Beat, and Ibiza Beats, in the BBC One drama The Replacement, and is slated to appear in the upcoming Paramount Network series American Woman.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8537608.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.280258, 38.302862], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "Genres: Indie, Indie Pop, Brazilian Music, Bossa Nova, Electronic, Dream Pop, Alternative, Acoustic, Singer, Songwriter", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "The CIA at Copia (The Culinary Institute of America)"}, {"Address": "330 Virginia Street, Vallejo, CA 94590", "Artist": "Tessie", "ArtistBio": "Hailing from Vallejo, California you can often hear the bay area influenced bounce and lingo combined with sultry acoustic guitars and island riddims in Tessie\u2019s music. Tessie has been exposed to music her entire life. Covering hit songs by the beatles and more with her father at just the tender age of 2, Tessie was destined to sing. With a musician and instrumentalist as a father, Tessie began to dabble with instruments herself. She began covering some of her favorite songs on YouTube while playing the ukelele. Despite her heavy exposure to rock from her father and kuya (older brother) she eventually gravitated towards artist like JoJo, Alicia Keys and Jazmine Sullivan to name a few.\nTessie\u2019s music could be best described as a soundtrack to the life of the everyday girl stuck in her 20 somethings. Offering the nostalgic vibes of early 2000\u2019s R&B, she also has a very modern, melodic, and fun way of delivering her feelings. She could get quite eventful with the cadences and flows she opts to use in some of her tracks. Tessie\u2019s music possesses a very intimate and vulnerable feel. She has a way of placing you right in her sandals for the duration of the song. It\u2019s almost as if she uses songwriting as a method of taking accountability and healing her wounds. She does extremely well at turning her insecurities into art and putting them on display for the listener.\nTessie has been working the past few years at finding herself and along with that came a sound and style solely of her own. In 2017 she began releasing music as part of a duo with rapper / best friend Tota under the name WeAreYou. Garnering mild success following a few releases such as their single Shhhlide which currently sits at over half a million streams on Spotify, Tessie began to create more and set out to establish a lane as a solo artist as well.\nTessie just recently released her debut single titled, \u201cRude Boy\u201d on January 28th following a headlining show in the Bay Area which she calls home. On the surface Rude Boy is a fun melodic record with commercial appeal but when you dive past the soothing vocals and airy guitars into the lyrics it\u2019s a perfect example of Tessie\u2019s ability to make something as serious and vulnerable as her relationship woes and struggles with self-love into a fun enjoyable experience for the listener. Opening the track with the line, \u201cI thought I was done messing with you, but you found your way back up in my room\u201d Tessie immediately sets the scene and tone of the track where she talks about her struggles dealing with a toxic lover.\nTessie is positioning herself to have an eventful year! With the help of her team and family Tessie is building a solid foundation for herself already accumulating a fan base at home in. Tessie lives by her favorite quote, \u201cAlways believe that something wonderful is about to happen\u201d by Dr. Sukhraj Dhillon. Something wonderful definitely happens when you listen to Tessie\u2019s music.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9259066.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.257147, 38.102407], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "Genres: R&B, soul, Pop", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Empress Theatre"}, {"Address": "924 Gilman St, Berkeley, CA 94706", "Artist": "Elder Brother", "ArtistBio": "\"Heavy Head\" out March 11 2014.

This led to him not noticing the prominent presence of racial inequality until becoming of age and actually learning about and experiencing systemic oppression first hand. Finding out later in life that his grandfather was a member of the original Black Panther party, he kicked his studies into overdrive and really found himself. He began to dedicate much of his music to shed light on the war against his people and how oppression has affected urban cities in America. Though not possessing a traditional Bay Area sound, he does not shy away from letting people know where he\u2019s from as he did in his drake inspired track \u201c6PM In Vallejo\u201d where he displays his talents delivering bar after bar for an entire 3 minutes.\nTota possesses a storytelling capability comparable to a Nas or J. Cole. He often supplements this storytelling ability with witty, sometimes comedic punchlines. Though not having the most prominent voice he does have a way of making his presence felt through his use of tonality, flow, and cadence. Every track encompasses a different feeling and energy often driven by content filled, sociopolitical messages. The passion and emotion he provides in tracks often leaves the listener with the perception that the track was felt more so than heard.\nTota often uses his upbringing and life experiences to take you on a journey into his world. He has a knack for making his experiences feel extremely relative to the listener even if they\u2019ve never had such experience themselves. He tends to be extremely open and forward about his life which often connects and resonates with the listener on a personal level.\nThough his sound is immensely different than those who he deems as influences, you can still hear the attack of a Kendrick Lamar, the realism of a J. Cole and the comedic wit of a Kanye West whom he gives huge attribution to for molding his sound.\nIn January Tota released his debut project \u201cThe Field Effect\u201d which is a politically driven ode about the mentality oppression and racism has created within the black community. It is an open discussion shedding light on the ugly truths of how systemic racism from slavery days, subsequently affects black people now. Tota uses this project to narrate the experiences and trials he and many other inner-city youths have and still face till this day.\nFollowing a headlining show in his hometown, July 28th Tota released his second project titled, \u201cNever Forget Who You Are\u201d. Tota follows his strong conscious debut \u201cThe Field Effect\u201d with an even stronger message. In this album he touches on depression, oppression, conditioning, happiness, pain and every other emotion you can feel. The delivery is much tighter, and the songs are filled with melodic aggression and soul. Tota really opens up on this album about personal issues in his own life rather than just speaking on social issues like he did in the \u201cField Effect\u201d. Once again Tota delivers with witty bars and insane delivery. The cover is a picture of him and his grandmother in which he uses as a reminder of where he comes from and who he truly is. \u201cNever Forget Who You Are\u201d is a note to self that no matter how abundant this life becomes, you cannot lose yourself within it.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9259072.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.257147, 38.102407], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Empress Theatre"}, {"Address": "850 Tamarack Ave, San Carlos, CA 94070", "Artist": "Explorer", "ArtistBio": "It started as kids in their garages, playing the local scene back in the day, circa 1981.

Kurt was born in 1980, one of ten children, and raised in the city of brotherly love, Philadelphia. As a teenager, his bluegrass-loving father gifted him with a banjo, when what Kurt craved was a guitar \u2013 so he played it as if it were.\n\n\n\nBewitched by lo-fi figureheads like Beck, Pavement, and Smog, along with a love for classics like Petty, Creedence, and Neil Young, he recorded his first songs and self-distributed them on CD-R between 2003 and 2007. These were compiled on 2008\u2019s Constant Hitmaker and the 2009 mini-album God Is Saying This To You... The dreamy and psychedelic tangles of damaged but still-lyrical songcraft announced a major new artist wandering in from the hinterlands.\n\n\n\nThe Violators (then featuring Adam Granduciel, with whom Vile had co-founded The War On Drugs) debuted on the 2009 EP The Hunchback, coming into their own on Childish Prodigy, Vile\u2019s third album and his first for Matador. More violent, more vivid, more ecstatically \u2018rock\u2019 than anything in Vile\u2019s catalogue, the album was a righteous leap forward. The album that followed, the breakthrough Smoke Ring For My Halo, was more reflective, something sun-dappled and sexy in softly strung-out strums like \u201cPeeping Tomboy,\u201d the kindred flipside to barnstormers like \u201cFreak Train\u201d off the previous record.\n\n\n\nHis fifth album, Wakin On A Pretty Daze, is a 69-minute double LP and Kurt\u2019s defining statement to date. Where previous albums alternated between gorgeous fingerpicking and heavy guitar workouts, this album blends the two in dreamy, expansive songs that gradually unfurl like a massive flag. It is a record that would have sounded great 30 years ago, sounds great today, and will still sound great 30 years from now.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8813691.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43312, 37.783918], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Folk, Indie Rock, Indie, Alternative", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Fillmore"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Obituary", "ArtistBio": "This is the \"Official\" Facebook Of Obituary. Upon switching their name from Xecutioner to Obituary, the career of one of the most successful and influential Death Metal bands began. Hailing from Florida and featuring John Tardy (vocals), brother Donald Tardy (drums), Trevor Peres (guitar), Allen West (guitar), and Daniel Tucker (bass), the band signed to Roadracer Records, a now defunct division of Roadrunner, for the recording of their debut album\u2014the immense and immeasurably heavy \u201cSlowly We Rot\u201d (1989). The album was engineered by the legendary Scott Burns at Morrisound Studio, which would come to be the most sought after facility for production of albums during 1990\u2019s rise of the Death Metal genre. Unlike much death metal preceding it, the album had a sludgy feel and integrated devastatingly slow passages along with obliterating overtures that reached far beyond any point of mayhem that metal had yet to reach; the result was a carnal pleasure for doom, death and thrash fans alike coupling the adrenaline of a speedball with the slow, degrading measures of a sewer at dusk. Like them or not, Obituary was unlike anything anyone had heard before. \u201cSlowly We Rot\u201d was chaotic, bass heavy mix of manic guitar solos and crashing drums, but it was undeniably characterized by vocalist John Tardy\u2019s disarmingly horrific, gargling style, that created guttural chasms of dread which though often strived for, to date have been paralleled by none. The ability to augment tempo so drastically became the band\u2019s trademark along with Tardy\u2019s unique vocal style, which distinguished them clearly from the rest of the emerging Florida Death Metal bands; nowhere is this more apparent than on the prophetic title track of their debut. The fact that Obituary refrained from printing lyric sheets with their albums led people to believe that they didn't actually write any lyrics. Some may question the verbosity or absence of documented lyrics, however, any true fan has each grunt, growl and howling grimace committed to memory like an utterance from God in painstaking form\u2014what does not exist can not be remembered, and an Obituary show is testimony to the re-creation of what your ears couldn't believe in the first place. Once again bringing augmentation to irony, Live and Dead worked quite well for the quintet, dividing your conscience yet leaving much to the imagination; not since birth have your senses been so graphically assaulted yet pleased at the same time. While such differing sensations once seemed incongruous, Obituary have proven the ability to merge unlikely dichotomies, from their slow-as-hell-yet-fast-as-fuck style to the non-evil, homegrown approach to what would largely become the satanized, bastardized, make-up wearing movement known as Death Metal. The maturation of the musicians into songwriters taking more visionary and complex forms would soon be heard world wide as Obituary took metal by storm in 1990. Despite their youth upon release of their sophomore offering, \u201cCause of Death\u201d embodied the confident swagger of the most fearsome pack-leading hound. From the insidious growls of John\u2019s vocals to the barrage of Donald Tardy\u2019s thunderously-metered explosions of double bass, \u201cCause of Death\u201d was the intention and method as promised by the early threat of \u201cSlowly We Rot\u201d; for Obituary, Death was just the beginning. Accordingly, the title track alone (\u201cCause of Death\u201d) would be heard, regurgitated, manipulated, complimented and collapsed\u2014but never duplicated\u2014on third and forth generation death metal albums for years to come. Lovecraftian imagery and aural morbidity aside, even a deaf man found fear when confronted by the formidable visage of guitarist Peres; entering Frank Watkins, the hulking henchman of a bassist from South Florida, finally provided long-needed and powerful rhythm stability to the line up. However, the grinding of the axes would not be complete until the return of Xecutioner veteran Allen West, who, along with Peres and Tardy, crafted the foundation for most of Obituary\u2019s most primordial and historic moments. Attack now whole, Obituary had given birth\u2014sight, sound and feel\u2014to a true horror greater than metal had ever known. The paradox herein lies that Obituary was anything but a summation to and end, but more an exploratory journey into the infinite dehumanization of all that is known, as confronted brazenly by their best selling release yet, \u201cThe End Complete\u201d and later followed by the cynical and dark expedition of \u201cWorld Demise\u201d. Reunited with songwriter West, the band was conjoined like quintuplets sharing life and a name. Though finality was possibly inferred by these titles, Obituary was anything but finished. Ironically, the images conjured by songs such as \u201cDon\u2019t Care\u201d, \u201cPlatonic Disease\u201d and \u201cWorld Demise\u201d seemingly foretold of the millennium as can now be seen daily, displayed plainly across the screens of CNN and reality TV programs world wide; not bad for a bunch of rednecks from Florida with Budweiser dreams and bongwater nightmares. 2004 brings reason for Obituary fans to rejoice, the sunken eyes and heaving cries have all but abated. Obituary has only aspired to live up to the standard they have set for themselves, one that numerous bands have strived to duplicate, but never attained, falling short both creatively and in lack of the unique talent that each member contributes to the near indescribable Obituary sound. Like a forgotten corpse in the basement, Obituary are back to haunt, taunt and fully pollute your senses. Fermenting like waste in the hot Florida sun, Obituary return from hiatus with the voracity of a starven wretch. The forfeiture of time brings blessings of brutality, and assurance that the Dead shall indeed rise again. Such aural abrasion can only be heard on an Obituary album or the live circumcision of a thirty-year-old man, the choice is yours...

Preorder at the links below. CD/Digital: https://ub40.lnk.to/ARLOLFT LP: https://ub40.lnk.to/ARLOL_LPFT \u2018A Real Labour Of Love\u2019 is the new album from UB40 Featuring Ali, Astro & Mickey, to be released March 2nd on UMC. Lead single \u2018She Loves Me Now\u2019 received its exclusive first play today on BBC Radio 2, and will be available tomorrow to stream and download as an instant grat with album pre-orders. As founding members of Britain\u2019s biggest reggae band UB40, singer Ali Campbell, second vocalist Astro and keyboardist Mickey Virtue topped the UK singles chart on three occasions and sold 70 million records as they took their smooth yet rootsy musical blend to all corners of the globe. Now with \u2018A Real Labour Of Love\u2019 the trio give us a fresh take on the legendary series of albums, putting the focus primarily on reggae tracks from the 1980s. \u201cThe first three albums featured the songs we grew up listening to,\u201d says Ali. \u201cThis one is built around the records we were listening to once UB40 were on the road.\u201d Between 1983 and 1998 UB40 produced three \u2018Labour Of Love\u2019 albums, bringing hits such as Eric Donaldson\u2019s \u2018Cherry Oh Baby\u2019, Lord Creator\u2019s \u2018Kingston Town\u2019 and Johnny Osbourne\u2019s \u2018Come Back Darling\u2019 to a new, global audience. They also topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with their reggae cover of Neil Diamond\u2019s \u2018Red Red Wine\u2019. And now 20 years later Ali, Astro and Mickey are revitalising the concept by exploring the tunes of a later golden age, \u2018A Real Labour Of Love\u2019 sees the group explore the songs that defined reggae in the Eighties. The concept isn\u2019t a rigid one: Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u2018A Place In The Sun\u2019 is a Motown classic from 1966, and there are numbers from the late Seventies in Dennis Brown\u2019s sublime \u2018How Could I Leave\u2019 and Culture\u2019s \u2018International Herb\u2019. But most of the tracks on \u2018A Real Labour Of Love\u2019 are from the Eighties, a decade that saw dancehall reggae enter the mainstream.

He began playing trumpet around age 11 after hearing Cheatham play in New York City, and by his teens was studying music at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in Jacksonville, Florida. From 2003 to 2007, Croker attended the music conservatory at Oberlin College. While at Oberlin, he was mentored by legendary trumpeter and educator Donald Byrd. Also during this time, he earned the Presser Music Foundation Award, which funded his debut album, 2006's Fundamentals. After graduating Oberlin, Croker relocated to China, where he took up residency at Shanghai's House of Blues. His 2009 album, In the Tradition, paid tribute to Cheatham.\n\nIn 2013, Croker returned to the States and began work on his third solo album, the Dee Dee Bridgewater-produced Afro Physicist. Released in 2014 on OKeh/Sony Masterworks Records, the Echo Award nominated album found him branching out stylistically, weaving elements of funk, Latin jazz, and hip-hop into his sound. In 2016, he delivered Escape Velocity, which found him delving deeper into a genre-bending, spiritually enlightened, funk-influenced jazz sound.\n\nUpon the album\u2019s release, The Wall Street Journal heralded the album as \u201c timeless and of-the-moment\u201d.

On this recording, Valdes is again featured with his Afro-Cuban Messengers, and the compositions include nods to flamenco, the Gnawa music of Morocco and the ritual rhythms of the Orishas, the deities of the Afro-Cuban Santer\u00eda religion. There are mentions of hard-bop and danz\u00f3n but also echoes of Bach, Rachmaninoff and Miles Davis -- and yet the sum total is a deeply personal and open-ended sound. And it\u2019s all Chucho Vald\u00e9s.\n\n\u201cSince I was a student I had this idea of taking disparate elements, mixing them and seeing what happened. And little by little, over time, I\u2019ve found my ways,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cAnd I love it because it\u2019s a search that forces you to investigate and study. It\u2019s not all about Afro-Cuban music. I\u2019m always looking for new things.\u201d\n\nThe concept in Border-Free \u201cwas to do many different things but all in my own style. Now, that is something very difficult to achieve.\u201d\n\nDionisio Jes\u00fas \"Chucho\" Vald\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, was born in a family of musicians in Quivic\u00e1n, Havana province, Cuba, October 9, 1941. His first teachers were his father, the pianist, composer and bandleader Ram\u00f3n \u201cBebo\u201d Vald\u00e9s, and his mother Pilar Rodr\u00edguez, who sang and played the piano.\n\nAt the age of three, Chucho already played at the piano, using both hands, in any key, melodies he heard on the radio. In fact, there is a famous anecdote that tells the story of Bebo tricking his friend, the late Israel \u201cCachao\u201d Lopez, about checking out, with his back to the player, \u201ca young North American pianist.\u201d Chucho was then four years old.\n\nAt the age of five, Chucho began to take lessons on piano, theory and solfege with maestro Oscar Mu\u00f1oz Boufartique. He continued his studies at the Conservatorio Municipal de M\u00fasica de la Habana, from which he graduated at 14. Chucho also took private lessons from Zenaida Romeu, Rosario Franco, Federico Smith and Leo Brouwer.\n\n\u201cAt home he played jazz: the music of Ellington, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller\u2019s band. I\u2019ve been privileged. Because Bebo was the piano player at the Tropicana I could see true legend of jazz in person. He took me to see Nat King Cole, Errol Garner and Sarah Vaughan when I was child studying music. You can\u2019t imagine the effect that had on my life! It was enormous! Magical!\nAt 15 Chucho formed his first jazz trio end in December 1958 he worked as a pianist at the Deauville and St. John hotels in Havana. In 1959, he debuted with the orchestra Sabor de Cuba, directed by his father, Bebo. That band accompanied the top singers of that era such as Rolando Laserie, Fernando \u00c1lvarez and P\u00edo Leyva.\n\n\u201cMy father taught me everything about Cuban music, South American music, jazz, and how to work with an orchestra,\u201d reminisces Chucho. \u201c He gave me the piano chair, and stayed on as director, so I could learn how to work under a conductor. We did our shows and a million other things with that orchestra, including accompanying shows at the Havana Hilton. I learned a lot there. He is my idol, \u201che pauses, then continues. \u201cI don\u00b4t say was, my idol. He is my idol. He was my teacher. He still is.\u201d\n\nChucho\u2019s family and professional life took a dramatic turn in 1960 when his father left to work in Mexico and from there he moved to Europe, where he eventually settled. Bebo Vald\u00e9s never returned to Cuba. (Father and son saw each other again 18 years later at Carnegie Hall, where Chucho was debuting in the United States with his group Irakere. The relationship was fully restored in 2000, when they met again to play a duet on Calle 54, a film about Latin jazz by Oscar winning Spanish director Fernando Trueba. The father and son reunion culminated, musically, in Juntos Para Siempre, a 2007 duet recording that won both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy. Bebo Vald\u00e9s died on March 22, 2013. He was 94.)\n\nIn the early \u201860s, Chucho worked as a pianist at the Teatro Mart\u00ed (1961), the Sal\u00f3n Internacional del Hotel Habana Riviera (1963) and the orchestra of the Teatro Musical de la Habana (1964-67). In 1967, and after a suggestion of his old teacher, the great guitarist, composer and director Leo Brouwer, Chucho organized his own combo.\n\nStill, that same year he joins the important Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, then directed by maestros Armando Romeu and Rafael Somavilla. While a member of the orchestra, Chucho revisited the idea of a small group and, in 1970, he appeared at the Jazz Jamboree in Poland leading his own quintet.\n\nIn 1972, after recording Jazz Bat\u00e1, an album featuring an unusual jazz trio comprising bassist Carlos del Puerto and singer and percussionist Oscar Vald\u00e9s on bat\u00e1 (the traditional hourglass shaped drums used in the ritual music of the Orishas), Chucho decided to enlarge the group adding brass and trap drums. That\u00b4s the genesis, in 1973, of Irakere, a small, Cuban-style big band that played an explosive mix of jazz, rock, classical music and traditional Cuban music, including Afro-Cuban religious music and instruments.\n\n\u201cThe ideas for the brass have to do with the work we did with the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, which was a great big band,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cI tried to imitate that with four horns -- two trumpets, a alto and a tenor sax -- and with just that try to have the sound of a big band. Of course when you have monster players like Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, [trumpeter] Jorge Varona and [saxophonist] Carlos Averhoff you can write anything you want and it will work.\u201d\nIrakere first made its mark internationally in Finland in 1976. But the following year, the band was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie in a visit to Havana on a jazz cruise that also included pianist Earl \u201cFatha\u201d Hines and saxophonist Stan Getz. In 1978 the producer Bruce Lundvall, then president of CBS, signed the band for the label. Irakere debuted, unannounced, as \u201csurprise guests,\u201d at Carnegie Hall as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. As fate would have it, the program that night also featured pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, two of Chucho\u2019s main influences.\n\nSelections from Irakere\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival comprised the repertory of Irakere (CBS) their debut recording in the United States. The album won a Grammy as Best Latin Recording in 1979.\n\nThe group went on to create an extraordinary body of work that includes great dance recordings such as Homenaje a Beny Mor\u00e9 (Pimienta, 1989) and Indestructible (Sony, 1997); explorations of Afro-Cuban religious music such as Babal\u00fa Ay\u00e9 (Bemb\u00e9, 1999) featuring the great Orisha music singer L\u00e1zaro Ros; as well as ambitious projects such as Tierra En Trance (Are\u00edto, 1983) and Misa Negra (Messidor, 1987)\n\nIrakere\u2019s lineup went through many changes over the years. Throughout, Chucho remained as the one, great constant. But success had its costs. Except for the remarkable solo outing Lucama (Mission, 1986), his talent as a pianist was largely out of sight, obscured by his other obligations with the band.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1997, Chucho won his second Grammy for his work on Habana (Verve) as a member of trumpeter Roy Hargrove\u2019s Crisol. The following year, while not completely leaving Irakere behind, Chucho started a parallel career as a solo player and quartet leader, looking for greater opportunities to explore and showcase his playing.\n\n\u201cTwenty five years with the same band is a long time,\u201d said Chucho at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to play solo and with a quartet for some time now. My work as a pianist and soloist gets diluted in Irakere. My job in the group is to be the composer, arranger and musical director and that\u2019s a completely different role.\u201d\n\nChucho stayed with Irakere until 2005.\n\nThe fruitful period that followed is highlighted by albums such as Solo Piano (Blue Note, 1991), Solo: Live in New York (Blue Note, 2001) and New Conceptions (Blue Note, 2003), as well as quartet recordings such as Bele Bele en La Habana (Blue Note, 1998), Briyumba Palo Congo (Blue Note, 1999) and Live at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note, 2000), capturing a performance that features Chucho\u2019s sister, singer Mayra Caridad Vald\u00e9s . The recording won a Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album.\n\nThere were also Grammy awards for the already mentioned Juntos Para Siempre (Calle 54, 2007), the duet recording with Bebo; and for Chucho\u2019s Steps (Comanche, 2010), featuring his new group, the Afro-Cuban Messengers .\n\nIn total, Chucho has won five Grammys and three Latin Grammys.\n\nIn 2012, Chucho reorganized his Afro-Cuban Messengers which currently feature Yaroldy Abreu, percussion, Dreiser Durruthy Bombal\u00e9 , bat\u00e1 drums and voice; Reinaldo Meli\u00e1n, trumpet, Gast\u00f3n Joya, bass and Rodney Barreto, drums.\n\nHis most recent production, Border-Free, is yet another expression of the continuing musical search and evolution of Chucho Vald\u00e9s as a pianist, composer, arranger and director.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9040181.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "Genres: Latin-Jazz", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "SFJAZZ Center - Miner Auditorium"}, {"Address": "14831 Pierce Rd, Saratoga, CA 95070", "Artist": "Astro", "ArtistBio": "Born in Pasadena, California and growing up in Indianapolis, Mikel Lee has lived in many parts of the city including West Hollywood where he found a strong appreciation for modern art, fashion and pop culture.

College at University of Florida in Gainesville and a residency with the Vulgar Boatmen left him with a lifelong habit of Mudcrutch/Tom Petty-style crunchy guitar riffs. Chasing the punk prairie fire to New York just in time to sift through the ashes, he formed The Silos in 1985 with guitarist Bob Rupe and violinist Mary Rowell, plugging the main cable of American rock idiom into the jerry-rigged soundboard of Velvets-era feral experimentalism. The unlikely result, as evidenced by About Her Steps (1986), the seminal Cuba (1987) and their RCA debut The Silos (i.e., The One with the Bird on the Cover, 1990) was a loose-limbed conceptual country-rock that in turn influenced (if not outright inspired) the alt-country No Depression movement just around the corner. The band was voted Best New American Band in Rolling Stone Magazine's Critics' Poll of 1987 and appeared on Late Night with David Letterman in 1990.\n\nWith this apocalyptic agrarianism safely encoded in his band's name, Salas-Humara moved on once that lineup had run its course -- taking with him not the country revisionism that by now could have sustained him in an endless holding pattern, but rather the Lower East Side\u2019s fervid avant-gardism, that high-test mixture of aggression and dissonance the neighborhood wears like a jailhouse tattoo. He forged connections in Austin, another lost outpost tailor-made for his particular set of influences, where he formed the poor man\u2019s supergroup the Setters with songwriters Michael Hall of the Wild Seeds and Alejandro Escovedo of the True Believers. Moving to Los Angeles, he recorded and toured with Tom Freund, Manny Verzosa, Jon Dee Graham, Gary Sunshine and Darren Hess. Those middle records \u2013 Hasta la Victoria! (1992), Susan Across the Ocean (1994), Heater (and its remixed mutant twin Cooler) (1998) validated the early acclaim and expanded Salas-Humara\u2019s reputation as one of the finest songwriters working in the American vernacular. In 1998, Salas-Humara moved back to New York and formed Silos 3.0, with Konrad Meissner on drums and Drew Glackin on bass and guitar.\n\nThroughout the last decade, the Silos have continued to release an admirable body of work. Laser Beam Next Door (2001) and Come on Like the Fast Lane (2007) are fierce power trio albums that burst with the crackling intensity of proto-punk legends the Velvet Underground and Television. When the Telephone Rings (2004) and now Florizona (2011) are intricately crafted productions, densely layered with glittering detail. With the passing of Drew Glackin in 2008, and the addition of Rod Hohl (bass and guitars), Bruce Martin (keyboards) and Jason Victor (guitar), the band has entered a new phase. Walter Salas-Humara and Silos present and past have marshaled the best of America -- our wide tradition, focused innovation and unfettered optimism.

Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds retom\u00f3 sus inolvidables temas, los cuales anteriormente compuso para otros artistas y por primera vez los grab\u00f3, interpret\u00e1ndoles en su inconfundible estilo, con el mismo concepto musical dentro del g\u00e9nero Pop/rom\u00e1ntico de su legendario \u00e1lbum \u201cTrozos de Mi Alma\u201d (1999), \u00e1lbum que le dio muchas satisfacciones y cuantiosas certificaciones, por sus altas ventas tales como: RIAA Oro y Platino en Estados Unidos, Diamante en M\u00e9xico y Platino en Am\u00e9rica Latina. \u201cTrozos De Mi Alma 2\u201d es un \u00e1lbum de 10 magn\u00edficos temas tales como: \u201cAntes De Que Te Vayas\u201d (tema el cual fue interpretado por Laura Flores y el Grupo Indio), \u201cQui\u00e9n Se Enamor\u00f3\u201d, \u201cTe Voy Esperar\u201d, \u201cHay Veces\u201d, (un bolero cl\u00e1sico), \u201cP\u00eddemelo Todo\u201d, \u201cExtra\u00f1\u00e1ndote\u201d y \u201cYo Cre\u00eda Que S\u00ed\u201d (ambos interpretados por Roci\u00f3 Durcal), \u201cDios Bendiga Nuestro Amor\u201d (interpretado por Marisela), \u201cOjal\u00e1\u201c y \u201cNo Puedo Olvidarla\u201d. El primer sencillo que logro alcanzar los primeros lugares de popularidad radial fue \u201cAntes de Que Te Vayas,\u201d un tema rom\u00e1ntico de grandes matices, el cual fue tema principal de la telenovela mexicana \u2018Mundo de Fieras\u2019, que se transmiti\u00f3 en M\u00e9xico y Estados Unidos. El proceso de grabaci\u00f3n de esta producci\u00f3n... se realiz\u00f3 de la siguiente manera: la voz, coros y mezcla fueron grabados en Los \u00c1ngeles y un equipo compuesto por Pablo Aguirre (Arreglista y Co-productor) y el ingeniero Benny Faccone viajaron a Londres para grabar la sesi\u00f3n de cuerdas para este \u00e1lbum, en los hist\u00f3ricos estudios de Abbey Road, legendario estudio en donde grabaron Los Beatles. Para Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds fue una experiencia inolvidable el poder grabar en los estudios Abbey Road, el estar en un espacio en donde el esp\u00edritu de la creatividad est\u00e1 presente a toda hora. \u201cTrozos De Mi Alma 2\u201d es un disco musicalmente variado, el cual nos provoca un estado de \u00e1nimo diverso, a trav\u00e9s de la tem\u00e1tica de cada canci\u00f3n ya sean: boleros, r\u00edtmicas y baladas, acompa\u00f1adas de \u2018la cuerda cl\u00e1sica\u2019 que seg\u00fan el propio Marco es el \u2018vestido ideal\u2019 para los temas rom\u00e1nticos Tanto la elaboraci\u00f3n de la producci\u00f3n musical, como la fotograf\u00eda del \u00e1lbum fueron cuidadosamente realizadas. Parte de este equipo que viaj\u00f3 a Londres fue el reconocido fot\u00f3grafo mexicano Nicol\u00e1s Felizola, el cual se encarg\u00f3 de captar esos momentos especiales para llevarlos al arte del \u00e1lbum. El concepto de la fotograf\u00eda fue urbano, en las calles, los paisajes y algunos interiores del hotel en la ciudad de Londres. En cuanto al video, podemos decir que es sin duda, el video m\u00e1s dram\u00e1tico e intenso de la carrera del cantautor, en donde la trama de la historia relata un accidente automovil\u00edstico en donde Marco Antonio Solis pierde la vida. Bajo la direcci\u00f3n del reconocido director Gustavo Garz\u00f3n, el video del sencillo \u201cAntes De Que Te Vayas\u201d se grab\u00f3 durante 16 horas en la ciudad de Miami, con la actuaci\u00f3n especial de la popular actriz mexicana Karime Lozano. Con esta producci\u00f3n Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds solidific\u00f3 su popularidad a trav\u00e9s de varios pa\u00edses en Centro Am\u00e9rica: Panam\u00e1, El Salvador y Guatemala en donde logr\u00f3 reunir a m\u00e1s 22,000 personas.

En tono po\u00e9tico pero sencillo, con depurado estilo y una personal visi\u00f3n de la vida, en este disco aborda situaciones cotidianas, de amor y desamor, llenas de un profundo romanticismo y con letras que tocan las fibras m\u00e1s \u00edntimas del sentimiento. Producci\u00f3n balanceada, con ritmos muy queridos por nuestra gente latina, el \u00e1lbum \"Tu Amor O Tu Desprecio\" incluye diez temas, nueve de la autor\u00eda de Marco Antonio y uno de Rafael Rosas. 2001... \u201cM\u00e1s De Mi Alma\u201d \"M\u00e1s De Mi Alma\" fue un acierto cuyo primer sencillo titulado \"O Me Voy o Te Vas\" logr\u00f3 colocarse en los primeros sitios de popularidad en Estados Unidos y M\u00e9xico.

Gracias a sus producciones previas, sobre todo a \"Trozos De Mi Alma\", realiz\u00f3 giras de presentaciones personales y de promoci\u00f3n en Estados Unidos, M\u00e9xico y Am\u00e9rica Latina. Para entonces Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds es piedra angular de la m\u00fasica rom\u00e1ntica, reafirm\u00e1ndose como el m\u00e1s grande cantautor de todos los tiempos. Su historia lo confirma.

La espa\u00f1ola Roc\u00edo Durcal pidi\u00f3 a Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds que se encargara de darle continuidad a su carrera. Y s\u00ed, con su vital aporte, lo consigui\u00f3.

A principios de los a\u00f1os 70 junto con su primo Joel Sol\u00eds, inici\u00f3 un sue\u00f1o musical que finalmente culmin\u00f3 con la creaci\u00f3n de Los Bukis. En su adolescencia Joel y Marco improvisaban en todo tipo de instrumentos dando rienda suelta a su imaginaci\u00f3n. Marco Antonio ya daba muestras de tener el don de int\u00e9rprete y adem\u00e1s escrib\u00eda temas nacidos de sus sue\u00f1os. Desde el principio tuvo bien clara la idea de ser cantante y compositor, oficio al cual se ha dedicado en cuerpo y alma. Sus primeras canciones ya ten\u00edan ese \"algo\" que solamente pueden imprimirle los grandes maestros de la m\u00fasica popular. Una flor, un paisaje, un rostro, una sonrisa, un adi\u00f3s, el amor o desamor han sido para \u00e9l motivos que se plasman en versos y en m\u00fasica. Todas sus producciones con Los Bukis tuvieron un tono ascendente, super\u00e1ndose una tras otra y a tal grado que el p\u00fablico estaba siempre sediento de o\u00edr todo lo nuevo que entregaba este gran artista de origen michoacano, quien ha sido un ejemplo y gu\u00eda para muchos en la m\u00fasica popular y rom\u00e1ntica. ...Sus Primeras Grabaciones Con el paso de los a\u00f1os Marco como productor y m\u00fasico ha enriquecido de muchas maneras a la industria del disco. En cada una de las producciones de Los Bukis desde \"Falso Amor\" hasta \"Una Mujer Como T\u00fa\" introdujo las t\u00e9cnicas de grabaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s modernas. El primer reconocimiento en el \u00e1mbito internacional hacia su obra le fue otorgado por el disco que grab\u00f3 a finales de 1982 y que en 1984 fue nominado al GRAMMY\u00ae, donde el tema \"Yo Te Necesito\" acapar\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n por su \u00e9xito en Estados Unidos. Marco Antonio se consagr\u00f3 como compositor, arreglista y productor del disco con la grabaci\u00f3n de Los Bukis \"Mi Fantas\u00eda\" en 1984 y a partir de entonces ya nada ni nadie detuvo el impresionante avance de su concepto. Su siguiente producci\u00f3n \"A D\u00f3nde Vas\", realizada en 1985, fue otra muestra de su inagotable inspiraci\u00f3n y talento. Otra de sus canciones, \"Tu C\u00e1rcel\", hizo historia en Latinoam\u00e9rica al vender por vez primera m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n y medio de copias, suceso con que Los Bukis obtuvieron el primer Disco de Diamante que se haya entregado a un artista de habla hispana. En sus a\u00f1os como l\u00edder, compositor, arreglista, productor y cantante de Los Bukis su figura siempre destac\u00f3. Pero \u00e9l sin ego\u00edsmo invariablemente ped\u00eda a la prensa que tambi\u00e9n conocieran el punto de vista de sus compa\u00f1eros en el grupo. Una an\u00e9cdota interesante de Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds fue cuando a Los Bukis se les invit\u00f3 como \u00fanicos artistas para participar en la celebraci\u00f3n de los 450 a\u00f1os de la fundaci\u00f3n de la ciudad de Morelia, capital del estado que lo vio nacer. Ante m\u00e1s de 150 mil personas dieron el concierto m\u00e1s exitoso de toda la historia de esa ciudad. Al finalizar el ciclo de Los Bukis, en pleno \u00e9xito, Marco es galardonado una vez m\u00e1s en Miami con varios trofeos del premio 'Lo Nuestro', por su producci\u00f3n \"Por Amor A Mi Pueblo\". Adem\u00e1s, en esa s\u00e9ptima edici\u00f3n del reconocimiento recibe el Premio A La Excelencia Musical de manos de Gloria Estefan. A esta distinci\u00f3n s\u00f3lo se han hecho acreedores figuras como la propia Gloria Estefan, Juan Gabriel, Julio Iglesias, Celia Cruz, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Antonio Aguilar y Joan Sebasti\u00e1n. Concluida la era de Los Bukis, Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds se impuso otro gran reto: triunfar como solista. Y lo ha conseguido a plenitud. Con prof\u00e9tico instinto su primera producci\u00f3n en este cap\u00edtulo de su vida se titul\u00f3 \"En Pleno Vuelo\". Desde entonces las alas de su inspiraci\u00f3n, el carisma de su presencia esc\u00e9nica tocando diversos instrumentos, la fina artesan\u00eda de su trabajo en el estudio, la suma perfecta de su repertorio y el definido timbre de su voz lo han elevado a la categor\u00eda de las leyendas vivientes.

Touring full time for over the past seven years has not only separated F.O.W. from other acts, but has created a well-oiled rock, funk, reggae, and hip-hop machine. The patience of founding members Brandon and Kyle Moon has finally come to fruition this past year. Their 5th and most sonically sophisticated album Married to the Music has hit the road with them as they promote the album in a non-stop U.S. winter tour through March 2018. The buzz on this album has been growing in the music community and is being submitted to the Grammy\u2019s for \u201cBest Album by a New Artist\u201d. Their hit single on the album Chicken & Blunts was in the top 100 downloaded singles on iTunes for over 3 weeks and features MC J-Sneez from Myrtle Beach, SC.\n\nGrowing up together as cousins born one month apart, Kyle and Brandon started the band in San Luis Obispo, CA and later moved to Southern California to pursue a larger demographic. Playing all original rock, funk, reggae, and hip-hop, they coined the phrase RoPhunk RaeHop (pronounced \u201crow-funk-ray-hop\u201d) and stands for rock, funk, reggae, hip-hop. The two switch between bass and guitar (circa Slightly Stoopid) and share duties on vocals. They began to do monster tours coast to coast and eventually, through their touring in the Hawaiian Islands, landed in Sydney, Australia Oct. 2014 with over 40 shows in two months up and down the east coast. Since then, they have returned two more times and have a European tour scheduled for spring of 2018.\n\nThe group has performed well over 3,000 shows since 2000 and shared the stage with The Wailers, Fishbone, G-Love, Groundation, and many more. They have been on the bill for 3 Falls Festival, Earthdance, Whole Earth Festival, SLO\u2019s Concert in the Plaza, and Panama City Beach\u2019s Summer Concert Series.\n\nTheir discography consists of five all original albums including their first full-length acoustic album Heart the Hand. Providing the most diverse show on the planet, Fish Out of Water continues to keep people guessing and more importantly, keep people dancing. The rock takes you back to a day where musicians did really rock and the hip-hop is a conscious flow over a rhythmic hip dropping beat. The reggae has a heavy ska influence but can also be a \u201cone drop\u201d smoke anthem. And the funk? Well the funk is the best part about F.O.W. Both cousins play a mean slap bass and current drummer Stephan Burns is a groove player, out of Myrtle Beach as well, with a knack for finding tasty chops on all of the material the Moon\u2019s compose.\n\nAlways giving back to the community, the Fish are involved with the Wesley Burnham Foundation helping to hand out ukuleles to underprivileged youth throughout their travels. Proving their mantra Pump the Funk and Increase the Peace (P.F.I.P.) isn\u2019t just talk, the group has given over 35 ukulele\u2019s away in the past six months.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8399851.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.68, 38.28], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Funk, Reggae, Hip Hop", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Twin Oaks Roadhouse"}, {"Address": "859 O'Farrell St, San Francisco, CA 94109", "Artist": "DRAMA", "ArtistBio": "You need more DRAMA in your life.

He composes, arranges, collaborates, improvises and has even been known to sing a song here and there in both English and Italian. But what he does create on the guitar makes the difference between simply playing and truly making music apparent in the most wonderful ways.\n\n\n\nD\u2019Agostino has been hailed as \u201ca guitarist\u2019s guitarist\u201d by Acoustic Guitar magazine as well as \u201ca giant of the acoustic guitar\u201d (San Diego Reader), and holds many top guitar awards, but the San Francisco Chronicle encapsulated the essential difference that distinguishes D\u2019Agostino\u2019s music when it dubbed him \u201ca poet.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat poetic eloquence, grace and magic suffuses Nine White Kites, his first album of new compositions for the guitar in a decade (during which time he\u2019s done much else wonderful with his musical talents). The set of 11 songs and two bonus tracks launches with the soaring fingerpicking of the title track, leading the listener through a tour de force showcase of D\u2019Agostino\u2019s mastery and artistry.\n\n\n\nNumbers like \u201cBarefoot in Rio\u201d (on which D\u2019Agostino makes a rare appearance on nylon string guitar), \u201cCowboy Minestrone\u201d (an homage to master country picker Jerry Reed) and \u201cReggae Ragu\u201d travel through spots on the musical globe where he finds stylistic inspiration to blend with his own international roots, while \u201cSan Francisco 1982\u201d revisits the allure of the city he first visited on vacation that year and soon after returned to and made his home. \u201cStreet Pulse\u201d bristles with a kinetic urban energy, \u201cImminent Dawn\u201d evokes the mystical junction of night becoming day, \u201cJump Rope\u201d is a stunning showcase of guitar athleticism and dexterousness, and the sparse and subdued \u201cSilence In Between\u201d captures the music in the space among the notes. \u201cClare\u2019s Gifts\u201d and \u201cSweet Sylvia\u201d are D\u2019Agostino\u2019s musical Mona Lisas that paint women on guitar. D\u2019Agostino wraps it up with two Italiano melodic deserts on the bonus tracks: \u201cNella Fantasia,\u201d an Ennio Morricone melody (originally \u201cGabriel\u2019s Oboe\u201d in the film The Mission) with lyrics by Chiara Ferrau, beautifully sung by Peppino\u2019s daughter Aleza, and the spry folk classicism of \u201cLa Gazza Ladra.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a listen to Nine White Kites, It\u2019s no wonder that Acoustic Guitar says that D\u2019Agostino is \u201cone of the most capable composers among fingerstyle guitarists\u201d while the San Jose Mercury News notes his \u201cgift for writing emotionally evocative tunes.\u201d The title reflects the fact that \u201cmusic is weightless,\u201d D\u2019Agostino observes. \u201cBut if you think about it, it can create very deep and heavy feelings. The kite is very light, like music, but it also can evoke feelings. Plus it symbolizes a sense of freedom, and kites are universal, found all around the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nA native of Italy, D\u2019Agostino has made his considerable international mark as a musical artist on the guitar since he arrived in America a little over 25 years ago. The readers of Guitar Player voted him Best Acoustic Guitarist in 2007, and the following year in Acoustic Guitar\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards he won a Bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time for his 2002 release Every Step of The Way (tying with Leo Kottke, one of his prime inspirations) and another Bronze award as Fingerstyle Guitarist of the Year. But as said above, it\u2019s not just his talent that makes D\u2019Agostino so notable, but also what he does with it.\n\n\n\nThe Chicago Tribune praises his \u201cvirtuosity and complexity\u201d as well as his gift for composing \u201cmemorable melodies.\u201d He is also an \u201castonishing entertainer\u201d (Anchorage Daily News). Yet it\u2019s what Guitar One has noted as his \u201clyrical artistry\u201d and fellow master player Adrian Legg describes as the \u201cwarm humanity\u201d of his playing that has earned him the stature of being a \u201cphenom,\u201d as Jazziz raves.\n\n\n\nHow has D\u2019Agostino earned such high praise and honors? \u201cMusic is not only what you know musically, but also what you experience in life, because it is a reflection of our personalities and spirit,\u201d he explains. In his playing and writing one feels his heart, spirit, soul and essence as well as your own.\n\n\n\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 10 when he heard his cousin play in church. After D\u2019Agostino got a few lessons from the cousin, he embarked on a journey of self-study and further exploration on the guitar and in music that continues today. So in addition to his \u201ctechnical prowess\u201d (Guitar One), he displays a stunning stylistic range in his work that spans classical to pop music and incorporates a spectrum of folk, ethnic and world styles. From his teens into his twenties, D\u2019Agostino learned about and absorbed many musical colors and flavors, being so enthralled with all to know about music and his chosen instrument that he went AWOL one night from the Italian Army to catch a concert by some acoustic guitarists he admired.\n\n\n\nAfter making his recorded mark in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later \u2014 both discs collaborations with fellow players that set the stage for many to follow \u2014 he moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants and then clubs and concerts after a fellow musician introduced D\u2019Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records, and has since issued six more albums prior to Nine White Kites, the most recent being Made in Italy, a musical travelogue through the songs and composers of the country where he was born and came of age.\n\n\n\nHe has released the collaborations Classic/Steel (2001) with contemporary classical guitar master David Tanenbaum and Bayshore Road (2005) with his close friend and virtuoso electric player Stef Burns. D\u2019Agostino also performs and has recorded with the United Guitar Ensemble, which features his steel string guitar alongside eight nylon string classical masters.\n\n\n\nHe has also released three instructional/performance DVDs as well as the book New Acoustic Guitar (Warner Bros. Publications), and also designed his signature Seagull guitar with innovative guitar maker Robert Godin that won a Silver People\u2019s Choice Award for Acoustic Guitar of the Year from Acoustic Guitar magazine in 2008. A hot ticket live performer in North and South America and Europe, he charms audiences with performances that are captivating and full-blooded musical experiences.\n\n\n\n\u201cI play Brazilian music, Irish music, country music, blues, ragtime, classical,\u201d he says of just some of the many styles heard within what he creates. Inspired by such diverse players as Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, among many others, his influences also include the progressive rockers like Genesis, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Mike Oldfield he listened to in his teens and early adulthood.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my curiosity,\u201d D\u2019Agostino explains. \u201cA lot of people stay within a frame and say they play blues and they play blues all their life. And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not judging anyone. But the way my brain works I need to explore different styles and what\u2019s available there and what\u2019s possible and what others do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPeppino writes wonderful guitar pieces,\u201d says Kottke of his onetime acolyte. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorite composers for this cranky instrument. Plus, he\u2019s a tone player. I love his sound\u2026 [he] gets the resin and the wood.\u201d\n\n\n\nD\u2019Agostino likens his musical approach to the culinary artistry of his native Italy. \u201cIf you only know about tomatoes, garlic and basil, you will only make a certain kind of sauce.

It might sound weird, but I assure you they do not! Their second album, \u00abVinyl and a Heartache\u00bb, was released in 2016. Since then they have played concerts all over the world, been listed on several radio channels and booked to some of the biggest festivals in Norway, streamed more than three million times on Spotify, played SXSW in Austin and AmericanaFest in Nashville and supported Lucinda Williams and Sam Outlaw. The before-mentioned album also won a Norwegian Grammy.\n\nAs such, the last twelve months of Darling West\u2019s musical career can hardly be described as anything but fantastic.\nDespite all this, the band has no plans of resting on their acquired laurels, and have already unveiled three singles from the album they plan to release early in 2018.\n\nThey haven't changed that much since \"Vinyl and a Heartache\", but one can still hear a slightly different and revitalized Darling West. Relentless touring and playing big festival stages has served as a catalyst to give them more edge and confidence. While continuing to play their sweet Americana/Folk/Country, the music has more drive and the melodies are catchier than before.\n\nThere\u2019s a feeling the next year might be even more eventful for them.

College at University of Florida in Gainesville and a residency with the Vulgar Boatmen left him with a lifelong habit of Mudcrutch/Tom Petty-style crunchy guitar riffs. Chasing the punk prairie fire to New York just in time to sift through the ashes, he formed The Silos in 1985 with guitarist Bob Rupe and violinist Mary Rowell, plugging the main cable of American rock idiom into the jerry-rigged soundboard of Velvets-era feral experimentalism. The unlikely result, as evidenced by About Her Steps (1986), the seminal Cuba (1987) and their RCA debut The Silos (i.e., The One with the Bird on the Cover, 1990) was a loose-limbed conceptual country-rock that in turn influenced (if not outright inspired) the alt-country No Depression movement just around the corner. The band was voted Best New American Band in Rolling Stone Magazine's Critics' Poll of 1987 and appeared on Late Night with David Letterman in 1990.\n\nWith this apocalyptic agrarianism safely encoded in his band's name, Salas-Humara moved on once that lineup had run its course -- taking with him not the country revisionism that by now could have sustained him in an endless holding pattern, but rather the Lower East Side\u2019s fervid avant-gardism, that high-test mixture of aggression and dissonance the neighborhood wears like a jailhouse tattoo. He forged connections in Austin, another lost outpost tailor-made for his particular set of influences, where he formed the poor man\u2019s supergroup the Setters with songwriters Michael Hall of the Wild Seeds and Alejandro Escovedo of the True Believers. Moving to Los Angeles, he recorded and toured with Tom Freund, Manny Verzosa, Jon Dee Graham, Gary Sunshine and Darren Hess. Those middle records \u2013 Hasta la Victoria! (1992), Susan Across the Ocean (1994), Heater (and its remixed mutant twin Cooler) (1998) validated the early acclaim and expanded Salas-Humara\u2019s reputation as one of the finest songwriters working in the American vernacular. In 1998, Salas-Humara moved back to New York and formed Silos 3.0, with Konrad Meissner on drums and Drew Glackin on bass and guitar.\n\nThroughout the new millennium, the Silos have continued to release an admirable body of work. Laser Beam Next Door (2001) and Come on Like the Fast Lane (2007) are fierce power trio albums that burst with the crackling intensity of proto-punk legends the Velvet Underground and Television. When the Telephone Rings (2004) and\nFlorizona (2011) are intricately crafted productions, densely layered with glittering detail. With the passing of Drew Glackin in 2008, and the addition of Rod Hohl (bass and guitars), Bruce Martin (keyboards) and Jason Victor (guitar), the band has entered a new phase. Walter Salas-Humara and Silos present and past have marshaled the best of America -- our wide tradition, focused innovation and unfettered optimism. Embrace them as a national treasure.\n\n2014 brought the release of a new Walter Salas-Humara solo album, Curve and Shake. Rolling Stone editor Anthony DeCurtis describes the album - \u201cThat sense of being untethered from certainties, of floating, permeates Curve and Shake. The feeling is gentle, not quite scary, but with an element of unease. Letting go of expectations combines aspects of sadness, freedom and even wonder. Like so many great singers, Walter communicates as much by what he doesn\u2019t say as by what he does. His raspy tone provides a rich counterpoint to the genial surrealism, the offhand magical realism, of so many of his lyrics. His words are presented as if they\u2019re describing straightforward events, but they speak a rich, associative poetry that evokes emotions more so than facts. His guitar playing is similarly adaptable \u2013 raw and stinging one moment, dreamy and droning the next.\n\n2016 has brought the release of 2 new albums. Work: Part One, an acoustic rendering of Walter's best songs written in the 80s, is the first in a series of acoustic albums defining Walter as a singer/songwriter. It is produced by guitarist extraordinaire Richard Brotherton and includes familiar Silos Mary Rowell on violin and Amy Allison on supporting voice. Explodes and Disappears is an album of new songs, the follow up to Curve and Shake. Walter sings witty songs about modern life, rocks a sweet Spanish melody on guitar, swings a sexy jazz number, and then reaches deep for a soulful expression of values in a troubled world. He tops it all with a funky number chronicling 3 American misfits searching for peace of mind and headed for disaster on the shores of Mexico -- all skillfully blended into a seamless flow.\n\nWalter Salas-Humara has shared the stage with the following greats: Wilco, Lucinda Williams, Matthew Sweet, American Music Club, Chris Whitley, Hootie and The Blowfish, Violent Femmes, The Jayhawks, Yo La Tengo, Certain General, The Reivers, The True Believers, The Wild Seeds, Victoria Williams, Willard Grant Conspiracy, Mark Ribot, Ryan Adams, Jon Dee Graham, Alejandro Escovedo, Let's Active, Young Fresh Fellows, Miracle Legion, Living Color, Souled American, The Minus 5, Steve Wynn and the Miracle 3, Jon Langford, The Waco Brothers, Chuck Prophet, Jerry Joseph, Caitlin Cary, Anders Parker, Tom Freund, Centro-Matic, Spottiswoode and his Enemies, Lynyrd Skynyrd, \u2026to name a few.\n\nVISUAL ARTS\n\nHaving first moved to New York in 1982 to pursue a career in the visual arts, and having completed a year of graduate work at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, Salas-Humara found steady work with the Leo Castelli Gallery during the \u201880s Manhattan art boom. Citing as his heroes \u201850s minimalist painter Ellsworth Kelly and Pop artist Jasper Johns, Salas-Humara\u2019s early paintings were primarily large abstract color fields. His art career was cut short with the success of the Silos three years later.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Salas-Humara took up painting again after a hiatus of two decades. On a whim, he created several stylized, cartoon-like dog paintings as holiday gifts for his nieces and nephews. They became so popular that he was soon spending much of his free time painting commissioned dog portraits in his signature style for friends and fans. In 2005, he formed a company called WaltersDogs and began producing originals and prints for sale at shows, by mail-order and in music-oriented art galleries like Yard Dog in Austin, eventually expanding his product line to include apparel, accessories, bedding and stationery products.\n\n\u201cI create paintings that combine qualities of the abstract art I like with fun imagery that anybody can relate to, even kids,\u201d he says.\n\nHis dog paintings can be seen on the walls of Elisabeth Moss\u2019s apartment in the 2010 Universal Pictures comedy Get Him to the Greek.\n\nRELATED WEBSITES\nWSH - waltersalashumara.com\nThe Silos - thesilos.net\nWaltersDogs - waltersdogs.com\nWalter Salas-Humara Wiki", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8502444.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.685106, 37.910178], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Americana, Singer, Songwriter, Alternative, Alternative Country-Rock", "OtherInfo": "I cannot wait to return this insanely fun venue.

Born in 1993 in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, SCI has since released 10 albums, 5 DVDs and countless live recordings from their relentless tour schedule. Their 14 year history is packed full of surreal experiences, epic moments, groundbreaking involvement and huge accomplishments. They have been recognized for their commitment to musical creativity and integrity, for their community spirit, philanthropic endeavors, and for their innovative approach to the business of music. When The String Cheese Incident\u2019s growth first started gaining momentum over a decade ago, the internet was just beginning to take hold and the major-label business model was failing; the band decided then to make music on their own terms. Since then, The String Cheese Incident has gone on to carve out a completely different approach to the business of music; they are truly pioneers of the new way of \u201cmaking a band.\u201d With the World Wide Web as their tool, SCI was among the first artists to disseminate information via the internet - such as tour dates, release information, and other news - to their growing fan base. Rather than doing business on such terms as \u201cthe bottom line,\u201d The String Cheese Incident put their music and their fans first, offering such fan services as ticketing, travel, and merchandise to best serve their community. The band\u2019s record label, SCI Fidelity Records, has always operated under the same ideals. Even early on, SCI Fidelity embraced downloadable music and file sharing, delivering SCI\u2019s \u201cOn the Road\u201d series, where every show the band plays is made available for download on the internet. Whether they realized it at the time or not, The String Cheese Incident was inventing grassroots band development. Today, literally thousands of bands are using some version of this same approach to building a band. The String Cheese Incident\u2019s commitment goes well beyond their immediate community, and even beyond the music community as a whole. Early on, the band took a serious interest in giving back to the communities that they visited, and they were among the first performers to encourage \u201cGreen\u201d shows and tours. SCI\u2019s support has helped give rise to such not-for-profit organizations as Conscious Alliance, Rock the Earth, and Head Count. In 2002, when the band\u2019s right to sell tickets to their own shows became threatened by ticketing giant Ticketmaster, the band stood strong for the independent music community and filed a lawsuit against the company. All the while, The String Cheese Incident has stayed committed to music as a creative endeavor, not just in their recordings but also in their live performances. The list of SCI\u2019s special guests and collaborators is long and diverse. Their annual events such as Horning\u2019s Hideout and holiday shows such as New Year\u2019s and Halloween have helped redefine the concert experience and has garnered the band a reputation as live music vibe innovators. \u266b ROOTS RUN DEEP \u266b", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6386811.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.27017, 37.80785], "Date": "Sat Oct 5 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-05", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Country, Jam, Bluegrass", "OtherInfo": "There is a delivery delay until 6/1.", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Fox Theater"}, {"Address": "2036 University Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Midnight", "ArtistBio": "By now, Midnight need no introduction.

El tema \u201cRama Seca\u201d es el que les abre las puertas de la disquera BMG, la cual los firma y les produce su primer disco del mismo nombre. \u201cTU MIRADA\u201d es el t\u00edtulo de su segunda producci\u00f3n que tambi\u00e9n es grabada bajo el sello de BMG. Su tercer disco titulado \u201cLA AUSENCIA\u201d fue el primero que grabaron para su propio sello Terrazas Records, marcando con \u00e9ste, lo que ser\u00eda el inicio de sus m\u00faltiples \u00e9xitos. Posteriormente, para cuando grabaron el disco \u201cLOS PRIMOS DE BALTAZAR\u201d; el grupo ya empezaba a figurar como un fen\u00f3meno musical, rompiendo r\u00e9cords de taquilla en sus presentaciones. \u201cCON SABOR A TAMBORAZO\u201d, fue su quinta producci\u00f3n con la que inmediatamente acapararon la atenci\u00f3n del p\u00fablico, anim\u00e1ndose a grabar su sexto disco totalmente en vivo. Despu\u00e9s de 6 producciones, Jos\u00e9 Luis Terrazas acepta la invitaci\u00f3n que la disquera transnacional Disa Latin Music le hace para formar parte de su elenco, grabando de inmediato el primer disco para este sello titulado \u201cEL SUBE Y BAJA\u201d. Demostrando que el pasito duranguense no era exclusivo de la ciudad de los vientos, se lanz\u00f3 en octubre del 2003, el disco \u201cDE DURANGO A CHICAGO\u201d, s\u00f3lo superado en las listas de Billboard por el \u00e1lbum \u201c33\u201d de Luis Miguel. Para el a\u00f1o 2004, en agradecimiento a la ciudad que los vio formarse musicalmente, grabaron el disco titulado \u201cEN VIVO DESDE CHICAGO\u201d, el cual debut\u00f3 en la posici\u00f3n n\u00famero uno de Billboard. Tanto es el auge de la onda duranguense, que Disa decidi\u00f3 realizar un producto especial con varios artistas del g\u00e9nero, sin embargo; la peculiaridad de esta producci\u00f3n titulada \u201cQUE CHIDO! EL PASITO DURANGUENSE\u201d es la magistral participaci\u00f3n que tiene MONT\u00c9Z DE DURANGO. Previo a lanzar en el 2005 su producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica, MONT\u00c9Z DE DURANGO particip\u00f3 de manera especial en un disco titulado \u201cLAS MAS BAILABLES DEL PASITO DURANGUENSE.

As a result, singer/guitarist Curt Kirkwood, bassist Cris Kirkwood, and drummer Shandon Sahm have an instant Meat Puppets classic on their hands, and an album that fits in perfectly with such mid '80s classics as 'Up on the Sun' and the underrated 'Mirage' (while not coming off as an attempt to recreate a certain musical era of the group). Interestingly however, the Meat Puppets did not achieve this by working out the songs' arrangements beforehand, or even extensively rehearsing together. \"This one here was an experiment in just viewing the parts as Tinkertoys, and seeing the little Tinkertoy circus that needed to be built, and putting it together simply like that,\" explains Curt. \"With just the band in the studio and the engineer, we didn't learn the songs - we just went in the studio, and went, 'OK, here's your part. Now play this good.' So we cut the stuff on acoustic guitar and drums first, and then built it. It's an interesting concept of a way to do something. It seems like it might be a stiff way to do something, by just putting it together a piece at a time like that. But I really enjoyed it. I think the overall sound of the way it came out is kind of a contradiction of the way it was recorded. To me, that's the coolest thing - to put something together like that, so you have the sum of the parts, and then the whole. The whole thing about the whole being greater than the sum of the parts. To force yourself to do it that way. We were able to keep track of the music.\" Produced once more by Curt, 'Lollipop' is the second Meat Puppets record to be released via Megaforce Records, and also signals the re-entry of former Puppets drummer Sahm back into the band (who previously played on the 2000 Puppets release, 'Golden Lies,' and supporting tour). Sahm- \"Come October [2009], Curt called. I said, 'Aren't you you supposed to be out on tour with the Stone Temple Pilots? What's up?' He said, 'Do you want to fill in and do these dates?' We only had one day to practice. That was the icebreaker. The first show was in Mobile, Alabama at BayFest. It was probably 5,000 to 10,000 people. Right afterwards, Robert and Dean DeLeo came up and said, 'You're really great in the band. You really drive the band cool. You should be in there.' And I was like, 'Well, I'm filling in for right now. It would be cool...talk to 'the boss'.' Robert goes, 'I'll talk to him.'

I think it's a fairly bitching effort, considering the amount of time we put into pre-work. I think it's indicative of where the band's at right now. It's a fairly fluid moment, and that's a trip, considering how long we've been at it and the band's history. Curt's been at it non-stop, and I'm pleased to be able to provide him with a stable outlet for his art.\" And according to Curt, the band got back to trusting their instincts once more - a major catalyst in their earlier work. \"The similarity between the '80s and now is that once we started getting a lot of attention in the '90s, we brought producers in and stuff, and there was a thing that started happening - and it might sound egotistical - but this band always ran off of my intuitions. As much as songwriting or anything else. I write intuitively, and I never wanted to be a songwriter - I just got into it when I had the band. I just wanted to be in a band. So it's all been this intuition of 'This is what we need to do.' This was kind of taken away from us in the '90s, as money came in and people said, 'You need to do this.' It clouded the whole easygoing...like, 'Well, what does Curt think?' You could say it was the money or it was the thrust of popularity stuff or the Nirvana thing. But it just was like the band as a whole quit trusting that, I think. We just became more compliant, and like they say, 'Cooperation leads to corruption.' So in this way, I think the album harkens back to that.\" To support 'Lollipop,' the Meat Puppets are planning on touring steadily, including the group's first substantial European tour in nearly two decades.

Upon completion of High School, she moved north to San Francisco where she continued to explore her love for the more underground sounds of electronic music. In the two years and a half since, Lindsey has continued to drift towards the darker realms of techno, constantly honing her craft as a DJ and getting involved with the thriving scene in San Francisco. Fast-forward to 2017 and Lindsey has truly become a recognized name in her city and beyond, in large part thanks to her unique signature sets -- true journeys that explore alternating soundscapes laced together by dark, deep and heavy textures, spatial melodies and relentless, gritty undertones. Lindsey\u2019s hard work over the years has paid off, gaining her residencies with San Francisco\u2019s Robot Ears for the past two years as well as Los Angeles\u2019 Invert Music Group. She has also played coveted gigs in Mexico, Detroit, and Magdeburg and in Germany, as well as most recently her debut in the legendary Tresor Berlin, playing alongside techno greats the likes of Chris Liebing, Function, Anthony Parasole, drumcell, Rebekah, Joel Mull, SNTS, Adam Beyer, Len Faki, and DVS1.

This early influence inspired him to create his laid-back, soulful blend of pop, rock, and reggae styles that he describes as \u201cquintessential California music\u201d.\n\nBut he says his music career really started 8 years ago in San Francisco, where he street performed 5 days a week in the hectic, carnival-like atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Dodging seagulls and competing with the other street performers for the tourists\u2019 attention, Sam\u2019s chops developed at an accelerated rate. \u201cThe first day I played in the wharf, I made $60. I knew one day I would make $600!\u201d In this way Sam supported himself full-time for more than 2 years - one CD at a time, one dollar at a time. He says \u201cit was like touring the world from a street corner.\u201d\n\nMany of the successes and relationships Sam has had since then are directly related to his time spent busking. During his street performing years, he made thousands of fans from all around the world who support him to this day. So much, in fact, that his fans fully funded his third EP \u201cThe City\u201d through Kickstarter, backing the project with nearly $10,000. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cThe City\u201d received airplay on San Francisco\u2019s Live 105 FM for several weeks.\n\nAlthough he is no longer street performing, Sam maintains a busy performance schedule with over 200 shows per year touring at college campuses across the US, performing at festivals, and corporate and private events, and the Ritz Carlton San Francisco invited him to be their resident performer, a spot which he has held for the past 5 years. In 2016, Sam joined top 40 artist Andy Grammer on his west coast tour, performing for thousands of fans each night as his opening act. Since then, Sam has shared stages with many big pop and reggae artists including Shwayze, Collie Buddz, Flipsyde, Common Kings, The Holdup, Leilani Wolfgramm, Anuhea, Mike Love, and more.\n\nSam\u2019s original music is also frequently featured in TV shows on MTV, FOX, NBC, BRAVO, and SPIKE. Macy\u2019s used Sam\u2019s version of \u201cIn The Midnight Hour\u201d for their popular nationwide Black Friday ad campaign for 2 years in a row. He has also written songs specifically for the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) that they keep in regular rotation.\n\nSam signed a deal with start-up label Text Me Records in 2018, and has since released half a dozen singles, with hundreds of thousands of Spotify plays, and his song \u201cFaded\u201d debuted at #3 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts.

The album is both his most personal statement yet and a summation of his career thus far. Robert Ellis opens with \u201cPerfect Strangers,\u201d a meditation on what brings people together (and how tenuous that connection can be), and ends with \u201cIt's Not OK,\u201d a raw look at emotional compromise. Between those two powerful bookends are nine other songs that set Ellis's soaring vocals and knowing melodies against his sharp, dark observations, and that show him in full command of a vibrant set of songwriting skills\u2014irony, distance, character, narrative, a thoughtful relationship between sound and sense.\n\n\n\nEllis was born and raised in Lake Jackson, a town about an hour from Houston whose other famous residents have included the Pauls (Ron and Rand) and Selena (the original Queen of Tejano, not the current pop sensation). From an early age, he escaped small-town boredom through music. At first, his tastes ran toward traditional hits. \u201cI remember having a bunch of pop records when I was really young: No Doubt and Michael Jackson and Garth Brooks. That was when I was pretty passive as a listener\u2014I liked them, but maybe I got to them because my mom or one of my sisters had them. The first I really got obsessed with was a Doc Watson collection. I was already starting to play guitar, and my uncle told my mom to get it for me. He was my first guitar hero.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs he developed as a writer, though, he found himself drawn toward the smartest and sharpest of the class of songwriters who developed in the 1970s: artists like Paul Simon, John Prine, and Randy Newman. And he didn\u2019t just listen to them. He learned from them. Specifically, he learned the finer points of songcraft. \u201cI've been a big fan of Paul Simon for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cHe has this capacity to surprise you with his music and his lyrics. With John Prine's songs, I grew from believing that they happened to him to understanding that it didn\u2019t matter if they really happened to him. And Randy Newman? Wow. I especially love a record like Trouble in Paradise, when there are all these artificial 1980s production techniques, but they\u2019re being used in the service of this master composer.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat respect for tradition\u2014but more specifically for the fact that so-called traditional artists were in fact consistent risk-takers\u2014fuel Ellis\u2019s new record. \u201cWith this record,\u201d he says, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve gotten to where I can use the material of my own life as a jumping-off point. But now I can do different things with that material.\u201d In this case, of course, the material has an element of melancholy. Much of the record revolves around the dissolution of Ellis\u2019s marriage. It\u2019s a breakup album, but not one that dissects its subject with straightforward rage and regret\u2014Ellis and his ex-wife remain friends, and she is even featured in the album art, which was created after the divorce. Rather, it\u2019s an album that finds Ellis reaching back into the trick bags of masters like Simon, Prine, and Newman, and employing the full complement of skills that he\u2019s learned from them. \u201c\u2018Perfect Strangers,\u2019 took a month,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a notepad and walked around New York, giving myself personal therapy through the eyes of the city.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther songs came faster. \u201cI wrote \u2018Elephant\u201d quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's about my misunderstanding of monogamy and my complete bewilderment with some of the ideas that I grew up with. I felt that in the past year, lots of constructs I took for granted were turned on their head. But I was careful to express those ideas in a way where the gray areas got to stay gray. If what you\u2019re saying is that you\u2019re confused, you shouldn't say you're confused. You should betray a contradiction.\u201d\n\n\n\nEllis isn\u2019t afraid of sophistication. The beautifully orchestrated \u201cYou\u2019re Not the One\u201d has more complex origins than its title might suggest. \u201cFor that one, I woke up from a nightmare that was a kind of sex dream. In the dream, the faces around me kept changing. It was very eerie, like a David Lynch movie. The song has that sense of unease but also this Ellington bridge that\u2019s unrelated to the key of the song. I\u2019m really proud of that one.\u201d But he can make his point with simplicity also, as in the chorus to \u201cDrivin\u2019,\u201d a co-write with Angaleena Presley: \u201cThis don\u2019t feel like living, it\u2019s just surviving / I\u2019m ain\u2019t going nowhere, I\u2019m just driving.\u201d And then there\u2019s \u201cHigh Road,\u201d the emotional center of the record, co-written with friend Jonny Fritz, a song about professional and personal insecurity that builds from lonesome shivers to almost operatic melodrama\u2014all the while riding a lovely, fragile melody.\n\n\n\nWhile Ellis wrote nine of the album\u2019s songs, he is also a generous collaborator dedicated to finding songs from other writers who advance his vision. \u201cOnce I knew that much of the record would be composed of these extremely personal songs like \u2018Elephant\u2019 or \u2018High Road,\u2019 but I was aware from the start that I couldn\u2019t have a whole record of them. Putting it together was like assembling a collection of short stories. You need different tones and colors. So that\u2019s why I included a song like \u2018How I Love You,\u2019 which was written by my friend Matt Vasquez, from Delta Spirit. We were hanging out, and I asked him if he had any good uptempo songs, and he showed me that one. And \u2018Screw\u2019 was written by Kelly Doyle, who plays guitar in our band. Listening to him work on his solo record, I was amazed by the sound. His process and palette were really inspirational to me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe album ends with \u201cIt's Not OK,\u201d which holds its ground as a traditional busted-love song before hurtling headlong into a dark thicket of guitars. \u201cIn that case, because the song is about that kind of emotional trouble, part of me that wanted dissonance and chaos. The melodic and rhythmic ideas to me are a different kind of information from the lyrics, but they\u2019re still information.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs thoughtful as Ellis is about the process, his album also has plenty of pop pleasures. \u201cCalifornia\u201d is a jaunty, intimate travelogue that elevates into his chorus. \u201cAmanda Jane\u201d has an almost bossa nova shuffle and a melody that splits the difference between power pop and 70s soft rock. And \u201cCouples Skate\u201d reaches back even further. \u201cI wrote that one while were on tour with Richard Thompson. It\u2019s a green room song. I was just journaling, and I remembered holding this girl\u2019s hand in second grade. It\u2019s a nostalgic idea, which is why I reached for a 50s soul vibe. But it\u2019s also nineties, in a way\u2014something about it that reminds me of the rock and roll I was listening to around that time.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the end, Robert Ellis (the album) is the most accurate reflection yet of Robert Ellis (the man). It\u2019s analytical and emotional, calculated in spots and improvisational in others, restless, peaceful, never indifferent, never dispassionate.\n\n\n\nROBERT ELLIS DISCOGRAPHY\n\nThe Great Rearranger (2009)\n\nPhotographs (2011)\n\nThe Lights From The Chemical Plant (2014)\n\nRobert Ellis (2016)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8984360.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Folk", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "11:00 AM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "Nikki Lane", "ArtistBio": "Nikki Lane\u2019s stunning third album Highway Queen, out February 17th, 2017, sees the young Nashville singer emerge as one of country and rock\u2019s most gifted songwriters. Co-produced by Lane and fellow singer-songwriter, Jonathan Tyler, this emotional tour-de-force was recorded at Matt Pence\u2019s Echo Lab studio in Denton, Texas as well as at Club Roar with Collin Dupuis in Nashville, Tennessee. Blending potent lyrics, unbridled blues guitars and vintage Sixties country-pop swagger, Lane\u2019s new music will resonate as easily with Lana Del Rey and Jenny Lewis fans as those of Neil Young and Tom Petty.\n\nHighway Queen is a journey through heartbreak that takes exquisite turns. The record begins with a whiskey-soaked homage to Lane\u2019s hometown (\u201c700,000 Rednecks\u201d) and ends on the profoundly raw \u201cForever Lasts Forever,\u201d where Lane mourns a failed marriage \u2013 the \u201clighter shade of skin\u201d left behind from her wedding ring. On \u201cForever\u201d and the confessional \u201cMuddy Waters,\u201d Lane\u2019s lyrics align her with perceptive songwriters like Nick Lowe and Cass McCombs. Elsewhere, \u201cCompanion\u201d is pure Everly Brothers\u2019 dreaminess (\u201cI would spend a lifetime/ Playing catch you if I can\u201d). She goes on a Vegas bender on the rollicking \u201cJackpot,\u201d fights last-call blues (\u201cFoolish Heart\u201d) and tosses off brazen one-liners at a backroom piano (\u201cBig Mouth\u201d).\n\n\u201cLove is the most unavoidable thing in the world,\u201d Lane says. \u201cThe person you pick could be half set-up to destroy your life with their own habits \u2013 I\u2019ve certainly experienced that before and taken way too long to get out of that mistake.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Lane\u2019s second album All or Nothin\u2019 (New West) solidified her sandpaper voice beneath a ten-gallon hat as the new sound and look of outlaw country music. Produced by Dan Auerbach, the record\u2019s bluesy Western guitars paired with Lane\u2019s Dusty Springfield-esque voice earned glowing reviews from NPR, the Guardian and Rolling Stone. In three years since her Walk of Shame debut, Lane said she was living most of the year on the road.\n\nGrowing up, Lane used to watch her father pave asphalt during blistering South Carolina summers. She\u2019d sit on the roller (\u201cwhat helps smooth out the asphalt\u201d) next to a guy named Rooster and divvy out Hardee\u2019s lunch orders for the workers. \u201cMy father thought he was a country singer,\u201d Lane laughs. \u201cHe partied hard at night, but by 6:30 AM he was out on the roads in 100-degree weather.\u201d That\u2019s the southern work ethic, she says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of money, but I was privileged with the knowledge of how to work hard, how to learn and to succeed when things aren\u2019t set up for me.\u201d Creativity was an unthinkable luxury, she adds. \u201cWhen people told me I should try to get a record deal for songs I was writing, I was like, \u2018that\u2019s cute \u2013 I\u2019ve got to be at work at 10 A.M.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBecoming a songwriter is one of the most selfish things I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Lane says plainly. She describes writing her first song at age 25 like it was a necessary act of self-preservation after a devastating breakup. Many of her early songs, she said on Shame and Nothin\u2019, were about the fleetingness of relationships she believed were permanent, she says. Lane\u2019s main line of work in those days was a fashion entrepreneur (she\u2019s currently the owner of Nashville\u2019s vintage clothing boutique High Class Hillbilly). It brought her to cities around the country, New York to Los Angeles to Nashville. And like a true wanderer, Lane\u2019s sound crisscrosses musical genres with ease, while the lonesome romantic in her remains. Even a soft song like, \u201cSend The Sun,\u201d with its lilting downward strum, is flush with bittersweet emotion. \u201cDarling, we\u2019re staring at the same moon,\u201d Lane sings lovingly. \u201cI used to say that to my ex,\u201d she says with cheerful stoicism, \u201cto try to brighten the long nights, stay positive.\u201d\n\nHighway Queen is poised to be Lane\u2019s mainstream breakthrough. \u201cAm I excited to spend years of my life in a van, away from family and friends? No, but I\u2019m excited to share my songs, so they\u2019ll reach people and help them get through whatever they\u2019re going through. To me, that\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLay You Down\u201d is one of those unexpected moments for Lane. \u201cThat song was inspired by something Levon Helm\u2019s wife posted on Facebook when he was sick with cancer,\u201d Lane says. \u201cI was just so moved by her telling the world how much love he felt from people writing to them, and moved that because of the Internet, I was able to see that love \u2013 even from a distance.\u201d The song became surreal for Lane and her band when her longtime guitarist, Alex Munoz, was diagnosed with cancer while they were playing it. \u201cIt deepened my perspective and the importance of keeping everyone safe,\u201d says Lane.\n\nOn the record cover, Lane looks out on wide, unowned Texan plains, leaning on the fearsome horns of a massive steer. Wearing a vintage Victorian dress, the stark photo invokes a time before highways existed. The symbolism isn\u2019t lost on Lane. Highway Queen was a pioneering moment for her as an artist.\n\n\u201cI was always a smart girl, always had to yell to be heard,\u201d she says, \u201cBut this was the first time in my career where I decided how things were going to go; I was willing to take the heat.\u201d Lane included the bonus track \u201cChampion\u201d as a small testament to that empowerment. \u201cIt makes a point,\u201d Lane says with a smile, \u201cThat I appreciate what you\u2019re saying, but get the fuck out of my way.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7177428.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Country, American as they come", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "11:00 AM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "575 Oakville Cross Rd, Napa, CA 94558", "Artist": "Troubadour77", "ArtistBio": "\u201cI guess we\u2019ll never know how the story could\u2019ve read, cause we can\u2019t go back again, to 1977,\u201d to quote a Troubadour 77 song lyric. Or can we? Nearly forty years later there is one band boldly leading the charge and taking fans back to the Rock n\u2019 Roll, California Country and Singer-Songwriter roots of the 1970s. Troubadour 77 has listened to the generation raised on great melodies, lyrics and records and agree with them that there is an under-served population of music lovers who are ripe to hear some new original music that can live beside the classics spinning in an endless loop on their favorite 70s satellite radio stations or streaming playlists. The time has come to deliver songs that address the life circumstances, social issues and perspectives of an older and wiser generation of music lovers, so make room on your playlist for Troubadour 77.\n\nTroubadour 77 (aka T77), is the brainchild of Grammy award-winning singer-songwriters, Anna Wilson (Piano) and Monty Powell (Electric Guitar). Not unlike the Buckingham Nicks alliance, Wilson and Powell have been married for 16 years, making music together as artists, songwriters and producers in Nashville. Collectively they have written a dozen #1 songs and countless album cuts that appear on over 70 million records and have co-produced unique special projects together that pay tribute to The Eagles, Billy Joel and the Countrypolitan era of music. Additionally, Powell was a key creative force in establishing the mega success story of Keith Urban. He was his early producer and one of Urban\u2019s top collaborators for many years, earning Golden Globe nominations and countless industry awards for the songs they composed together. Ultimately, Wilson and Powell spent 25 years in Music City together, but it wasn\u2019t until after breaking away and retreating to their second home in the Utah Mountains that they found a new muse that came calling so strong, they had to answer.\n\nThe songs of Troubadour 77 are written by Wilson and Powell and recorded with all the modern tools of today\u2019s industry in their world-class studio in Utah, but the result is an organic, non-mechanical sound, on purpose. Wilson began revisiting the records of Jackson Browne, The Eagles, Firefall, Linda Ronstadt and many others, and realized how much she missed someone just singing her a great song. Wilson states, \u201cIt was music that was authentic and addressed the issues of the times, and yet still holds up 40 years later cause it was honest and real. It\u2019s the type of music I\u2019ve always wanted to write and record as an artist but the industry would not allow it. Today, of course, we can take our music directly to the fans. I used to think I was just born 20 years too late because I wasn\u2019t in Los Angeles in 1975, I was only 5 years old singing in my room in Pennsylvania.\u201d Powell chimes in, \u201cWith all the new ways to discover music, you can make whatever record you want and then go find your true believers. We figured if we love that classic sound but don\u2019t just want to hear Stairway To Heaven for the ten- thousandth time, there\u2019s probably a whole lot of other folks out there who would love to hear some fresh tunes not dominated by kid singers, hip-hop based rhythms and soundscapes with cultural themes that just don\u2019t match who they are. Troubadour 77 is here to say it can be done and we are purposefully making new music with a classic sound.\u201d\n\nJoined by their band mates, Austin Weyand (Guitar), Kassi Weyand (Bass) and Nathan Chappell (Drums), the band hails from Salt Lake City. In an interesting twist, Austin and Kassi have been married for 15 years and making music together. Austin, originally from western Pennsylvania, is a premiere finger style guitar player who has recorded two solo albums and is the 2014 champion of the Wyoming finger style guitar competition, and also holds the same title in Utah from 2012. His wife Kassi, from Honeyville, UT, began playing the piano at a young age (5), and was very involved in theater and dance during her teenage and young adult years. After getting married she picked up the bass and began to perform with Austin and they forged a duo. Powell says, \u201cWhen we met Austin we knew he was something special. Then he told us his wife played bass and Anna and I said, bring her over and lets jam.\u201d Needless to say, Wilson & Powell were thrilled to have them join the band. Powell often jokes, \u201cYes, we are two married couples in a band together, like Fleetwood Mac, without the drugs and affairs.\u201d\n\nOn drums is Nathan Chappell, a Native American from the Hopi Tribe who grew up in Brigham City, Utah. He started playing drums at thirteen (1977) and later joined the Marine Corps at seventeen. He served for four years and went on to successfully work in the construction industry until deciding to take the leap and pursue his first love of music as a full time musician. He is a drum instructor for two private music schools, facilitates drum workshops for various after school and library arts programs and is a world-class cajone player, which is a skill all in itself.\n\nSo, who says you can\u2019t be forty, or even fifty-something, and start a rock band? Not Troubadour 77. Music, and making music, is not just for the young although you would be hard pressed to know that by what is regularly spit out by the music giants. In fact, instead of an explicit language sticker, T77 is, tongue firmly in cheek, labeling their music as \u201cnot suitable for anyone under the age of 35\u201d. Wilson says, \u201cIt\u2019s high time artists start making new music for adults as well as kids. Yes, dare I say songs you can understand the words to and that make you reflect and celebrate your place in life without relying entirely on the nostalgia of a bygone era. We\u2019re all getting older, I think artists should make music that addresses that part of the journey too.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time to wake up from the fog of your kid\u2019s music, to remember that every classic song was at one point brand new to you and everyone else in the world, and to rediscover that sense of wonder and connection when you heard someone singing TO you, FOR you, ABOUT you and in some mystical way, WITH you.

Kurt was born in 1980, one of ten children, and raised in the city of brotherly love, Philadelphia. As a teenager, his bluegrass-loving father gifted him with a banjo, when what Kurt craved was a guitar \u2013 so he played it as if it were.\n\n\n\nBewitched by lo-fi figureheads like Beck, Pavement, and Smog, along with a love for classics like Petty, Creedence, and Neil Young, he recorded his first songs and self-distributed them on CD-R between 2003 and 2007. These were compiled on 2008\u2019s Constant Hitmaker and the 2009 mini-album God Is Saying This To You... The dreamy and psychedelic tangles of damaged but still-lyrical songcraft announced a major new artist wandering in from the hinterlands.\n\n\n\nThe Violators (then featuring Adam Granduciel, with whom Vile had co-founded The War On Drugs) debuted on the 2009 EP The Hunchback, coming into their own on Childish Prodigy, Vile\u2019s third album and his first for Matador. More violent, more vivid, more ecstatically \u2018rock\u2019 than anything in Vile\u2019s catalogue, the album was a righteous leap forward. The album that followed, the breakthrough Smoke Ring For My Halo, was more reflective, something sun-dappled and sexy in softly strung-out strums like \u201cPeeping Tomboy,\u201d the kindred flipside to barnstormers like \u201cFreak Train\u201d off the previous record.\n\n\n\nHis fifth album, Wakin On A Pretty Daze, is a 69-minute double LP and Kurt\u2019s defining statement to date. Where previous albums alternated between gorgeous fingerpicking and heavy guitar workouts, this album blends the two in dreamy, expansive songs that gradually unfurl like a massive flag. It is a record that would have sounded great 30 years ago, sounds great today, and will still sound great 30 years from now.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8813691.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.46415, 37.77366], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Indie Folk, Indie Rock, Indie, Alternative", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Golden Gate Park"}, {"Address": "3038 Fulton St., San Francisco, CA 94118", "Artist": "The Pimps of Joytime", "ArtistBio": "Let\u2019s take it higher.\n\nAnyone familiar with the Pimps of Joytime live experience knows the feeling\u2014it\u2019s that moment when a deep bluesy groove morphs into a full-on EDM dance beat, or the sensation when the wide-eyed audience collectively elevates in sync with the band\u2019s tangible energy.\n\nOn Jukestone Paradise, the Pimps of Joytime raise the bar with swagger to spare, crafting ten cohesive songs that ring out like the soundtrack for a ride through the diverse Brooklyn neighborhood where their sound materialized. Pulling from lead guitarist and singer Brian J\u2019s deep discography of influences, the creation of Jukestone Paradise began a decade ago, when he penned anthems like \u201cSky\u201d and \u201cFreedom Dancer,\u201d all the way up to the album\u2019s studio recording sessions.\n\nYou might accurately call the Pimps of Joytime a \u2018post-genre\u2019 band; they\u2019re a group whose sound\u2014even within a single song\u2014mirrors the diversity of our era\u2019s musical tastes. \u201cIt\u2019s a sonic tapestry that\u2019s representative of this time and place that we live in,\u201d says Brian J.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Pimps excel, by mashing up \u201870s funk tones with modern dance beats, mixed with original samples creating their mosaic sound. For listeners weary of today\u2019s DJ culture but eager to dance with abandon, the Pimps of Joytime are the antidote.\n\n\u201cAt our core, the Pimps of Joytime are not just dance music,\u201d says Brian J of the band\u2019s three-part harmony attack. \u201cMy first vocal mentor was a doo-wop singer, so I have a long-time love affair with vocal harmonies.\u201d\n\nWith the release of Jukestone Paradise, the band makes official their solid touring lineup, featuring dual female vocalists and percussionists Mayteana Morales and Cole WilliamsX. And they\u2019re hitting the road hard, continuing a constant touring schedule that\u2019s already left prominent sets at festivals like Voodoo, Outside Lands, Bonnaroo and High Sierra in their wake.\n\nBehind the frontlines are bassist/keyboardist David Bailis and drummer John Staten, forming the rhythmic backbone of the Pimps\u2019 audible collage. And for Jukestone Paradise, they called in a few friends to lend their talents, including Ivan Neville, who lends New Orleans flavor to \u201cSky,\u201d and Rubblebucket\u2019s Alex Toth, who co-wrote the quirky and infectious \u201cDance Cardia.\u201d\n\nJust as Brooklyn has changed since the Pimps started, so has the band\u2019s sound. But as Williamsburg gentrifies, the Pimps of Joytime\u2019s diverse evolution keeps the neighborhood\u2019s spirit alive.

Fuck pandering. Fuck fakeness. Fuck fear.\u201d Fantastic Negrito is the incarnation of a musician who is reborn after going through a lot of awful shit. In fact, the name Fantastic Negrito represents his third rebirth, literally coming back from death this time. The narrative on this man is as important as the sound, because the narrative is the sound. Songs born from a long hard life channeled through black roots music. Slide guitar, drums, piano. Urgent, desperate, edgy. Fantastic Negrito is the story of a man who struggled to \u201cmake it\u201d, who \u201cgot it\u201d, and who lost it all. For anyone who ever felt like it was over yet hoped it wasn\u2019t, this is your music; blues harnessed, forged in realness. For anyone who ever considered getting their old high-school band back together, this is your inspiration. These are singular songs by a true musician who writes and produces. They are his fuel as he embarks on the third comeback of his life.\n\nThe first life (\u2018who am I and where am I going?\u2019). Fantastic Negrito was raised in an orthodox Muslim household. His father was a Somali-Caribbean immigrant who mostly played traditional African music. When, at the age of 12, Negrito\u2019s family moved from Massachusetts to Oakland, he was hit with an intense culture shock. Oakland in 1970s was a million miles from Negrito\u2019s conservative childhood. He went from Arab chants to Funkadelic in one day, living in the heart of one of the wildest, most infamous, most vibrant black communities in the nation. Shit was extra real in Oakland.\n\nBy the time he was 20, Negrito had taught himself to play every instrument he could get his hands on. He was recording music, but he was also caught up in street shit. This went on for several years until a near death encounter with masked gunmen. After that Negrito packed his bags and headed to LA, armed with a demo on cassette.\n\nThe second life (\u2018I want to be a star\u2026I think\u2019). It didn\u2019t take long for Negrito to find himself entrenched in the \u2018Hollywood\u2019 lifestyle; \u201cclubs and bitches and bullshit politics that have nothing to do with great music.\u201d Negrito signed with a big time manager and soon after that, a million dollar deal at Interscope \u2026and soon after that, creative death.\n\nThe record deal was a disaster. Gangsta rap was ruling the airwaves and Negrito was in the wrong place at the wrong era. Negrito came out of the deal with a failed album and his confidence gutted. He was infected by the constant emphasis on \u2018what would sell\u2019; which looks, hooks and gimmicks would attract an audience. He lost all sense of himself. The songs stopped coming to him, so he quit. He sold all of his shit and he quit.\n\nIn 2000, Negrito was in a near fatal car accident that put him in a coma. For four weeks it was touch and go. Because his muscles atrophied while bedridden, he had to go through months of frustrating physical therapy to regain use of his legs. Rods were placed throughout his body. And worst of all, his playing hand was mutilated. Though he rehabbed intensely for several years, the damage was permanent. In 2008, he returned home to Oakland.\n\nThe third life (the birth of Negrito). Back in Oakland, Negrito forgot about life as a musician. He got married, he planted vegetables, raised his own chickens, and made money growing weed. He also settled into being a man, on his own, clear of the distractions of wanting to be a star. This is when his specific POV of the world came into focus. His conservative Muslim values melded with the liberal, multi-cultural world of Oakland. The cynicism that comes from struggle made room for the hope that comes from cheating death. He truly knew who he was. He was confident about his place in the world because he understood it as much as any man can. And then his son Kyu was born.\n\nWith Kyu\u2019s entrance into the world, all the creative energy Negrito bottled for years came rushing. His musical choices were sharp and without doubt. He began recording without the hindrances that come with chasing trends. \u201cFuck what\u2019s hot now, what moves me?\u201d Negrito turned to the original DNA of all American music, the Blues. The beating life had given him primed him to channel his literal and musical forefathers: the Blues musicians of the Delta.\n\nFor Fantastic Negrito, \u201cderivative\u201d is the devil so to ensure his sound is his own, every chord comes from a place of immediacy. Immediacy opens the door for instinct. Instinct is God\u2019s tool that makes an artist into an individual. Negrito leaves the original sounds of Lead Belly and Skip Woods intact and builds bridges to modernity by looping and sampling his own live instruments.\n\nWhen you listen to Negrito, you\u2019re invited to hear the story of life after destruction. Your dream can die. You probably will give up. But from there, you can start everything over.\n\nFantastic Negrito EP out now\nhttp://blackballuniverse.bandcamp.com/album/fantasic-negrito-ep\nhttp://open.spotify.com/album/205ozCsqCFqgqFuT6zXzw6\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fantastic-negrito-ep/id968215538", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6827270.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Black Roots, Blues Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "2257 Larkspur Landing Cir, Larkspur, CA 94939", "Artist": "Brother Spellbinder", "ArtistBio": "Brother Spellbinder plays well-crafted songs with old world ache and modern angst.

The album takes us from the joys of childhood discovery to the depression and confusion of a quarter-life crisis to dancing your way toward the darkness at the end of days. In this collection of songs they push the boundaries of their harmony-driven grassroots origins to create their own distinctive Americana, integrating pop and bold rock flourishes along the way. Produced by Dan Cardinal (Josh Ritter, The Low Anthem, Darlingside), WE captures the band\u2019s maturing sound, having as much influence from 90\u2019s rock and 70\u2019s R&B as it does the indie folk material that fans have come to expect.\n\nThe band draws their name from the rural Maine town that's home to the Great North Sound Society, the farmhouse-turned-recording-studio of Josh Ritter keyboardist/producer Sam Kassirer. It was there that Parsonsfield cut their outstanding debut, Poor Old Shine (2013 Signature Sounds), which established them as a roots force to be reckoned with. Their rowdy live performances only upped the ante, with The Bluegrass Situation falling for their \"fun and frenzy\" and No Depression raving that they'll \"give you rich five-part harmonies one minute\u2026then rock you over the head with unbearably cool and raucous Celtic rhythms.\"\n\nThey once again called on Kassirer for their follow-up, Blooming Through The Black (2016 Signature Sounds), enlisting his engineering and production ingenuity to help convert an axe factory into a temporary recording studio.

Longtime members Paul Janeway (lead vocals), Jesse Phillips (bass, guitar), Browan Lollar (guitars), Andrew Lee (drums), Al Gamble (keyboards), and Allen Branstetter (trumpet) are joined by Jason Mingledorff (saxophone, clarinet, flute), and Chad Fisher (trombone).\n\nThe collection of new original songs is the group\u2019s first release on RECORDS, a joint venture of SONGS Publishing, winner of ASCAP\u2019s 2016 independent publisher of the year award, and veteran label executive Barry Weiss.\n\nSea of Noise is a successor to the Broken Bones\u2019 2013 debut album Half the City, which introduced the group\u2019s blazing mating of \u201860s soul fire \u2013 daubed with latter-day influences like Sly Stone, David Bowie, and Prince -- to Janeway\u2019s impassioned singing and writing. The new album witnesses a deepening and broadening of the unit\u2019s musical reach and lyrical concerns.\n\n\u201cIt felt like it happened organically,\u201d Janeway says of the band\u2019s development. \u201cWith the last record, it was like doing things with your hair on fire \u2013 going in, recording it live. There\u2019s a sense of urgency to having a record like that. We were only a band for about five months at that point. I didn\u2019t know my voice \u2013 I\u2019d never done this professionally. I was just learning more nuance, and about carrying a melody. You don\u2019t have to go for it 100% all the time. You can draw people in by giving and taking.\u201d\n\nJaneway says that he and his close musical associate Phillips began to ponder the direction of the band\u2019s second album a year and a half ago. \u201cIf we had been forced to go into a studio a year and a half ago, we probably would have done a better version of Half the City,\u201d he says. \u201cThere would have been nothing wrong with that. But we started evolving, or changing.\u201d\n\nWork began in earnest during last year\u2019s Coachella festival in California: \u201cWe rented a house in San Bernardino Valley National Park. The week in between the two weekends, we really started to hash things out. Then we rented out a very hot warehouse in Birmingham where we could write. And me and Jesse and a few of us would send stuff back and forth via Dropbox. That gave me the ability to work on harmonies on the vocals. I wanted to take it up a notch, in all realms.\u201d\n\nLooking to such inspirations as Tom Waits and Nick Cave, Janeway was intent on lifting his game as a songwriter on material for the second album. \u201cI\u2019m married to a woman with a masters in literature, and I can\u2019t show her lyrics unless I\u2019m pretty proud of \u2018em,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to sit and think about what I\u2019m saying \u2013 what do I want to say, is there anything to say? What\u2019s my perspective as this Southern kid who\u2019s watching the modern world and feeling very much like an alien in a lot of ways. This is more personal. If you\u2019re going to say something, say something, and don\u2019t waste your breath unless you feel like you\u2019re saying something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nJaneway adds that his reading of the book Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, played a role in the direction of the work: \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be an overly political record, but I feel it shows up a little bit on the album.\u201d\n\nWith a full complement of new songs in hand, St. Paul and the Broken Bones entered the studio with Butler, leader of the British band the Bees and producer of Devendra Banhart and Michael Kiwanuka.\n\n\u201cJesse was listening to one of his records and he said, \u2018Everything sounds great,\u2019\u201d Janeway recalls. \u201cIt sounded like a real record \u2013 everything had depth, and was expansive-sounding. Butler ended up being the guy that we wanted to use. Producer-wise, I think we knocked a home run. He is very meticulous.\u201d\n\nOn Sea of Noise, the band\u2019s brawny horn-driven sound is augmented \u2013 and displaced -- by the use of a string quartet and a vocal choir. The strings \u2013 recorded at Memphis\u2019 historic Sam Phillips Recording by engineer Jeff Powell \u2013 were arranged by Lester Snell, a veteran of Stax Records sessions by Isaac Hayes, Shirley Brown, Albert King, and the Staple Singers, among many others. Janeway says of Snell, \u201cHe did all these classic, great records in Memphis \u2013 he did the string arrangements on them. The strings, for us, supply a darker tone. Horns sometimes can\u2019t portray a certain darkness. We thought that would be the best option, instead of horn lines. We have songs on this record that don\u2019t have any horns at all.\u201d\n\nEmployed on \u201cCrumbling Light Posts,\u201d the recurring motif that appears three times on the album, Jason Clark and the Tennessee Mass Choir were recorded in another legendary Memphis facility. \u201cThe Stax Museum let us go in there after hours and record the choir,\u201d Janeway says, adding with a laugh. \u201cWe said, \u2018Well, hell, we\u2019re in Memphis, let\u2019s just see if they\u2019ll do it.\u2019 It was pretty neat, I\u2019m not gonna lie.\u201d\n\nHe says of the finished work, \u201cSea of Noise is not quite a full-blown concept record. It is focused in terms of subject matter \u2013 finding redemption and salvation and hope. \u2018Crumbling Light Posts\u2019 comes from an old Winston Churchill quote, in which he said England was a crumbling lighthouse in a sea of darkness. I always thought that was a really interesting concept \u2013 that we\u2019re falling anyway. In this day and age, it is the noise that has defined so many things. We\u2019re going to fall to it eventually, but for now we feel like our heads are above water. It felt anthemic.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s lyrical and emotional richness is heard loudly in stunning new compositions like \u201cBurning Rome\u201d (which Janeway describes as \u201ca letter to God, if I could write it\u201d) and the startling \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Woman,\u201d which knocks traditional soul music gender roles on their heads. Janeway says of the latter song, \u201cI wrote that with Jesse, and he said, \u2018If I can write that song, I can die a happy man, because I\u2019ve finally made something that I feel can stand up to my standards.\u2019\u201d\n\nSt. Paul and the Broken Bones, which toured extensively in the U.S. and Europe behind their debut album, will put their take-no-prisoners live show on the road this fall. Their most recent concert work included arena dates opening for the Rolling Stones in Atlanta and Buffalo. Some acts may have been daunted by such a task, but not this one.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty neat, it was pretty crazy,\u201d Janeway says. \u201cI love the Rolling Stones, but my train of thought it, you gotta try and blow \u2018em off the stage. And that\u2019s still my goal.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8757676.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Soul, R&B, Rock n Roll", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "San Francisco, CA", "Artist": "The Infamous Stringdusters", "ArtistBio": "The Infamous Stringdusters rise to new heights on their ninth full-length record Rise Sun. For the album, the GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning quintet\u2014Andy Falco [guitar], Chris Pandolfi [banjo], Andy Hall [dobro], Jeremy Garrett [fiddle], and Travis Book [double bass]\u2014expanded their signature sound by perfecting their seamless fusion of All-American-bluegrass and rock.\n\nOnce again sail into uncharted territory moored only by their expressive patchwork of All-American bluegrass threaded together with strands of rock, jazz, funk, country, old-time, and more.\nAs they approached this latest body of work, the group\u2019s ambition matched their outsized creative curiosity.\n\n\u201cRise Sun was sparked by the feeling of wanting something better for the world\u2014more love, more awareness, and more compassion,\u201d says Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s a message of taking care of each other, our planet, and our selves. We all shared this feeling as evidenced by the songs we brought to the project. It\u2019s the feeling of a rising sun as opposed to a dark night. Sometimes a message of hope is less popular than one of despair, but it\u2019s much-needed nevertheless.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a message that 13 years, eight studio projects, and nearly 1,000 shows prepared the boys to properly present. The Infamous Stringdusters stand out as the rare group who can team up with Ryan Adams on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert one night and headline the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre or perform alongside The Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh the next. Engendering a sense of impassioned fandom, they band have attracted a faithful audience that continues to grow. Moreover, their powerful music and performances paved the way for a GRAMMY\u00ae Award win in the category of \u201cBest Bluegrass Album\u201d for 2017\u2019s Laws of Gravity.\n\nWhen it came time to record what would become Rise Sun, they pushed themselves to evolve once more.\n\n\u201cRise Sun is the latest chapter in the progression of our sound,\u201d says Pandolfi. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long arc that includes evolution on all fronts\u2014writing, arranging, performing, and maybe most importantly, growing as humans who have more to say as the journey rolls on. New albums are the time when we write and introduce our strongest original material. On our last release Laws of Gravity, we really started to hit our stride with recording live in the studio. Rise Sun is another big step in that direction.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, the band chose the song order before actually recording. Additionally, they maintained that order throughout the process, recording the songs in sequence which resulted in a natural flow. This choice, \u201cgives it the feeling of a story as you listen down,\u201d says Hall. It represented a moment of collective confidence.\n\n\u201cWe self-produced the last album, so we felt validated in a sense that our instincts were sound,\u201d adds Book. \u201cWe came into this one with some confidence. Any doubts about our band or our mission had dissipated. What remained was a deep sense of purpose and love.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe GRAMMY\u00ae put some high-octane gas in our tanks as well,\u201d grins Garrett. \u201cWe also wanted to rise to the challenge of making a follow-up project worthy of what we had done in the past.\u201d\nThe Infamous Stringdusters introduce the album with the handclap-driven gallop of the title track \u201cRise Sun.\u201d High energy banjo powers an uplifting and undeniable refrain that immediately shines.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hopeful anthem,\u201d Book elaborates. \u201cThe sun is rising, and the light is overtaking the darkness. The idea for the melody, inspired by Southern gospel music, came to me driving out of the mountains into Georgia from my home in North Carolina. When we wrote it, I was feeling a deep sense of hope for humanity that the sun will rise again.\u201d\n\nThen, there\u2019s the hummable instrumental \u201cCloud Valley,\u201d which exudes a sci-fi spirit of wonder via sonic intricacy. \u201cScience fiction can transport you to a place of deep imagination,\u201d says Pandolfi. \u201cWe wanted to generate a soundscape for an imaginary mystical setting. It really came alive when we all got together.\u201d\n\nEverything culminates on a heartfelt send-off with \u201cTruth and Love.\u201d Its delicate musical backdrop transmits an important statement for The Infamous Stringdusters.\n\n\u201cI wrote that a few years ago and brought it back now, because I feel like the message has become more relevant today,\u201d Falco states. \u201cThe world is polarized. Everything is so extreme, and partisan politics have become a culture war. The song is a reminder of what\u2019s truly important in life\u2014seek the truth, find your love, look up high, and aim above. Life is short, so keep your eye on what\u2019s important while you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nIn the end, that\u2019s precisely what The Infamous Stringdusters do on Rise Sun as they boldly welcome yet another new day, new phase, and new chapter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a brotherhood, but that family extends beyond the band even,\u201d Falco leaves off. \u201cOur music gives us an opportunity to bring some light in a world that can be dark sometimes.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8979652.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Bluegrass, Folk, Americana, Jam Bands", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "880 John F Kennedy Dr, San Francisco, CA 94121", "Artist": "The Wild Reeds", "ArtistBio": "www.thewildreedsmusic.com", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8883895.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4933247, 37.7698278], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Folk", "OtherInfo": "FREE EVENT (NO TICKETS NEEDED)\nhttp://www.hardlystrictlybluegrass.com/2019/artists", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "West Hellman Hollow"}, {"Address": "175 FAIRGROUNDS DR., Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Adriel Favela", "ArtistBio": "www.thewildreedsmusic.com", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7924747.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.62899, 38.240934], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Latin", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "TERRENOS DE LA FERIA PETALUMA"}, {"Address": "1777 Yosemite #330, San Francisco, CA 94124", "Artist": "The Other World", "ArtistBio": "The Other World is a Progressive Rock band from Enschede, the Netherlands.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6368688.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.394972, 37.72825], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Progressive Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "Zaccho Dance Theatre"}, {"Address": "175 FAIRGROUNDS DR., Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Los Parras", "ArtistBio": "INFO@LARRECORDS.COM\n\nSaludos a todos bienbenidos a nuestra pagina oficial!!\nContrataciones con Jorge al +1(559)9061332\nY Arre Con la R Records", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9021620.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.62899, 38.240934], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Norte\u00f1o, Banda, Mexican Traditions, Regional Music", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "TERRENOS DE LA FERIA PETALUMA"}, {"Address": "175 FAIRGROUNDS DR., Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Kanales", "ArtistBio": "INFO@LARRECORDS.COM\n\nSaludos a todos bienbenidos a nuestra pagina oficial!!\nContrataciones con Jorge al +1(559)9061332\nY Arre Con la R Records", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.62899, 38.240934], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "TERRENOS DE LA FERIA PETALUMA"}, {"Address": "5565 Tesla Rd, Livermore, CA 94550", "Artist": "Sunny And The Black Pack", "ArtistBio": "Since 2015, Sunny And The Black Pack have been building a reputation as true visionaries in the music scene.

His dad ran a radio station in southern California and brought home all the promo LPs that didn't fit the Spanish-language format. The Ventures' Guitar Freakout, The 50 Guitars of Tommy Garrett and Alvin And The Chipmunks Play The Beatles' Hits all came home on a single fateful day.\n\n\n\nIt didn't hurt, either, that string-meister David Lindley played in a bluegrass band that rehearsed right next door and gave Stevie his very first lessons, or that his dear Granny was a pianist in the heyday of vaudeville and that his sainted mother was a whiz in mandolin orchestras during the 1930s.\n\n\n\nNot even several years of playing Folk Masses every Sunday could quash his musical spirit, and in high school he began fingerpicking, inspired - as so many were - by that first Hot Tuna album.\n\n\n\nAfter securing degrees in Theatre and Theology at Santa Clara University he hit the road for 3 years with The Royal Lichtenstein Circus. Once back home, he signed on as actor and stage manager for The San Jose Repertory Company. He announced killer whale shows. His best friend was an elephant.\n\n\n\nHe and his good pal Roy Zimmerman have worked closely in several collaborations over the past 25 years, including folk tribute / parody band The Foremen and comedy duo The Reagan Bros. in Los Angeles, and while there, Stevie appeared on Cheers and in many television commercials and had a regular role on The Young And The Restless (which was utterly subsumed by then-daily broadcasts of the interminable Iran-Contra hearings.)\n\n\n\nSafely back in the Bay Area, he continued his acting career, doing commercials, radio, voiceovers and films and played in folk duos The Frontmen and The Back Room Boys. In 1999 he co-founded and fronted The Waybacks and toured steadily with them from 2001 through 2007. The band released 4 albums in that time, played major festivals like Merlefest, Grey Fox, Floydfest, Great Waters, Old Settlers, Bumbershoot and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, toured Australia and collaborated with Lloyd Maines, Michelle Shocked and Bob Weir of The Grateful Dead.\n\n\n\nStevie's gone solo now, and is busily booking festivals, venues and house concerts.

Drawing from a diverse well of influences which include classical, jazz, Motown, swing, funk, and world music among others, Carter was born in Detroit and began studying piano at age two before taking up the violin. Her earliest training was in classical music, but an interest in jazz eventually took over. In 1987, she joined the all-female pop-jazz quintet Straight Ahead and appeared on their first three albums before leaving the band in 1991 and moving to New York, where she picked up session work with artists including Aretha Franklin, Lauryn Hill, Mary J. Blige, Billy Joel, Dolly Parton, Max Roach and Oliver Lake. She released her self-titled solo album on Atlantic in 1995, followed by Something for Grace, an album dedicated to her mother and released in 1997. Carter also toured with Wynton Marsalis that same year, then switched to the Verve label where she released Rhythms of the Heart in 1999. Motor City Moments, a tribute to her hometown, followed in 2000. In December 2001, she traveled to Genoa, Italy, and made musical history by being the first jazz musician and the first African American to play the legendary Guarneri Del Gesu violin, made in 1743 and owned by classical music virtuoso and composer Niccolo Paganini. This encounter inspired her 2003 album, Paganini: After a Dream, which featured works by Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy and Italian film composer Ennio Morricone. She recorded I\u2019ll Be Seeing You: A Sentimental Journey in 2006 as a tribute to her late mother. That same year Carter was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship, given to a highly select group who \u201cshow exceptional merit and promise for continued and enhanced creative work.\u201d Reverse Thread, released in May 2010, was a celebration of traditional African music via a contemporary perspective. Carter also took her pioneering spirit on the road in the late summer and fall of 2012 for a two-month world tour with rock icon Joe Jackson\u2019s stellar ensemble in support of his release The Duke, a collection of interpretations of Duke Ellington\u2019s work. Carter continues her musical quest for beauty and history with her SONY Music Masterworks debut Southern Comfort, in which she investigates her family history and explores the folk tunes her paternal grandfather, a coalminer, would have heard as he toiled in Alabama. The expanded project includes a blend of folk songs and spirituals, serving as Carter\u2019s interpretation of her roots through a modern lens. Said Chuck Mitchell, Senior Vice President of SONY Masterworks, \"We're tremendously pleased to have the incomparable Regina Carter with us at Masterworks.

Now, that is something very difficult to achieve.\u201d\n\nDionisio Jes\u00fas \"Chucho\" Vald\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, was born in a family of musicians in Quivic\u00e1n, Havana province, Cuba, October 9, 1941. His first teachers were his father, the pianist, composer and bandleader Ram\u00f3n \u201cBebo\u201d Vald\u00e9s, and his mother Pilar Rodr\u00edguez, who sang and played the piano.\n\nAt the age of three, Chucho already played at the piano, using both hands, in any key, melodies he heard on the radio. In fact, there is a famous anecdote that tells the story of Bebo tricking his friend, the late Israel \u201cCachao\u201d Lopez, about checking out, with his back to the player, \u201ca young North American pianist.\u201d Chucho was then four years old.\n\nAt the age of five, Chucho began to take lessons on piano, theory and solfege with maestro Oscar Mu\u00f1oz Boufartique. He continued his studies at the Conservatorio Municipal de M\u00fasica de la Habana, from which he graduated at 14. Chucho also took private lessons from Zenaida Romeu, Rosario Franco, Federico Smith and Leo Brouwer.\n\n\u201cAt home he played jazz: the music of Ellington, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller\u2019s band. I\u2019ve been privileged. Because Bebo was the piano player at the Tropicana I could see true legend of jazz in person. He took me to see Nat King Cole, Errol Garner and Sarah Vaughan when I was child studying music. You can\u2019t imagine the effect that had on my life! It was enormous! Magical!\nAt 15 Chucho formed his first jazz trio end in December 1958 he worked as a pianist at the Deauville and St. John hotels in Havana. In 1959, he debuted with the orchestra Sabor de Cuba, directed by his father, Bebo. That band accompanied the top singers of that era such as Rolando Laserie, Fernando \u00c1lvarez and P\u00edo Leyva.\n\n\u201cMy father taught me everything about Cuban music, South American music, jazz, and how to work with an orchestra,\u201d reminisces Chucho. \u201c He gave me the piano chair, and stayed on as director, so I could learn how to work under a conductor. We did our shows and a million other things with that orchestra, including accompanying shows at the Havana Hilton. I learned a lot there. He is my idol, \u201che pauses, then continues. \u201cI don\u00b4t say was, my idol. He is my idol. He was my teacher. He still is.\u201d\n\nChucho\u2019s family and professional life took a dramatic turn in 1960 when his father left to work in Mexico and from there he moved to Europe, where he eventually settled. Bebo Vald\u00e9s never returned to Cuba. (Father and son saw each other again 18 years later at Carnegie Hall, where Chucho was debuting in the United States with his group Irakere. The relationship was fully restored in 2000, when they met again to play a duet on Calle 54, a film about Latin jazz by Oscar winning Spanish director Fernando Trueba. The father and son reunion culminated, musically, in Juntos Para Siempre, a 2007 duet recording that won both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy. Bebo Vald\u00e9s died on March 22, 2013. He was 94.)\n\nIn the early \u201860s, Chucho worked as a pianist at the Teatro Mart\u00ed (1961), the Sal\u00f3n Internacional del Hotel Habana Riviera (1963) and the orchestra of the Teatro Musical de la Habana (1964-67). In 1967, and after a suggestion of his old teacher, the great guitarist, composer and director Leo Brouwer, Chucho organized his own combo.\n\nStill, that same year he joins the important Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, then directed by maestros Armando Romeu and Rafael Somavilla. While a member of the orchestra, Chucho revisited the idea of a small group and, in 1970, he appeared at the Jazz Jamboree in Poland leading his own quintet.\n\nIn 1972, after recording Jazz Bat\u00e1, an album featuring an unusual jazz trio comprising bassist Carlos del Puerto and singer and percussionist Oscar Vald\u00e9s on bat\u00e1 (the traditional hourglass shaped drums used in the ritual music of the Orishas), Chucho decided to enlarge the group adding brass and trap drums. That\u00b4s the genesis, in 1973, of Irakere, a small, Cuban-style big band that played an explosive mix of jazz, rock, classical music and traditional Cuban music, including Afro-Cuban religious music and instruments.\n\n\u201cThe ideas for the brass have to do with the work we did with the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, which was a great big band,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cI tried to imitate that with four horns -- two trumpets, a alto and a tenor sax -- and with just that try to have the sound of a big band. Of course when you have monster players like Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, [trumpeter] Jorge Varona and [saxophonist] Carlos Averhoff you can write anything you want and it will work.\u201d\nIrakere first made its mark internationally in Finland in 1976. But the following year, the band was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie in a visit to Havana on a jazz cruise that also included pianist Earl \u201cFatha\u201d Hines and saxophonist Stan Getz. In 1978 the producer Bruce Lundvall, then president of CBS, signed the band for the label. Irakere debuted, unannounced, as \u201csurprise guests,\u201d at Carnegie Hall as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. As fate would have it, the program that night also featured pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, two of Chucho\u2019s main influences.\n\nSelections from Irakere\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival comprised the repertory of Irakere (CBS) their debut recording in the United States. The album won a Grammy as Best Latin Recording in 1979.\n\nThe group went on to create an extraordinary body of work that includes great dance recordings such as Homenaje a Beny Mor\u00e9 (Pimienta, 1989) and Indestructible (Sony, 1997); explorations of Afro-Cuban religious music such as Babal\u00fa Ay\u00e9 (Bemb\u00e9, 1999) featuring the great Orisha music singer L\u00e1zaro Ros; as well as ambitious projects such as Tierra En Trance (Are\u00edto, 1983) and Misa Negra (Messidor, 1987)\n\nIrakere\u2019s lineup went through many changes over the years. Throughout, Chucho remained as the one, great constant. But success had its costs. Except for the remarkable solo outing Lucama (Mission, 1986), his talent as a pianist was largely out of sight, obscured by his other obligations with the band.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1997, Chucho won his second Grammy for his work on Habana (Verve) as a member of trumpeter Roy Hargrove\u2019s Crisol. The following year, while not completely leaving Irakere behind, Chucho started a parallel career as a solo player and quartet leader, looking for greater opportunities to explore and showcase his playing.\n\n\u201cTwenty five years with the same band is a long time,\u201d said Chucho at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to play solo and with a quartet for some time now. My work as a pianist and soloist gets diluted in Irakere. My job in the group is to be the composer, arranger and musical director and that\u2019s a completely different role.\u201d\n\nChucho stayed with Irakere until 2005.\n\nThe fruitful period that followed is highlighted by albums such as Solo Piano (Blue Note, 1991), Solo: Live in New York (Blue Note, 2001) and New Conceptions (Blue Note, 2003), as well as quartet recordings such as Bele Bele en La Habana (Blue Note, 1998), Briyumba Palo Congo (Blue Note, 1999) and Live at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note, 2000), capturing a performance that features Chucho\u2019s sister, singer Mayra Caridad Vald\u00e9s . The recording won a Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album.\n\nThere were also Grammy awards for the already mentioned Juntos Para Siempre (Calle 54, 2007), the duet recording with Bebo; and for Chucho\u2019s Steps (Comanche, 2010), featuring his new group, the Afro-Cuban Messengers .\n\nIn total, Chucho has won five Grammys and three Latin Grammys.\n\nIn 2012, Chucho reorganized his Afro-Cuban Messengers which currently feature Yaroldy Abreu, percussion, Dreiser Durruthy Bombal\u00e9 , bat\u00e1 drums and voice; Reinaldo Meli\u00e1n, trumpet, Gast\u00f3n Joya, bass and Rodney Barreto, drums.\n\nHis most recent production, Border-Free, is yet another expression of the continuing musical search and evolution of Chucho Vald\u00e9s as a pianist, composer, arranger and director.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9040181.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Latin-Jazz", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "SFJAZZ Center - Miner Auditorium"}, {"Address": "201 Franklin St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Chucho Valdes", "ArtistBio": "Chucho Vald\u00e9s\nBio\n\n\nWinner of five GRAMMY\u00ae and three Latin GRAMMY\u00ae Awards, the Cuban pianist, composer and arranger Chucho Vald\u00e9s is the most influential figure in modern Afro-Cuban jazz.\n\nHis most recent work, Border-Free, features eight pieces -- all but one new originals -- and it\u2019s another example of Vald\u00e9s\u2019 musical pursuit, one in which the conventional limits of styles and traditions blur and disappear.

In that time, they've written music, recorded albums, and performed at some of the most notable festivals and venues across the country.\n\nIn the often tightly defined genre of bluegrass music, Wood & Wire's ethos is not unheard of. Nor are the elements of song crafting, so often associated with their Texas home, that permeate their sound. That said, what comes out of the Wood & Wire blender is something entirely its own. Tony Kamel -- lead singer, guitarist, mover, shaker, and primary songwriter -- brings his material to the group in a malleable form, and the results are illimitable. \"I think I'm most proud of how we've developed our sound together,\" says Kamel. \"It feels great to step on stage feeling like we've really found our own style.\"\n\n\n\nA culmination of very distinct musical personalities, there's one ambition they all share: \"Our goal is to show up and drive, so that the energy hits you, and it's undeniable,\" says bassist Dom Fisher.\n\n\n\nFisher, a New York state native, formed the group with Kamel in 2011. Shortly thereafter, the addition of banjoist Trevor Smith, says Fisher, \"really put us on a different level.\"\n\n\n\nSmith, who had been playing music with Fisher, Kamel and other local musicians at a weekly bluegrass gig in Austin, actually grew up playing classical piano. After attending his first bluegrass festival, he picked up his main instrument, the banjo. \"I was perplexed by the sound of it, and I had to figure it out,\" says Smith. \"We're rooted in traditional bluegrass but don't limit ourselves to any perceived notion of what that's supposed to be. We do our own thing, and we realize that vision collectively.\"\n\n\n\nMandolinist Billy Bright joined the group in 2014. Bright brought with him a suitcase full of tunes and a trunk full of ideas.\"Billy really rounded us out in a big way\" says Fisher. \"We're really excited to finally make a studio record with him.\"\n\n\n\nThe band will begin doing just that in the fall of 2016, along with continuing to explore the next installment of its one mic-style Woodshed Sessions, on which the band intends to draw heavily from the book of John Hartford.\n\n\n\n\"We're fortunate to have reached both die-hard bluegrass fans, folks who have never heard of bluegrass, and everything in between,\" says Kamel. \"We'll keep working hard to bring the music to our fans.\"", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/554026.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.4112145, 37.794689500000004], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Bluegrass, Singer Songwriters", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival "}, {"Address": "11180 CA-1, Point Reyes Station, CA 94956", "Artist": "Rainy Eyes", "ArtistBio": "Irena Eide is a Northern California folk, rock and Americana singer/songwriter.\n\n\n\nIrena was born and raised in Bergen, Norway, and she has been living, writing, playing and performing in the Bay Area and throughout the US since 2006.\n\nHer songs carry elements of folk, bluegrass, Americana, rock, country and soul, and draws on inspiration from artists and bands such as Bob Dylan, Town Van Zandt, Lucinda Williams, Johnny Cash, Neil Young, Gillian Welch, The Band, and many more.\n\n\n\nShe won \"best song of the month\" at the Freight and Salvage West Coast Songwriters competition in April 2015 for her song \"Moon In The Mirror\", and has co-written two songs with grammy-award winning Peter Rowan.

After an extensive touring career of over 20 years with luminaries like Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Al Jarreau, Stan Getz, David Sanborn, Joe Sample, Cassandra Wilson, Clark Terry, Dianne Reeves and more, she returned to her hometown where she was appointed professor at her alma mater, Berklee College of Music. Terri Lyne also received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music in 2003.\n\nAfter studying under full scholarship at Berklee, with the encouragement of her mentor, Jack DeJohnette, Carrington moved to New York in 1983. For 5 years she was a much in-demand musician, working with James Moody, Lester Bowie, Pharoah Sanders, and others. In the late \u201880s she relocated to Los Angeles, where she gained recognition on late night TV as the house drummer for the Arsenio Hall Show, then again in the late \u201890s as the drummer on the Quincy Jones late night TV show, VIBE, hosted by Sinbad.\n\nIn 1989, Carrington released a GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated debut CD on Verve entitled Real Life Story, which featured Carlos Santana, Grover Washington Jr., Wayne Shorter, Patrice Rushen, Gerald Albright, John Scofield, Greg Osby, and Hiram Bullock. Other solo CDs include 2002\u2019s Jazz is a Spirit, which features Herbie Hancock, Gary Thomas, Wallace Roney, Terence Blanchard, Kevin Eubanks, and Bob Hurst, and 2004\u2019s Structure, a cooperative group which features Adam Rogers, Jimmy Haslip and Greg Osby. Both CDs were released on the Europe-based ACT Music label and enjoyed considerable media attention and critical acclaim in the European and Japanese markets.\n\nCarrington\u2019s production and songwriting collaborations with artists such as Gino Vannelli, Peabo Bryson, Dianne Reeves, Siedah Garrett, Marilyn Scott have produced notable works as well, including her production of the Dianne Reeves GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated CD, That Day, as well as Dianne Reeves GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning CD, Beautiful Life, in 2014.\n\nCarrington has performed on many recordings throughout the \u201880s and \u201890s thru today. Notable examples of her work include Herbie Hancock\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning CD Gershwin\u2019s World, where she played alongside Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder. She has toured in many of Hancock\u2019s musical configurations (from electric to acoustic) and is featured on his Future2Future DVD.\n\nAfter a hiatus from the U.S. recording scene as a solo recording artist, Carrington returned in 2008 with More To Say... (Real Life Story: NextGen). Joining her was an impressive all-star cast of jazz and contemporary jazz instrumentalists, including George Duke, Everette Harp, Kirk Whalum, Jimmy Haslip, Greg Phillinganes, Gregoire Maret, Christian McBride, Danilo Perez, Patrice Rushen, Robert Irving III (who also serves as co-producer), Chuck Loeb, Dwight Sills, and legendary vocalists Les McCann and Nancy Wilson.\n\nCarrington released The Mosaic Project in 2011, her fifth recording overall and first on Concord Jazz. The critically acclaimed CD, which won a GRAMMY\u00ae Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album, gathered a myriad of voices and crystallized them into a multi-faceted whole that far outweighed the sum of its parts. She produced the 14-song set which included some of the most prominent female jazz artists of the last few decades: Esperanza Spalding, Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Sheila E., Nona Hendryx, Cassandra Wilson, Geri Allen and several others. Carrington said the emergence of so many great female jazz instrumentalists over the last couple of decades is what made an album like The Mosaic Project possible.\n\nIn 2013, Carrington released Money Jungle: Provocative in Blue, her much anticipated homage to Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Max Roach, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of their iconic 1963 Money Jungle album. The recording featured Gerald Clayton and Christian McBride, with guests Clark Terry, Lizz Wright, Herbie Hancock and others. Carrington made history when she became the first woman to win a GRAMMY\u00ae Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, Carrington releases The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL. Like its predecessor, the album presents Carrington leading a rotating cast of superb female instrumentalists and vocalists that includes Oleta Adams, Natalie Cole, Paula Cole, Lalah Hathaway, Chaka Khan, Chant\u00e9 Moore, Valerie Simpson, Nancy Wilson, Jaguar Wright and Lizz Wright, as well as saxophonist Tia Fuller, trumpeter Ingrid Jensen; bassists Meshell Ndegoecello and Linda Oh; and keyboardists Geri Allen, Patrice Rushen and Rachel Z.\n\nOn The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL, Carrington juxtaposes her salute to female artists by paying homage to various male artists who have either influenced her professionally and/or informed her musicality, such as Nick Ashford, George Duke, Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Luther Vandross and Bill Withers. \u201cWhenever I do something that celebrates women, I never want it to feel like it\u2019s something that excludes men,\u201d she explains. \u201cOn this record, I consciously wanted to celebrate the various relationships women have with men either through original songs of mine or cover songs by male composers and song writers.\u201d The male presence and perspective on The Mosaic Project: LOVE and SOUL is even more realized by Billy Dee Williams, who contributes insightful spoken-word interludes through the disc.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9034481.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42155, 37.77637], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "OtherInfo": "Kris Davis performs with her groundbreaking trio Diatom Ribbons including influential GRAMMY-winning drummer Terri Lyne Carrington and Haitian DJ, sound sculptor and percussionist Val Jeanty.", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "SFJazz Center"}, {"Address": "1 Castro St, Forest Knolls, CA 94933", "Artist": "Junk Parlor", "ArtistBio": "JUNK PARLOR Biography A galvanizing force on the Bay Area indie rock scene since launching serendipitously in 2013, Junk Parlor is that crazy-rare band whose vibe is so driven by joyful schizophrenia that it transcends easy genre trappings. Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8142032.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.689102, 38.014869], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Junk, Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Papermill Creek Saloon"}, {"Address": "201 Washington St, Petaluma, CA 94952", "Artist": "Mark Daly", "ArtistBio": "Acclaimed Hard Rock singer/songwriter - MARK DALY - is thrilled to unveil his debut solo album: \u2018When the Stars Align\u2019.\n\nBreaking from his masterful work with US supergroup Operation:Mindcrime, \u2018Addicted To The Throne\u2019 was the first taster of Daly\u2019s debut solo album: \u2018When The Stars Align\u2019, released on 7th September 2018.\n\nCalling to mind the work of late greats Chris Cornell or Jeff Buckley, \u2018Addicted To The Throne\u2019 is a haunting lullaby barbed with brittle feedback and awash with a spine-chilling production; the single marks the opening of a darker, more mature songwriting chapter in Daly\u2019s career. Speaking about the inspiration for the track and its accompanying video, Mark Daly says:\n\n\u201c[Addicted to the Throne] was inspired by the obsession of power and ego in today\u2019s world and how addictive it can be and how hard it is to break away from. The music video highlights the effects of bullying and just how dangerous it can be and also shows the viewpoint from the bully\u2019s perspective as to where it originally stems from. It has a powerful ending which shows that the bully was too late to make up for her mistake as the girl she had bullied has ended her life. Filmed in Cork City, the video was shot by EPIC productions and directed by Chris Cullen. Written and recorded by Daly between his home in Cork, Ireland and Seattle, Washington, \u2018Addicted to the Throne\u2019 was mixed and produced at Ogar Shack Studios Seattle by Kelly Gray (Queensryche, Candlebox, Operation:MindCrime), who also produces all of the material set that features on Daly\u2019s debut solo album. Watch here: Official Music Video 'Addicted to the Throne'\n\nMark has recently released his highly anticipated second single \u2018Bad Soul\u2019 from his debut album along with a powerful music video that captures the power of regret and sorrow in life.\n\nHailing from Cork in Ireland, Mark Daly, is a powerful singer/songwriter with hard rock pedigree in abundance. In a career that has seen him rub shoulders with some of the best, Daly is perhaps best known for his role in US supergroup: Operation:Mindcrime. The group, which is led by vocalist Geoff Tate (formerly of Queensryche) who has sold over 25 million records, secured a Grammy nomination, and toured the world many times over, also included in their ranks are musicians from bands Disturbed, Ozzy Osbourne, Whitesnake and AC/DC.\n\nAt the beginning of Mark\u2019s career he formed and fronted critically acclaimed rock group, The Voodoos in 2010, the band were invited to perform at the 2011 MTV EMAs and amassed fans in their many thousands during their chaotic tour of the US in 2012/13.\n\nHowever, it is only in more recent years that Daly has truly begun to forge his blossoming solo career. Releasing his first solo single \u2018The Hearts Reminder\u2019 to a rapturous reception in 2016, the single was an instant hit and stacked up over 50,000 views on Facebook in its first week alone, not to mention landing an impressive Number 2 chart position in the Irish Rock downloads chart.\n\nThe track was followed by a charity single for Autism Awareness month called \u2018Your World\u2019 in April 2017 and received global airplay and similarly impressive video views to its predecessor (60,000) and shooting straight to Number 1 in the Global Scottish New Music Chart.\n\n\u2018When The Stars Align\u2019 was released in September 2018, Daly\u2019s album may have been a long time coming but it has been worth the wait.\n\nAfter completing a successful UK & Ireland tour in December 2018. Plans are now well underway for tours across Europe and the US in 2019.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION: www.markdalyofficial.com https://www.facebook.com/markdalymusic www.twitter.com/markdalymusic Email: markdalymusic@gmail.com", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8997071.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.643119, 38.23494], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Rock", "OtherInfo": "Mark Daly & Band will tour America supporting Geoff Tate's Operation: Mindcrime in September and October of 2019.

The album is both his most personal statement yet and a summation of his career thus far. Robert Ellis opens with \u201cPerfect Strangers,\u201d a meditation on what brings people together (and how tenuous that connection can be), and ends with \u201cIt's Not OK,\u201d a raw look at emotional compromise. Between those two powerful bookends are nine other songs that set Ellis's soaring vocals and knowing melodies against his sharp, dark observations, and that show him in full command of a vibrant set of songwriting skills\u2014irony, distance, character, narrative, a thoughtful relationship between sound and sense.\n\n\n\nEllis was born and raised in Lake Jackson, a town about an hour from Houston whose other famous residents have included the Pauls (Ron and Rand) and Selena (the original Queen of Tejano, not the current pop sensation). From an early age, he escaped small-town boredom through music. At first, his tastes ran toward traditional hits. \u201cI remember having a bunch of pop records when I was really young: No Doubt and Michael Jackson and Garth Brooks. That was when I was pretty passive as a listener\u2014I liked them, but maybe I got to them because my mom or one of my sisters had them. The first I really got obsessed with was a Doc Watson collection. I was already starting to play guitar, and my uncle told my mom to get it for me. He was my first guitar hero.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs he developed as a writer, though, he found himself drawn toward the smartest and sharpest of the class of songwriters who developed in the 1970s: artists like Paul Simon, John Prine, and Randy Newman. And he didn\u2019t just listen to them. He learned from them. Specifically, he learned the finer points of songcraft. \u201cI've been a big fan of Paul Simon for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cHe has this capacity to surprise you with his music and his lyrics. With John Prine's songs, I grew from believing that they happened to him to understanding that it didn\u2019t matter if they really happened to him. And Randy Newman? Wow. I especially love a record like Trouble in Paradise, when there are all these artificial 1980s production techniques, but they\u2019re being used in the service of this master composer.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat respect for tradition\u2014but more specifically for the fact that so-called traditional artists were in fact consistent risk-takers\u2014fuel Ellis\u2019s new record. \u201cWith this record,\u201d he says, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve gotten to where I can use the material of my own life as a jumping-off point. But now I can do different things with that material.\u201d In this case, of course, the material has an element of melancholy. Much of the record revolves around the dissolution of Ellis\u2019s marriage. It\u2019s a breakup album, but not one that dissects its subject with straightforward rage and regret\u2014Ellis and his ex-wife remain friends, and she is even featured in the album art, which was created after the divorce. Rather, it\u2019s an album that finds Ellis reaching back into the trick bags of masters like Simon, Prine, and Newman, and employing the full complement of skills that he\u2019s learned from them. \u201c\u2018Perfect Strangers,\u2019 took a month,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a notepad and walked around New York, giving myself personal therapy through the eyes of the city.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther songs came faster. \u201cI wrote \u2018Elephant\u201d quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's about my misunderstanding of monogamy and my complete bewilderment with some of the ideas that I grew up with. I felt that in the past year, lots of constructs I took for granted were turned on their head. But I was careful to express those ideas in a way where the gray areas got to stay gray. If what you\u2019re saying is that you\u2019re confused, you shouldn't say you're confused. You should betray a contradiction.\u201d\n\n\n\nEllis isn\u2019t afraid of sophistication. The beautifully orchestrated \u201cYou\u2019re Not the One\u201d has more complex origins than its title might suggest. \u201cFor that one, I woke up from a nightmare that was a kind of sex dream. In the dream, the faces around me kept changing. It was very eerie, like a David Lynch movie. The song has that sense of unease but also this Ellington bridge that\u2019s unrelated to the key of the song. I\u2019m really proud of that one.\u201d But he can make his point with simplicity also, as in the chorus to \u201cDrivin\u2019,\u201d a co-write with Angaleena Presley: \u201cThis don\u2019t feel like living, it\u2019s just surviving / I\u2019m ain\u2019t going nowhere, I\u2019m just driving.\u201d And then there\u2019s \u201cHigh Road,\u201d the emotional center of the record, co-written with friend Jonny Fritz, a song about professional and personal insecurity that builds from lonesome shivers to almost operatic melodrama\u2014all the while riding a lovely, fragile melody.\n\n\n\nWhile Ellis wrote nine of the album\u2019s songs, he is also a generous collaborator dedicated to finding songs from other writers who advance his vision. \u201cOnce I knew that much of the record would be composed of these extremely personal songs like \u2018Elephant\u2019 or \u2018High Road,\u2019 but I was aware from the start that I couldn\u2019t have a whole record of them. Putting it together was like assembling a collection of short stories. You need different tones and colors. So that\u2019s why I included a song like \u2018How I Love You,\u2019 which was written by my friend Matt Vasquez, from Delta Spirit. We were hanging out, and I asked him if he had any good uptempo songs, and he showed me that one. And \u2018Screw\u2019 was written by Kelly Doyle, who plays guitar in our band. Listening to him work on his solo record, I was amazed by the sound. His process and palette were really inspirational to me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe album ends with \u201cIt's Not OK,\u201d which holds its ground as a traditional busted-love song before hurtling headlong into a dark thicket of guitars. \u201cIn that case, because the song is about that kind of emotional trouble, part of me that wanted dissonance and chaos. The melodic and rhythmic ideas to me are a different kind of information from the lyrics, but they\u2019re still information.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs thoughtful as Ellis is about the process, his album also has plenty of pop pleasures. \u201cCalifornia\u201d is a jaunty, intimate travelogue that elevates into his chorus. \u201cAmanda Jane\u201d has an almost bossa nova shuffle and a melody that splits the difference between power pop and 70s soft rock. And \u201cCouples Skate\u201d reaches back even further. \u201cI wrote that one while were on tour with Richard Thompson. It\u2019s a green room song. I was just journaling, and I remembered holding this girl\u2019s hand in second grade. It\u2019s a nostalgic idea, which is why I reached for a 50s soul vibe. But it\u2019s also nineties, in a way\u2014something about it that reminds me of the rock and roll I was listening to around that time.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the end, Robert Ellis (the album) is the most accurate reflection yet of Robert Ellis (the man). It\u2019s analytical and emotional, calculated in spots and improvisational in others, restless, peaceful, never indifferent, never dispassionate.\n\n\n\nROBERT ELLIS DISCOGRAPHY\n\nThe Great Rearranger (2009)\n\nPhotographs (2011)\n\nThe Lights From The Chemical Plant (2014)\n\nRobert Ellis (2016)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8984360.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.421431, 37.75704], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Folk", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Amado's"}, {"Address": "853 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Jim McVeigh", "ArtistBio": "Jim McVeigh is a stand up comic based in the SF Bay Area.

SoCal punk quartet The Bombpops are still caught up in the first part of that saying, though: Formed in 2007 by co-frontwomen Jen Razavi and Poli van Dam, The Bombpops are just now getting their debut full-length, Fear Of Missing Out, out into the world. However, according to Razavi, there are a lot of very valid reasons for the delay. First off, the intervening decade found The Bombpops endure an absurd amount of lineup changes. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three drummers and six bass players,\u201d Razavi says with a sigh. \u201cEach time felt like starting over.\u201d Adding to that was an opportunity to work with No Use For A Name frontman Tony Sly, who expressed interest in producing the band before his sudden death in 2012. \u201cI had one of the best conversations in my life with Tony at Punk Rock Bowling in May, and then he passed away in July,\u201d Razavi laments. The band, hot off of two well-received EPs on Red Scare Industries, re-focused with yet another new lineup (this one, featuring bassist Neil Wayne and drummer Josh Lewis, having the magic touch \u201dwe finally have the best rhythm section we could ever ask for,\u201d Razavi gushes), but then found themselves sidelined again\u2014this time due to some positive news: van Dam was pregnant with her first child. The experience helped bring the band members closer together, even though it meant the band itself had to take a hiatus. \u201cWe learned a lot about each other through that,\u201d Razavi says. \u201cWe took a break, and we\u2019ve come back harder than we ever have. People literally told us, \u2018You can\u2019t tour, Poli can\u2019t be in a band.\u2019 Who are you to say that? It\u2019s situational for every single person.\u201d That motivation manifests itself into equal parts intensity and poppiness on Fear Of Missing Out, from the grungy \u201cJerk\u201d to the sticky-sweet pop-punk of \u201cCA In July\u201d and the hard-edged slammers \u201cI Can\u2019t\u201d and \u201cBrake Lights.\u201d Razavi credits producer Chris Fogal, also of Colorado pop-punk lifers The Gamits, of elevating their songs to new heights. \u201cThe Gamits are a band favorite, and we just love Chris\u2019 songwriting so much,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had songs we felt were finished, and we had songs that weren\u2019t finished, and we knew each of those things could be a little bit better in some ways. We vibed really well with Chris.\u201d The Bombpops recorded in Fogal\u2019s Colorado studio, Black In Bluhm, for two weeks in April 2016, eventually delivering 12 catchy punk songs that are as sonically diverse as they are high energy. It may have taken them a decade to get there, but the album is an outstanding document of resilience coupled with a healthy dose of cynicism to keep things balanced. \u201cIt\u2019s taken our whole band\u2019s life to make this record, but we\u2019re lucky we waited this long to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the right time. I\u2019m a big fan of the shiny, polished-sounding record, and we got to make that for our first record. It\u2019s so clich\u00e9 and cheesy to say, but it\u2019s more mature, especially the vocals. We learned how to sing. We learned how to have more movement in our melodies. We learned a lifelong lesson of how to be in a band and get along together and make things happen.\u201d Fear Of Missing Out effectively communicates The Bombpops\u2019 influences, both from their childhood and their touring years. For example, \u201cSweet For Sorrow\u201d and \u201cMarry. Fuck. Kill.\u201d each date back to 2008, when the band was still heavily influenced by California skatepunk titans. \u201cWe are basically a product of Southern California, born and raised here,\u201d Razavi says. \u201cWe absolutely grew up on Bad Religion, Pennywise, No Use For A Name and Strung Out.\u201d But it\u2019s \u201cBe Sweet\u201d that shows the deeper side of The Bombpops: The music is original, but the song\u2019s lyrics were actually written by an all-around rad dude who sadly is no longer with us. Razavi\u2019s voice perks up as she tells the incredible story. \u201cBack in 2009, we were partying in a hotel room with Ray and Brandon Carlisle from Teenage Bottlerocket,\u201d she begins. \u201cThere was a guitar there, and Brandon was showing ideas for songs. He wrote all the lyrics to \u2018Be Sweet\u2019 on four sheets of hotel paper, and I held onto it.\u201d After Brandon\u2019s untimely passing in 2015, The Bombpops reached out to Ray to seek permission to record the song, which he granted; it was then named \u201cBe Sweet\u201d in tribute to the late drummer, as a nod to his catchphrase. \u201cWe didn\u2019t leave one lyric out,\u201d Razavi says. \u201cThose are, word for word, Brandon Carlisle\u2019s lyrics.\u201d The Bombpops\u2019 career has been littered with false starts, flakey rhythm sections and life getting in the way, but now, The Bombpops are laser-focused, thanks in part to their new home. \u201cIt\u2019s so crazy,\u201d Razavi admits. \u201cSince I was 15, all I wanted to do was be on Fat Wreck Chords. It\u2019s the same with my bandmates. It literally is a dream come true. I used to look up to bands on Fat, but now, my best friend Rosie in toyGuitar is signed to Fat Wreck Chords. Bad Cop/Bad Cop, those girls are our girls. We love them.

Special in that it was written with the group of musicians/writers who also played on it, \u201cthis album was about discovering the original songs as they were being recorded\u201d and mastering the courage to \u201clet the songs choose their own path.\u201d The new album includes several songs bearing Peyroux\u2019s distinctive, instantly recognizable style including On My Own and Sunday afternoon, but Anthem\u2019s spirit was that of exploring new styles whilst resting safe in the knowledge that \u201cif you are loyal to yourself, there should always be a thread running through your music.\u201d", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8791751.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Blues, Pop", "OtherInfo": "Madeleine Peyroux (10/6/19)", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse"}, {"Address": "1030 Main St, Napa, CA 94559", "Artist": "Mark De Clive-Lowe", "ArtistBio": "Exploring culture through music...", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8768375.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.285583, 38.29958], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: jazz, electronic", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Blue Note Napa"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero West, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Eliane Elias", "ArtistBio": "Exploring culture through music...", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.279289, 37.796471], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz", "OtherInfo": "ELIANE ELIAS", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland"}, {"Address": "2937 Mission, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Danny Castro", "ArtistBio": "Exploring culture through music...", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.417887, 37.750037], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "Savanna Jazz Jam with Eric Tillman, Danny Castro, and Nick Fishman at Savanna Jazz Club: Savanna stands out in its neighborhood: it's almost as if a North Beach jazz club dropped a spore on Mission Street.

Hailing from Phoenix, Arizona, a majority of the band's lyrics are direct Ned quotes. The band's current members include Head Ned, Dread Ned, Shred Ned and Zed Ned.\n\nEstablished in 2015 with original members Head Ned, Red Ned, Bled Ned, Stead Ned and Thread Ned, the band found success before ever playing their first show, becoming a viral phenomenon after releasing just a few press photos and a 4-song demo. Within 2 weeks, the band had nearly 30,000 Facebook fans and was featured by numerous publications including Billboard, Time, The Independent, BBC, Esquire, Vice and many more.\nIn November of 2016 the band released their debut album, 'Howdilly Doodilly', a 13-track catalog filled with Flanderisms, rushing guitars and more than enough left-handed puns. Following the departure of bassist Thread Ned and guitarist Stead Ned for left hand conversion therapy, the band acquired guitarist Dead Ned and bassist Cred Ned. In 2017, the band took on a relentless touring schedule across the US and North America, playing nearly 100 shows to neighborinos everywhere.\n\nFollowing a short hiatus through 2017 and early 2018, the band regrouped in July of 2018 with a brand new lineup, introducing Shred Ned on guitar, Dread Ned on drums and Zed Ned on synth.\n\nOkilly Dokilly's live shows are high energy affairs that weave together comedy and brutality.

In bringing the album to life, vocalist/guitarist Joey Burns and drummer John Convertino found a spiritual home in unusual surroundings\u2014not in Arizona, but on the Northern California coast in a home-turned-studio called the Panoramic House. Built from debris and shipyard-salvaged timber\u2014and dubbed \u201cThe Phantom Ship\u201d by the band\u2014the grandiose house and its edge-of-the-world-like ambience soon made their way into the songs. The specter of California also had a powerful effect: as both dream state and nightmare, its infinite duality is mirrored in the music, giving Calexico a new direction and new edge. With less polish and more grit than ever before, The Thread That Keeps Us both honors enduring traditions and reveals Calexico\u2019s confidence in songwriting, ultimately setting a whole new standard for the band.\n\nAs heard on the album\u2019s lead single and opening track, the drama of the landscape directly impacted the making of The Thread That Keeps Us. Driven by sing-song melody and galloping rhythms, \u201cEnd of the World with You\u201d discovers an unlikely romanticism in volatile times. With its lyrics illuminating \u201cLove in the age of the extremes,\u201d the track is the perfect intro to an album that endlessly explores the contrast between bright and dark, hope and fear.\n\nWorking with their longtime engineer Craig Schumacher, Calexico co-produced The Thread That Keeps Us, gathering musicians from across the globe to dream up an earthy yet expansive sound spiked with jagged guitar tones and flashes of distortion. \u201cThere\u2019s a little more chaos and noise in the mix than what we\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d Burns points out. Although that chaos has much to do with \u201cwhere we\u2019re at right now as a planet,\u201d it also echoes Calexico\u2019s dedication to constant experimentation. \u201cWhenever we\u2019re writing and we come up with something that feels too familiar, someone will end up saying, \u2018That feels good, but let\u2019s keep going and see what else we can uncover,\u2019\u201d Burns says. \u201cIt\u2019s been really important to the arc of this band\u2019s evolution for us to always keep on trying new things.\u201d\n\nLike \u201cEnd of the World with You,\u201d much of The Thread That Keeps Us captures the anxieties and unease of living in tumultuous times. But while the album draws a kinetic energy from all that uncertainty, its lyrics unfold with a literary nuance and sense of setting and character. \u201cInstead of writing straight-up protest songs, I want to tell stories,\u201d Burns says. Largely inspired by his wanderings around Northern California during the album\u2019s production, the narratives embedded in The Thread That Keeps Us reflect on displacement, transitory existence, and\u2014in Burns\u2019s words\u2014\u201creturning to your home after being gone for some time and seeing how things have changed, and maybe not in the best way.\u201d\n\nAs the exact embodiment of that theme, \u201cThrown to the Wild\u201d delivers one of the most mesmerizing moments on The Thread That Keeps Us. With its gritty but poetic storytelling, the song opens on a downtown bus station late at night, its sleepy rhythms and atmospheric haze intensifying the bleakness of the scene (sample lyric: \u201cHome\u2019s waiting like a motherless child\u201d). From there, \u201cThrown to the Wild\u201d slips into a glorious frenzy of hummed harmonies, sprawling guitar lines, and Jacob Valenzuela\u2019s sorrowful trumpet playing, the effect both hypnotic and jarring. \u201cWe wanted the second part of the song to just open into this sea of chaos,\u201d says Burns, adding: \u201cSometimes chaos can be a good thing.\u201d\n\nEclectic in sound and feeling, The Thread That Keeps Us also offers the measured fury of \u201cBridge to Nowhere,\u201d the triumphant grooves of the Spanish-sung \u201cFlores y Tamales,\u201d the meditative rhythms and jangly guitar riffs of \u201cAnother Space.\u201d On \u201cThe Town & Miss Lorraine,\u201d shimmering tones and delicate mandolin melodies play against the darkly cinematic mood of the lyrics (\u201cSliding into the sea/With cynicism and rum/Watching Miss Lorraine/Smoking alone with the moon\u201d). The most brutal track on The Thread That Keeps Us, \u201cDead in the Water\u201d builds a thrilling menace from its snarling guitar riffs, frantic piano rhythms, and piercing lyrics penned for what Burns describes as \u201cthe antagonist to the story of the album\u2014a kind of monster\u201d (\u201cDon\u2019t try to look away or stop me in my path/I make the law and I decree a new kind of wrath\u201d). And woven throughout The Thread That Keeps Us are a series of instrumental interludes, including the lilting folk of \u201cUnconditional Waltz\u201d and the dreamy psychedelia of \u201cSpinball.\u201d \u201cGoing into making the album, the only thing I really knew for sure was that I wanted there to be moments that felt free and spontaneous\u2014just these moments of no time, no lyrics, no agenda,\u201d says Burns.\n\nOne of the most stirring tracks on The Thread That Keeps Us, \u201cGirl in the Forest\u201d spins a gentle fable from its near despair over the state of the planet (\u201cWell the world was spinning so fast, nobody took the time\u201d). \u201cThat song wouldn\u2019t have been written unless I was sitting next to my daughter Twyla, who was humming along as I was making up this melody,\u201d says Burns. \u201cFor months we tried finishing the lyrics together; I was leading with this idea about environmentalism and protesters in the forest, and I thought there could be some sort of spirit who appears. And then my daughter told me, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s cool\u2014but maybe it\u2019s just a girl who\u2019s friends with all the animals.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith \u201cGirl in the Forest,\u201d The Thread That Keeps Us displays a sensibility that\u2019s long informed Calexico\u2019s songwriting: a transcendentalist infatuation with the wild beauty of nature, a fascination deepened during their time at Panoramic House. \u201cBeing up there on the mountain and taking walks on the shore, and even swimming in the cold water, we couldn\u2019t help but be inspired by nature,\u201d says Convertino. \u201cOur love for our earth, our home, and the future of our children came into focus even more, giving the inspiration and desire to give back something that\u2019s positive and beautiful and life-affirming.\u201d\n\nIn that life-affirming spirit, Calexico decided to end The Thread That Keeps Us with a moment of fragile optimism. Described by Burns as \u201ca love song for my kids,\u201d the piano-laced, sweetly swaying \u201cMusic Box\u201d speaks to preserving dreams in a troubled reality. \u201cRight now we\u2019re at the edge of another potential crisis unfolding, and it\u2019s haunting every night as you put your kids to sleep,\u201d says Burns. \u201cBut at the same time, you look into a child\u2019s eyes and you see something hopeful, even if they\u2019ve maybe heard little pieces of what\u2019s going on in the news. I think that\u2019s pretty much the case with this band: we still have hope, and we\u2019re still so excited to be making this music together.\u201d\n\n\nCALEXICO ARE: Joey Burns, John Convertino, Martin Wenk, Jacob Valenzuela, Sergio Mendoza, Jairo Zavala Ruiz, and Scott Colberg.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8209458.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.06325, 37.257026], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Americana, Country, Rock, Folk", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Mountain Winery"}, {"Address": "14831 Pierce Rd, Saratoga, CA 95070", "Artist": "Calexico & Iron & Wine", "ArtistBio": "The ninth studio album from Calexico, \"The Thread That Keeps Us\" is a timely snapshot of the Arizona-bred band: a family portrait capturing their stylistic variety and unpredictability while still finding solace in limitless creativity.

A native of Leesburg, Florida, Croker is the grandson of the late great jazz trumpeter Doc Cheatham. He began playing trumpet around age 11 after hearing Cheatham play in New York City, and by his teens was studying music at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in Jacksonville, Florida. From 2003 to 2007, Croker attended the music conservatory at Oberlin College. While at Oberlin, he was mentored by legendary trumpeter and educator Donald Byrd. Also during this time, he earned the Presser Music Foundation Award, which funded his debut album, 2006's Fundamentals. After graduating Oberlin, Croker relocated to China, where he took up residency at Shanghai's House of Blues. His 2009 album, In the Tradition, paid tribute to Cheatham.\n\nIn 2013, Croker returned to the States and began work on his third solo album, the Dee Dee Bridgewater-produced Afro Physicist. Released in 2014 on OKeh/Sony Masterworks Records, the Echo Award nominated album found him branching out stylistically, weaving elements of funk, Latin jazz, and hip-hop into his sound. In 2016, he delivered Escape Velocity, which found him delving deeper into a genre-bending, spiritually enlightened, funk-influenced jazz sound.\n\nUpon the album\u2019s release, The Wall Street Journal heralded the album as \u201c timeless and of-the-moment\u201d. His live performances, the Huffington Post lauded Croker\u2019s band DVRKFUNK, saying they were \u201ca tight front line that weave in serpentine precision and are backed by a powerful rhythm section that pushes the groove.\u201d Outside of his solo career, Croker has lent his inimitable talents as composer, arranger and musician to J.

A timeless blend of classic soul, infectious R&B, and modern pop, the record captures the sound of a veteran songwriter confidently breaking new ground, blazing his own distinctive trail through uncharted territory with comfort and style. Simultaneously vulnerable and self-assured, the songs reflect both the rich well of experience from which they\u2019re drawn and the bold leap that they represent, pairing intimate, introspective lyricism with effortless swagger and monster hooks. Wilder Woods is a new side of Rinehart, but one that he\u2019s more than ready to share.\nDrawing the inspiration for his new musical moniker from his two sons, Wilder Rinehart and Woods Rinehart, Wilder Woods knew he couldn\u2019t expect his sons to see the value in taking bold, potentially life changing chances if he wasn\u2019t willing to do it himself. So, foregoing the comfort and security he\u2019d built across a storied career in music thus far, he set about building a brand new sound from the ground up, one that was refined yet approachable, sophisticated yet raw, modern yet classic. He crafted songs with a series of collaborators in Nashville (where he and his family would soon move full time) and teamed up with rising producer Gabe Simon, whose indie pop approach proved to be the perfect counterweight to his own old school sensibilities.\n\u201cThis music represents a new direction and something totally fresh for me,\u201d he says, \u201cso I wanted to find a producer that I had never worked with before who could match that energy. Gabe was perfect because he came from a completely different musical world, but he was still somebody I could get really deep into guitar tones and harmonic structure and rhythmic ideas with.\u201d\nWhile the early demos often included digital elements, Wilder Woods assembled an all-star band, including but not limited to Tyler Burkum, Jeremy Lutito, Ian Fitchuk, Darren King, Jesse Baylin and The Watson Twins, to record everything live in the studio, humanizing the intricate arrangements with passionate, explosive performances. The result is a singular blend of old and new, like a vintage Eldorado retrofitted with a 21st century engine. It\u2019s a captivating duality, one that mirrors the split personality of the project as a whole.\n\u201cThere are two distinct sides to this album,\u201d says Wilder Woods. \u201cThere\u2019s the Wilder side, which is all about love and flirtation and desire, and the Woods side, which is more serious\nand reflective. We all contain multitudes, and you have to recognize and honor all the different parts of yourself if you ever want to feel whole.\u201d\nThe record opens with the seductive \u201cLight Shine In,\u201d a gorgeous meditation that revs its way up from a delicate whisper to a spiritual roar. Fueled by Woods\u2019 stop-you-in-your-tracks vocals, the songs play out like a Wilder Woods manifesto, a stream of consciousness plea that sets the stage perfectly for an album all about understanding, forgiveness, and self-love in a world that\u2019s conditioned us to feel like we\u2019ll never be enough. The tender \u201cSomeday Soon,\u201d meanwhile, wrestles with internalized doubt and shame, and the stripped-down \u201cReligion\u201d challenges conventional notions of happiness and success.\nAs much as Wilder Woods\u2019 children inspired him to put pen to paper on this album, it\u2019s clear that his wife, Mary Reames Rinehart, is an ever-present muse. He taps into the lightning he felt the first time they met on the explosive \u201cElectric Woman,\u201d offers reassurance in the face of uncertainty on \u201cMary, You\u2019re Wrong,\u201d and imagines the life ahead of them in their new home on the gospel-influenced \u201cHillside House.\u201d\n\u201cMarriage and fatherhood have shown me that the hard times are what teach you the most about who you are,\u201d he reflects. \u201cNobody else can give that to you. You have to experience it for yourself.\u201d\nHis burning desire to experience the unknown reached an apex during a rare break in 2017 from his relentless tour schedule with NEEDTOBREATHE, the chart-topping rock band he co-founded in his hometown of Possum Kingdom, South Carolina. Bear Rinehart felt as if he was watching his sons grow up at light speed. He wanted to stop time, if only for a moment, and write a letter, both to himself and to his kids. Looking back on his own childhood, 15 years with NEEDTOBREATHE, chart topping releases, GRAMMY nominations, multiple sold out tours and the like, he asked himself the harder questions:\nWhat would life look like if we strive to enjoy the journey as much as destination, the struggle as much the victory? What risks would we take if we could see our mistakes for the gifts that they really are?\nIn that respect, \u2018Wilder Woods\u2019 is as much about self-discovery as it is about leading by example, about daring you to be bold and take your own leap towards realizing your truest self. Think of these songs as little beacons of light, lanterns to help guide you on your passage into the unknown. As Thoreau put it, \u201cIf one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.\u201d Wilder Woods is proof of that.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9137979.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Independent"}, {"Address": "2174 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114", "Artist": "Juan Wauters", "ArtistBio": "The singer of The Beets and Queens representative\n\n'N.A.P.

From an early age he sang in a choir, studied piano and honed his writing skills with journalism courses, even working as a cub reporter at the Ottawa Citizen. By 13, he had his own vocal group, the Bobbysoxers. Blinded by determination, he would take his mother\u2019s car and drive to perform at every amateur night he could across the river in Quebec. Soon after, he won a trip to New York by winning a Campbell\u2019s soup contest that required him to spend three months collecting soup can labels. After visiting the music hub of New York, was there that his dream to make it as a singer composer was solidified. There was not a doubt in his young tenacious mind.\n\nIn 1956, he convinced his parents to let him travel to Los Angeles to visit his uncle, where he hitchhiked to a meeting with Modern Records that led to the release of Anka\u2019s first single, \u201cBlau-Wile Deveest Fontaine.\u201d The inspiration for the song came from a book he was reading for a report he had to write for Fisher Park school by the former Governor General of Canada, John Buchan. Although it was not a hit, Anka kept plugging away. He went so far as to sneak into Fats Domino\u2019s dressing room in Ottawa to meet him and his manager. In the dressing room, Fats Domino and Chuck Berry were sitting there and Anka sang his music to them. They told him to stay in school. When Anka returned to New York in 1957, he scored a meeting with Don Costa, the A&R representative for ABC-Paramount Records, playing him a batch of songs that included \u201cDiana\u201d. Costa was duly enthusiastic about the potential of the young singer and songwriter. The rapid and enormous success of \u201cDiana\u201d, his first number one hit, made him a star at the young age of 15.\n\nSoon Paul found himself traveling by bus with the \u2018Cavalcade of Stars\u2019 with the top names of the day. He honed his craft surrounded by the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly, Frankie Lymon, and Chuck Berry. Anka was the youngest entertainer to ever perform at the Copacabana.\n\nAfter a few hit songs, Anka confident in his talent as a writer wisely knew that being a songwriter meant the power was in the pen. As a result, he went on to write for Connie Francis, Leslie Gore, and Buddy Holly (including the last song Holly ever recorded, \u201cIt Doesn\u2019t Matter Anymore\u201d). Other hit songs include the Academy Award-nominated theme for the 1962 film in which he starred, The Longest Day. He notably penned the longest running theme in television history for The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.\n\nSongwriting and performing \u201care what gave me the confidence to keep going,\u201d he says. In the early 60\u2019s, he became a junior associate of Sinatra and the Rat Pack. Even with the British invasion, Anka still had chart records. He moved to Italy and outsold the Italians, selling an astonishing 4 million records there. In the late 60\u2019s, Anka wrote \u201cMy Way\u201d for Frank Sinatra and by the 70\u2019s, he had another string of hits like \u201c(You\u2019re) Having My Baby\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Like To Sleep Alone\u201d, and \u201cTimes Of Your Life\u201d which confirmed his status as an icon of popular music.\n\nHis later achievements as a recording artist included the charted song, \u201cHold Me \u2018Til the Morning Comes,\u201d a hit duet with Peter Cetera in 1983, the Spanish-language album Amigos in 1996, and Body of Work, a 1998 duets album that featured Frank Sinatra, Celine Dion, Tom Jones and daughter Anthea Anka. If this wasn\u2019t enough, it was revealed upon its release in 2009, that Anka co-wrote Michael Jackson\u2019s posthumous #1 worldwide hit, \u201cThis Is It,\u201d which has further cemented his place upon the most prolific and versatile songwriters of any generation.\n\nNot one to rest on his laurels, Rock Swings and Classic Songs, My Way \u2013 ingeniously featured songs originally created by some of the biggest rock performers of the day. Anka, of course, did the songs \u2018his way.\u2019 Rock Swings went Top 10 in the UK, and was certified gold in the UK, France, and Canada, hit No. 2 on Billboard\u2019s Top Jazz Albums chart and went on to sell half a million units worldwide.\n\nOn November 15, 2011, Anka released his first Christmas album in decades. Songs of December featured\u202flush romantic versions of popular Christmas songs such as \u201cLet It Snow\u201d, \u201cBaby It\u2019s Cold Outside\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home for Christmas\u201d. All were recorded with a full orchestra in the renowned Capitol studios and sung by a music legend. It is a true holiday classic.\n\nIn April 2013, Anka released his New York Times Bestselling autobiography, published by St. Martin\u2019s Press, entitled My Way. This autobiography is a remarkable story of a decades-long career as an entertainer, actor, and songwriter. During the same time, his new 14-song album entitled Duets was released by Sony Music Entertainment and featured artists such as Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Tom Jones, Celine Dion, and Michael Bubl\u00e9 (who Anka was with from the start of his career as well as co-producer on his self-titled album in 2003). Duets provides a musical journey through the life and times of Paul Anka and includes heartfelt liner notes written by Anka himself as an introduction to the classic songs he and his collaborators have chosen. Duets set a milestone in Billboard Chart history because with the CD, Anka became the only artist to have a CD on the Billboard Top 100 Chart for seven consecutive decades.\n\nIn 2014, Anka saw the release of another song he co-wrote with Michael Jackson entitled \u201cLove Never Felt So Good\u201d off of Jackson\u2019s album Xscape. The song was also recorded as a duet with Justin Timberlake. As lead song off of Jackson\u2019s CD and it\u2019s first single, it has received massive radio, sales, and critical success and reached #1 in over 50 countries.\n\nMost recently in 2018, Anka\u2019s collaboration with Michael Jackson and Drake on the song \u201cDon\u2019t Matter to Me\u201d was released on Drake\u2019s \u201cScorpion\u201d. The song alone had over 400 million downloads and reached the top 10 on Billboard charts.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8664101.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.890837, 37.334762], "Date": "Sun Oct 6 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-06", "Genre": "Genres: Jazz, Jazz Blues, Pop, Swing, Soft Rock, ROCK, ROLL, Doo Wop", "OtherInfo": "A Note from Paul: \"The Anka Sings Sinatra tour will honor a great artist who has influenced me more than anyone else throughout my career, Frank Sinatra.

They wrote initially about their own lives, growing up at the height of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, in songs like \"Suspect Device\" and \"Wasted Life\". In November of '77, they released those two songs on their own Rigid Digits label, and sent a copy to BBC Radio One DJ John Peel, who started playing it every night.\n\nThese were the first of what became SLF's signature style: lyrics that meld the personal and political, music that combines the energy of punk with infectious hooks, and delivery that rings of honesty and commitment. In 1979 they became the first band ever to hit the UK top 20 album charts on an independent label with their debut Inflammable Material.\n\nAfter 10 studio albums and countless tours, Stiff Little Fingers find themselves more in demand than ever. In 2014 they released their latest studio album, No Going Back.

His formal training in economics and history at the University of Michigan bring an uncommon depth and historical context. Doctor Striker exclaims: \"If you fight the man, you are the man If I'm rich, no one can touch me. / If I'm rich, I am the law. / But I'm poor, I don't care. / I am poor, I am free.\"\n\nDoctor Striker teamed up with Guinevere Q, Will Xiong, and Young Sun for the live shows to create a full sensory, theatrical live experience.

Will fills the sound with his tones and Young Sun drives the drums.\n\nDoctor Striker is celebratory and critical, insightful but ecstatic. By committing to a pop ethos, he avoids joining the half-baked rocker-philosopher tradition. Indeed, if Doctor Striker believes in anything, it's in the eternal truth of heavy riffs.

Originally from West Marin County, he made his way down the California coast through Santa Cruz, writing songs, jamming in garages and performing at every open mic he could find while simultaneously earning a BA in Film & Digital Media and Literature from the University of California Santa Cruz.\n\nHe then immediately moved to Los Angeles where he wrote and arranged his acoustic-laced debut studio album, Californicana. The album was produced by LA producer Marc Danzeisen (Riverdogs, Powerslide, Gilby Clarke), and features saxophonist Jeremy Trezona (Saint Motel), as well as guitarists Johnny Hawthorn (Toad The Wet Sprocket, Everclear) and Manny Alvarez (Jackson Browne, Lucinda Williams), among others. It released independently under Bourne\u2019s own Robotic Records with a successful sold out record release show at the historic (and now permanently closed) House of Blues on the Sunset Strip Foundation Room, followed by a 15-date California Tour.\n\nOn his 2015 debut, Frankie took a stance as a solo artist and emerged on the scene equipped with infectious roots-rock songs, and an authentic indie sound that, \"combines the style of new Americana with all the things you loved about 90s adult alternative bands\" (TourWorthy.com), and \"a smoky, quick-tongued lyrical quality that can change speeds like a Zack Greinke change-up\" (San Jose Rock Music Examiner). His first solo effort has been incredibly well-received by Indie, Rock and Americana radio stations nationwide, and won an award for best love song on the Jango Radio 2015 Valentine's Day Playlist, who call it, \"a refreshing roots rock record for the 21st Century\".\n\nAfter a hard-fought six years in the Los Angeles music scene, Frankie returned to his native San Francisco Bay Area in 2016, where his new band has quickly begun to make a name for themselves in the North Bay for their explosive, jam-oriented live shows, and their melodic roots-rock music that bridges eras of influence. Featuring drummer Jeff Nassi (Meredith Brooks, Fillmore Slim, Unauthorized Rolling Stones), guitarist Sunil Sharma (Alison Harris, Reality Check, Blusion), and bassist Matt Pasquale (Gravity Hill), Bourne\u2019s new band is his primary focus of late. They enter Prairie Sun Studios in Spring 2018 to cut an album under Robotic Records.\n\nOn February 17th 2017 Frankie released Valley of Vindication, a 5-track EP of songs that showcase a softer, more acoustic direction to his sound.

Digitally fueled isolation may be a theme, but this virtuosic acoustic quintet offers its warmest, most emotive and elegantly melodic work to date\u2014so invitingly human in its approach that it practically ushers the listener into the room as these guys assemble in front of a mic.\n\nIndeed, a longing for community and connection was both impetus and inspiration for this disc. Never a group that could be accused of taking it easy, Punch Brothers had been touring almost non-stop since the majority of them first got together to support mandolin player Chris Thile\u2019s 2006 solo album, How to Grow a Woman From the Ground. (And whenever they did take a break from their official Punch Brothers duties, the individual members engaged in a staggering array of solo and collaborative projects with fellow travelers in the worlds of bluegrass, jazz, and classical music.) But in February 2013, after supporting the 2012 disc Who\u2019s Feeling Young Now?\u2014an album in which, a New York Times reviewer opined, the band \u201cshifted the emphasis from instrumental wizardry to playful storytelling\u201d \u2014Punch Bothers decided to scale back the concert schedule allowing themselves the chance to interact musically and personally, away from tour buses and dressing rooms.\n\nAs guitarist Chris Eldridge explains, \u201cThere was a sense among all of us that we needed to dial it back a little bit and really give ourselves time to write a record where we didn\u2019t have deadlines and weren\u2019t under pressure to get something out. So we scheduled these writing retreats. The first was in May 2013. We got together for a week in Charleston, South Carolina. We rented a house, and we played a gig\u2014and the gig paid for us to rent the place. We worked on music all day at a steady pace, but it didn\u2019t feel as pressured as it had in the past. We had another one in Telluride, another one in New York. We had about five of them. It was really good for us to have the space to work on something. We could let a song sit for a day or two and then come back to it and ask, does it still feel great\u2014or not? We never had that luxury before.\u201d\n\nOne such retreat took place at Oberlin College, where the band had been invited to participate as artists in residence at its famed conservatory. They conducted master classes, talked and jammed with students, and played in the auditorium. Banjo player Noam Pikelny recalls, \u201cWe had our own room in the conservatory building, surrounded by all these students who are there working their asses off on their instruments and their compositions. To have the opportunity to work on our own stuff while being surrounded by all of that was very inspiring. We were in an environment where we felt a responsibility to make something very special because part of our audience was right outside our door.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the writing sessions, Thile relates, they had animated debates with each other and with the students, about how they relate to music, and to each other, through a digital filter. A narrative began to emerge that informs compositions like the rueful \u201cI Blew It Off\u201d and the ambitious, three-part opener, \u201cFamiliarity\u201d which goes from spare and staccato to lilting and pastoral. No diatribes here: the words are often haunting and impressionistic, while the music boasts its own powerful eloquence.\n\n\u201cWe started writing these songs,\u201d notes violinist Gabe Witcher, \u201cand had enough time to discover what they really are. And as we saw this story emerge, this narrative, we wanted to see if we could also tell the story sonically. \u2018Familiarity,\u2019 the trilogy, is probably the best example of that. It begins very dry, presented very plainly, no effects, as if these are thoughts coming from inside someone\u2019s head. But, as this thing progresses, the craziness of the outside world envelopes the narrator, tries to get into his consciousness. It builds to a climax and then releases into this dream world. He\u2019s not sure where he is\u2014at a club, a church\u2014or what he is hearing. The presentation of that is very dreamlike, otherworldly. The third piece is the morning after, if you will, presented very organically, as if we are just sitting around in a room playing a song. It\u2019s like Sunday morning waking up\u2014what happened last night? Reckoning with the reality of it all. Trying to enhance those themes sonically\u2014that was another step forward for us in the story telling on the record. We touched on that in Who\u2019s Feeling Young Now? as far as using the studio to enhance the music. Now we are really using the studio to help the narrative along.\u201d\n\nThe Phosphorescent Blues is, in many ways, a slice of modern life, says Thile: \u201cGoing out after shows, we\u2019d go to bars that were loud, where the music may not be ideal, to be around other people, to get a sense of the world for a second. And I\u2019d see people just like me on their phones, telling people they wish they were there, texting people who really are there. Then some song would come on in real time and some person knows that song and then they see that someone else does too and maybe they both sing it together and that moment is spiritual, some shared experience, and they are interacting in three dimensions, in the flesh, with their fellow man. And that\u2019s communion. \u2018Familiarity\u2019 and other songs on this record dive into that: how do we cultivate beautiful, three-dimensional experiences with our fellow man in this day and age?\u201d\n\nShortly before the sessions began, Thile and Witcher met with Burnett and discovered the producer had the very same things on his mind. In fact, he\u2019d just given a commencement address at the University of Southern California on the subject of technology and human interaction. Witcher remembers, \u201cThile and I looked at each and said, \u2018This is unbelievable. It\u2019s exactly what we are writing about.\u2019 So this was a perfect, serendipitous union.\u201d\n\nThat union was also a long time coming. Burnett had previously enlisted Punch Brothers to contribute music to the Hunger Games soundtrack he produced. They performed an even greater role on the soundtrack to the Coen Brothers\u2019 Inside Llewyn Davis, and served as the \u201chouse band\u201d for the star-studded Another Day, Another Time concert Burnett organized at NYC\u2019s Town Hall in September 2013. Having Burnett at the helm of these Punch Brothers sessions was a revelatory experience, even for musicians already so finely attuned to each other.\n\n\u201cT Bone understood what we were trying to do and helped us get it even further,\u201d says bassist Paul Kowert. \u201cHe was like a coach and a teammate at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven as much as we had worked with him before, I had no idea what to expect,\u201d Thile admits. \u201cT Bone works in mysterious ways. His genius is he manages to maintain perspective while being fully and utterly engaged and swept up in the excitement and frustration and hope and despair that goes along with trying to coax life out of these assemblages of notes.\u201d In this setting, Thile delivered what are arguably the most expressive vocals of his career, on songs like \u201cJulep\u201d and \u201cForgotten,\u201d bolstered by harmonies that the Beach Boys\u2019 Brian Wilson would approve of. \u201cSinging while T Bone was in the control room, I felt what it was like for an actor to work with a great director. He would find ways to get me into my own lyrics. He might come at things with some observation about the lyric that would allow me to sing it not just as me but as a whole lot of people.\u201d\n\nBurnett himself added a discreet amount of electric guitar, most noticeably on \u201cI Blew It Off,\u201d and even convinced the band to add percussion on some tracks, a first for a Punch Brothers disc\u2014integrated so artfully into the mix by drummer Jay Bellerose that one has to listen twice to even know it\u2019s there. On \u201cForgotten\u201d and \u201cMy Oh My,\u201d Witcher could overdub himself into an entire string section.\n\nThile brought in the Passepied from Claude Debussy's Suite Bergamasque and they built it into an evocative full-band arrangement. Conversely, \u201cMagnet\u201d jettisons the cerebral for joyful reveling in the carnal; its spirited, syncopated groove mirrors the urgency and anticipatory excitement of a looming, late-night assignation.\n\nFinal track \u201cLittle Lights\u201d sums up The Phosphorescent Blues, a single-take recording that imagines countless smart phones held in the air as a symbol of hope and possibility, a 21st century twist on \u201cThis Little Light Of Mine.\u201d At its climax, the band is actually joined by a digital choir of its fans. The band had tried overdubbing their own voices, but that sounded contrived. Then one night, while driving home in L.A., Witcher had a brainstorm: If they didn\u2019t have the resources to assemble a choir in the studio, why not reach out directly to fans, via Twitter and their website, to add their voices? Eldridge reveals, \u201cWe received over a thousand submissions. It wasn\u2019t about people singing well or badly; we just wanted everyone in there.\u201d\n\n\"Little Lights\" becomes a fitting, and genuinely uplifting, conclusion to The Phosphorescent Blues, as Punch Brothers address the questions they've posed about technology by conjuring up, in the course of the song, a very real virtual community. They used all the digital tools they had on hand, but it ultimately came together in a more familiar way, via words and music and voices.\n\n\u2014Michael Hill", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8576443.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Mon Oct 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-07", "Genre": "Genres: Country, Bluegrass", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse"}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero W, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Rick Estrin & The Nightcats", "ArtistBio": "Larger-than-life blues star Rick Estrin has piloted the wildly fun and musically fearless Rick Estrin & The Nightcats for the last decade, touring the world and proving night after night why they won 2018\u2019s Blues Music Award for Band Of The Year.

They serve up insightful, original blues combined with tough rock\u2019n\u2019 roll. This band is superb.\u201d\n\nRick Estrin (harmonica, vocals)\nRick Estrin was born in San Francisco, California in 1949, and grew up fiercely independent. As a 10-year-old boy, he made his way to the tough Market Street area and befriended many of the neighborhood characters. When he was 12, his older sister gave him a copy of Ray Charles\u2019 The Genius Sings The Blues, and he became infatuated with the music. Albums from Jimmy Reed, Champion Jack Dupree, Mose Allison, Nina Simone and others soon followed. By the time he was a teenager, Estrin had immersed himself in the urban, African-American culture surrounding him. He got his first harmonica at age 15, and by age 18 was proficient enough to begin sitting in at black clubs around the city. He first jammed with blues master Lowell Fulson and immediately was hired to open five shows for R&B giant Z.Z. Hill. He worked five nights a week for almost a year with guitar legend Travis Phillips in a band fronted by famed pimp/bluesman Fillmore Slim (who was the centerpiece of the acclaimed Hughes Brothers documentary American Pimp). Slim introduced Estrin to singer Rodger Collins, the man who would become Rick\u2019s first real musical mentor. Collins schooled Rick on the finer points of songwriting and show business. At 19, Estrin relocated to Chicago and worked with some of the city\u2019s best bluesmen. He met and jammed with the legendary Muddy Waters, who told Rick, \u201cYou outta sight, boy! You got that sound! You play like a man!\u201d Muddy wanted Estrin to go on the road with him, but Estrin missed Muddy\u2019s phone call and it never happened. Estrin eventually moved back to the Bay Area, met guitarist Charlie Baty and formed Little Charlie & The Nightcats. With Charlie\u2019s retirement from touring in 2008, Rick brought in guitar virtuoso Kid Andersen and formed Rick Estrin & The Nightcats.\n\nEstrin cites Sonny Boy Williamson II, Percy Mayfield and Detroit bluesman Baby Boy Warren as his major songwriting influences. His work on the reeds is deep in the tradition of harmonica masters Sonny Boy Williamson II and Little Walter Jacobs, while at the same time pushing that tradition forward with his innovative songs. And his sly and soulful vocals are the perfect vehicle for driving those songs home.\n\nKid Andersen (guitar)\nChristoffer \u201cKid\u201d Andersen was born in Telemark, Norway. A blues fan since childhood, Andersen fell in love with the music of Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, Junior Watson, and the Kings (B.B., Albert and Freddie). By the time he was 18, he was backing all the American blues stars who came through Norway, including Homesick James, Nappy Brown and Willie \u201cBig Eyes\u201d Smith. He moved to California when he was 21. Once in the U.S.A., Andersen earned a green card as an \u201cAlien of Extraordinary Ability.\u201d Andersen released four solo albums before joining blues harmonica legend Charlie Musselwhite\u2019s band in 2004, a gig that lasted until he joined Rick Estrin & The Nightcats in 2008. In addition to being an expert multi-instrumentalist (guitar, bass, keyboards, percussion), Kid\u2019s talents as engineer and producer keep his now-famous Greaseland Studio fully booked. Winner of the 2017 Keeping The Blues Alive Award, Greaseland has been featured in The San Jose Mercury News as well as on NPR. At Greaseland, Kid has produced, engineered (and many times played on) albums by artists including Tommy Castro, Nick Moss, John Nemeth, Wee Willie Walker and Finis Tasby, as well as all five Rick Estrin & The Nightcats CDs.\n\nLorenzo Farrell (piano, organ)\nLorenzo Farrell was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and grew up in Bloomington, Indiana, where he started playing piano at age five. During his high school years in California, he discovered jazz and made the switch to upright acoustic bass. After high school, Farrell took several years off from his music career to earn a degree in Philosophy from the University of California at Berkeley, and study religion in Delhi, India. Since returning to the San Francisco Bay Area, he has been a highly sought-after multi-instrumentalist, having returned to piano and mastered the organ in recent years. A Nightcat since 2003, Lorenzo has also had the opportunity to perform and/or record with many other artists, including Wee Willie Walker, Elvin Bishop, Finis Tasby, Jackie Payne, Andy Santana, Terry Hanck and Little Charlie Baty\u2019s Organ Grinder Swing.\n\nDerrick \u201cD\u2019Mar\u201d Martin (drums)\nDerrick \u201cD\u2019Mar\u201d Martin is simply a force of nature. D\u2019Mar is a musician, producer, songwriter, singer, educator, entertainer and motivational speaker. He traveled the world for 17 years as the drummer for the legendary Little Richard. D\u2019Mar has also worked with a number of other artists including Dorothy Moore, Bobby Rush, Vasti Jackson, Ali Ollie Woodson (The Temptations), Big Jack Johnson, Carla Thomas, Billy Preston, Roy Gaines, Mitch Woods, Jackie Payne, Syl Johnson, Bob Margolin and Tutu Jones.

This band is superb.\u201d\n\nRick Estrin (harmonica, vocals)\nRick Estrin was born in San Francisco, California in 1949, and grew up fiercely independent. As a 10-year-old boy, he made his way to the tough Market Street area and befriended many of the neighborhood characters. When he was 12, his older sister gave him a copy of Ray Charles\u2019 The Genius Sings The Blues, and he became infatuated with the music. Albums from Jimmy Reed, Champion Jack Dupree, Mose Allison, Nina Simone and others soon followed. By the time he was a teenager, Estrin had immersed himself in the urban, African-American culture surrounding him. He got his first harmonica at age 15, and by age 18 was proficient enough to begin sitting in at black clubs around the city. He first jammed with blues master Lowell Fulson and immediately was hired to open five shows for R&B giant Z.Z. Hill. He worked five nights a week for almost a year with guitar legend Travis Phillips in a band fronted by famed pimp/bluesman Fillmore Slim (who was the centerpiece of the acclaimed Hughes Brothers documentary American Pimp). Slim introduced Estrin to singer Rodger Collins, the man who would become Rick\u2019s first real musical mentor. Collins schooled Rick on the finer points of songwriting and show business. At 19, Estrin relocated to Chicago and worked with some of the city\u2019s best bluesmen. He met and jammed with the legendary Muddy Waters, who told Rick, \u201cYou outta sight, boy! You got that sound! You play like a man!\u201d Muddy wanted Estrin to go on the road with him, but Estrin missed Muddy\u2019s phone call and it never happened. Estrin eventually moved back to the Bay Area, met guitarist Charlie Baty and formed Little Charlie & The Nightcats. With Charlie\u2019s retirement from touring in 2008, Rick brought in guitar virtuoso Kid Andersen and formed Rick Estrin & The Nightcats.\n\nEstrin cites Sonny Boy Williamson II, Percy Mayfield and Detroit bluesman Baby Boy Warren as his major songwriting influences. His work on the reeds is deep in the tradition of harmonica masters Sonny Boy Williamson II and Little Walter Jacobs, while at the same time pushing that tradition forward with his innovative songs. And his sly and soulful vocals are the perfect vehicle for driving those songs home.\n\nKid Andersen (guitar)\nChristoffer \u201cKid\u201d Andersen was born in Telemark, Norway. A blues fan since childhood, Andersen fell in love with the music of Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, Junior Watson, and the Kings (B.B., Albert and Freddie). By the time he was 18, he was backing all the American blues stars who came through Norway, including Homesick James, Nappy Brown and Willie \u201cBig Eyes\u201d Smith. He moved to California when he was 21. Once in the U.S.A., Andersen earned a green card as an \u201cAlien of Extraordinary Ability.\u201d Andersen released four solo albums before joining blues harmonica legend Charlie Musselwhite\u2019s band in 2004, a gig that lasted until he joined Rick Estrin & The Nightcats in 2008. In addition to being an expert multi-instrumentalist (guitar, bass, keyboards, percussion), Kid\u2019s talents as engineer and producer keep his now-famous Greaseland Studio fully booked. Winner of the 2017 Keeping The Blues Alive Award, Greaseland has been featured in The San Jose Mercury News as well as on NPR. At Greaseland, Kid has produced, engineered (and many times played on) albums by artists including Tommy Castro, Nick Moss, John Nemeth, Wee Willie Walker and Finis Tasby, as well as all five Rick Estrin & The Nightcats CDs.\n\nLorenzo Farrell (piano, organ)\nLorenzo Farrell was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and grew up in Bloomington, Indiana, where he started playing piano at age five. During his high school years in California, he discovered jazz and made the switch to upright acoustic bass. After high school, Farrell took several years off from his music career to earn a degree in Philosophy from the University of California at Berkeley, and study religion in Delhi, India. Since returning to the San Francisco Bay Area, he has been a highly sought-after multi-instrumentalist, having returned to piano and mastered the organ in recent years. A Nightcat since 2003, Lorenzo has also had the opportunity to perform and/or record with many other artists, including Wee Willie Walker, Elvin Bishop, Finis Tasby, Jackie Payne, Andy Santana, Terry Hanck and Little Charlie Baty\u2019s Organ Grinder Swing.\n\nDerrick \u201cD\u2019Mar\u201d Martin (drums)\nDerrick \u201cD\u2019Mar\u201d Martin is simply a force of nature. D\u2019Mar is a musician, producer, songwriter, singer, educator, entertainer and motivational speaker. He traveled the world for 17 years as the drummer for the legendary Little Richard. D\u2019Mar has also worked with a number of other artists including Dorothy Moore, Bobby Rush, Vasti Jackson, Ali Ollie Woodson (The Temptations), Big Jack Johnson, Carla Thomas, Billy Preston, Roy Gaines, Mitch Woods, Jackie Payne, Syl Johnson, Bob Margolin and Tutu Jones. He shares his passion for music education in his own music lecture series entitled Drums & More. Now, D\u2019Mar brings all of these talents to his new family, The Nightcats.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8656541.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.420776, 37.777043], "Date": "Mon Oct 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-07", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Punk", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Sydney Goldstein Theater"}, {"Address": "17 Broadway Blvd, Fairfax, CA 94930", "Artist": "Derek Smith", "ArtistBio": "Drummer / Producer / Songwriter", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7168664.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.587997, 37.986787], "Date": "Mon Oct 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-07", "Genre": "Genres: Pop, Jazz, Hop-hop, Rock, Electronic, Metal", "OtherInfo": "8pm - Open Mic W/Derek Smith", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "19 Broadway"}, {"Address": "500 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "M.O.M.", "ArtistBio": "Drummer / Producer / Songwriter", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.437364, 37.774222], "Date": "Mon Oct 7 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-07", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "\"M.O.M.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family lineage filled with performers. McGee\u2019s grandparents were part of a traveling gospel quartet, and her father had been a singer in a garage rock band. Her father instilled in McGee a love of classic rock and her passion for music, while her mother gravitated toward classic country. The vivacious entertainer\u2019s own performing career began early, as a karaoke singer at The Red Caboose, a biker bar and grill owned by McGee\u2019s aunt and grandmother. \u201cBefore I could speak in sentences, I was singing in front of people,\u201d McGee recalls. Often, McGee and her sister, along with their parents, would spend weekends helping out at the establishment. \u201cIt made us really well-rounded, because we got to know and observe people from all walks of life. \u201c McGee grew up in a close-knit community, her days a flurry of school, church, family time, and plenty of music. She was enrolled in vocal lessons by age seven, and participated in choirs and singing competitions throughout high school. Her musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and LeAnn Rimes, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. \u201cI was a really big fan of Janis Joplin for a long time,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI loved her uniqueness and how you could feel her emotion when she sang. But the whole rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kind of jagged edge thing wasn\u2019t really me all the way. I always had a sunshiny personality, and I wasn\u2019t as hardened as the rock scene was. Country music always made me happy, and everything always brought me back to that.\u201d \u201cMy goal was always to sing and to sustain myself as a singer,\u201d McGee says. Armed with faith and pluck, McGee placed her bet and traded four years of college for the real-world education of full-time performing. By her late teens, she was performing in several cover bands, in addition to her own live shows. \u201cIf I had taken four years to go to school, I wouldn\u2019t have the experience of playing with a live band, or have had so much time to develop my voice and the direction I wanted to go.\u201d The time spent sharpening her skills paid off when McGee met musician and producer Gary Tackett, a guitarist and tour manager for Billy Currington. Tackett recognized her vocal talent and offered to produce a project. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her upcoming six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. \u201cI was inspired by the concept of returning to a person, even though they are not right for you,\u201d McGee says. \u201cI felt so drawn to that concept that I knocked out this song in about 45 minutes. It just poured out, and is one of my favorites on the project.\u201d McGee laid down tracks in Nashville for the EP at famed studio Ronnie\u2019s Place, alongside musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. Her current single, \"Amen\" has been gaining airplay on Northern California radio stations and has recently climbed to the #5 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which will soon be featuring her music and story. McGee also had her first big act accompanying performance, opening with a 30 minute set for country music superstar, Clay Walker in San Jose. Her self-titled EP will officially be released in April 2015. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone I can get in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me that played in bars and grew up in bars. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d A country singer with some rock hippie flare from Northern California.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9170656.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-121.730065, 37.9020862], "Date": "Tue Oct 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Trilogy at The Vineyards"}, {"Address": "1232 Grant ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "GG Amos", "ArtistBio": "Guitarist / Vocalist GG Amos is an artist in the West Coast Blues tradition.

The founding members were schoolmates David Hinds (the primary songwriter as well as the lead singer and guitarist), Basil Gabbidon (guitar), and Ronnie \"Stepper\" McQueen (bass). All of them came from working class West Indian immigrant families, and none had much musical experience. They took some time to improve their technical proficiency, often on Roots inspired material by the Wailers, Burning Spear and several other prominent Jamaican artists. McQueen suggested the group name, after a racehorse, and they soon fleshed out the lineup with drummer Steve \"Grizzly\" Nisbett, keyboardist/vocalist Selwyn \"Bumbo\" Brown, percussionist/vocalist Alphonso \"Fonso\" Martin, and vocalist Michael Riley.\n\nSteel Pulse initially had difficulty finding live gigs, as club owners were reluctant to give them a platform for their \"subversive\" Rastafarian politics. Luckily, the punk movement was opening up new avenues for music all over Britain, and also finding a spiritual kinship with protest reggae. Thus, the group wound up as an opening act for punk and new wave bands like the Clash, the Stranglers, Generation X, the Police, and XTC, and built a broad-based audience in the process. In keeping with the spirit of the times, Steel Pulse developed a theatrical stage show that leavened their social commentary with satirical humor; many of the members dressed in costumes that mocked traditional British archetypes (Riley was a vicar, McQueen a bowler-wearing aristocrat, Martin a coach footman, etc.). The band issued two singles -- \"Kibudu, Mansetta and Abuku\" and \"Nyah Love\" -- on small independent labels, when they then came to the attention of Island Records after opening for Burning Spear.\n\nSteel Pulse's first single for Island was the classic \"Ku Klux Klan,\" which happened to lend itself well to the band's highly visual, costume-heavy concerts. It appeared on their 1978 debut album, Handsworth Revolution, which was soon hailed as a classic of British reggae by many fans and critics, thanks to songs like the title track, \"Macka Splaff,\" \"Prodigal Son,\" and \"Soldiers.\" Riley departed before the follow-up, 1979's Tribute to the Martyrs, which featured other key early singles in \"Sound System\" and \"Babylon Makes the Rules,\" and solidified the band's reputation for uncompromising political ferocity. That reputation went out the window on 1980's Caught You, a more pop-oriented set devoted to dance tracks and lovers rock. By that point, Steel Pulse was keen on trying to crack the American market, and went on tour over Island's objections. Caught You was issued in the States as Reggae Fever, but failed to break the group, and they soon parted ways with Island.\n\nSteel Pulse moved on to Elektra/Asylum, which released an LP version of their headlining set at the 1981 Reggae Sunsplash Festival. Their studio debut was 1982's True Democracy, a generally acclaimed set that balanced bright, accessible production with a return to social consciousness. It became their first charting LP in America, making both the pop and R&B listings. The slicker follow-up, Earth Crisis, was released in 1984 and featured producer Jimmy \"Senyah\" Haynes subbing on guitar and bass for founding members Gabbidon and McQueen, both of whom left the group by the end of the recording sessions. They were replaced by guitarist Carlton Bryan and bassist Alvin Ewen for 1986's Babylon the Bandit, another Haynes-produced effort that ranked as the group's most polished, synth-centered record to date. It featured the powerful \"Not King James Version\" and won a Grammy for Best Reggae Album.\n\nIn 1988, Steel Pulse released State of Emergency, their most explicitly crossover-oriented album yet. They also contributed the track \"Can't Stand It\" to the soundtrack of Spike Lee's classic Do the Right Thing. In 1991, they released another heavily commercial album, the Grammy-nominated Victims, which featured the single \"Taxi Driver.\" Backing up the song's views, Steel Pulse filed a class-action lawsuit against the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, charging that drivers discriminated against blacks and particularly Rastafarians. Founding member Fonso Martin left that year, reducing Steel Pulse to a core trio of Hinds, Nisbett, and Brown. Their backing band still featured Ewen and was elsewhere anchored by guitarist Clifford \"Moonie\" Pusey, keyboardist Sidney Mills, trumpeter Kevin Batchelor, Saxophonist Jerry Johnson and Trombonist Clark Gayton.\n\nThe 1992 live album Rastafari Centennial marked the beginning of a return to the group's musical roots, and earned another Grammy nomination. The following year, they performed at Bill Clinton's inaugural celebration, the first reggae band to appear at such an event. 1994's studio album Vex completed Steel Pulse's re-embrace of classic roots reggae, though it also nodded to contemporary dancehall with several guest toasters and a digital-flavored production. 1997's Rage and Fury continued in a similar vein, and was nominated for a Grammy. In 1999, the group released another collection of live performances, Living Legacy.\n\nFast forward a long seven years since their previous album, Rage and Fury, Steel Pulse would return yet again, this time with African Holocaust, and yet again have their ranks dwindled. Core members David Hinds (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Selwyn Brown (keyboards, backing vocals) are the only ones to remain from the band's original line-up, but they more than hold their own and they're joined by a deep roster of supporting musicians, a list too long to list. As always, the music is what's most important, and on that count, this Steel Pulse lineup indeed makes the mark. Granted, it did take them seven years to get the album out, but still it won a Grammy Awards Nomination for Best Reggae Album of the year. There's really not too much else to say about African Holocaust. Longtime fans will know what to expect. Newcomers should know a few things: above all, Steel Pulse are known for performing well-written, Afrocentric songs that are rebellious without being negative or inflammatory, and though the band membership has changed over the years, the type of songs hasn't, nor has the steady move away from dancehall that was apparent on the band's previous album. the message and music remain true to the band's principles and vision.\n\nSteel Pulse is one of Britain's greatest reggae bands, in terms of creative and commercial success. Steel Pulse started out playing authentic roots reggae with touches of jazz and Latin music, and earned a substantial audience worldwide. Their 1978 debut, Handsworth Revolution, is still regarded by many critics as a landmark and a high point of British reggae. By the late '80s, Steel Pulse had won a Grammy and were working full-fledged crossover territory. They subsequently returned to a tough-minded, rootsy sound and have added touches of dancehall and hip-hop along the way.", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8653205.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.640098, 38.233411], "Date": "Tue Oct 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-08", "Genre": "Genres: Reggae, Roots, Dub", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Mystic Theatre"}, {"Address": "1511 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117-2912", "Artist": "B3B4", "ArtistBio": "TOM GRIESSER was first exposed to jazz at age five, when he stumbled upon his father's Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington records.

As the brainchild of 9th Wonder's true school resurgence, Rapsody consistently sets the bar high for all emcees, male and female alike. Paying homage to her hip hop godmothers MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, and Lauryn Hill, this Snow Hill, North Carolina native represents much more than just the female side of hip hop culture; she is an emcee who represents hip hop culture beyond the lines of gender, proving that anything the boys can do, she can do, too, and better. Her virtuosity and dexterity behind the microphone highlight her presentation, and her humble demeanor attests to her constant pursuit of improvement with every beat and rhyme. After proving her impeccable craftsmanship with features on 9th Wonder's \"Dream Merchant 2,\" Skyzoo's DJ-Drama hosted \"The Power of Words,\" and numerous Kooley High releases, Rapsody made her solo debut on December 7, 2010 with \"Return of the B-Girl,\" a 20-track project boasting production by 9th Wonder and DJ Premier among others, as well as features from Big Daddy Kane, Mac Miller, Skyzoo, Rah Digga, Phil Ade, and more. A published review praised the record: \"A poet-turned-rapper, Rapdiddy (as she's dubbed herself) has always possessed outstanding wordplay, but B-Girl finds her effortlessly nimble delivery -- capable of both gritty and biting or sassy and sultry -- continuing to improve.\" Rapsody has shared the stage with hip hop legends and rising stars alike, including Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan, Big Daddy Kane, J. Cole, Wale, Colin Munroe, Tanya Morgan, Suede of Camp Lo, Blu and Exile, and The Clipse, but it's her ability to captivate diverse audiences with her explosively dynamic live performance that sets her apart and has earned her much-deserved accolades from major media sources including Vibe, XXL, HipHopDX, and more. She has captivated audiences at sold-out performances at dozens of venues on The Incredibly Dope Tour with Mac Miller and the Mic Fest Tour with 9th Wonder and her Jamla Records label mates. In her sophomore project \"Thank H.E.R. Now,\" she weaves more intimate stories of her personal experiences and shares the studio and soundbooth with heavy hitters Jean Grae, MURS, Raekwon, Estelle, Big K.R.I.T., Marsha Ambrosius, and more. Her style is polished and distinct, and her wordplay and flow are unparalleled in both delivery and execution.

As the brainchild of 9th Wonder's true school resurgence, Rapsody consistently sets the bar high for all emcees, male and female alike. Paying homage to her hip hop godmothers MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, and Lauryn Hill, this Snow Hill, North Carolina native represents much more than just the female side of hip hop culture; she is an emcee who represents hip hop culture beyond the lines of gender, proving that anything the boys can do, she can do, too, and better. Her virtuosity and dexterity behind the microphone highlight her presentation, and her humble demeanor attests to her constant pursuit of improvement with every beat and rhyme. After proving her impeccable craftsmanship with features on 9th Wonder's \"Dream Merchant 2,\" Skyzoo's DJ-Drama hosted \"The Power of Words,\" and numerous Kooley High releases, Rapsody made her solo debut on December 7, 2010 with \"Return of the B-Girl,\" a 20-track project boasting production by 9th Wonder and DJ Premier among others, as well as features from Big Daddy Kane, Mac Miller, Skyzoo, Rah Digga, Phil Ade, and more. A published review praised the record: \"A poet-turned-rapper, Rapdiddy (as she's dubbed herself) has always possessed outstanding wordplay, but B-Girl finds her effortlessly nimble delivery -- capable of both gritty and biting or sassy and sultry -- continuing to improve.\" Rapsody has shared the stage with hip hop legends and rising stars alike, including Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan, Big Daddy Kane, J. Cole, Wale, Colin Munroe, Tanya Morgan, Suede of Camp Lo, Blu and Exile, and The Clipse, but it's her ability to captivate diverse audiences with her explosively dynamic live performance that sets her apart and has earned her much-deserved accolades from major media sources including Vibe, XXL, HipHopDX, and more. She has captivated audiences at sold-out performances at dozens of venues on The Incredibly Dope Tour with Mac Miller and the Mic Fest Tour with 9th Wonder and her Jamla Records label mates. In her sophomore project \"Thank H.E.R. Now,\" she weaves more intimate stories of her personal experiences and shares the studio and soundbooth with heavy hitters Jean Grae, MURS, Raekwon, Estelle, Big K.R.I.T., Marsha Ambrosius, and more. Her style is polished and distinct, and her wordplay and flow are unparalleled in both delivery and execution. As she continues to strive to contend with her hip hop predecessors like Jay-Z and Mos Def, Rapsody is already undeniably one of the strongest and most promising forces in today's hip hop culture.

Drawing from a vast wellspring of American musical traditions, the singer/pianist/composer/bandleader has created a large and accomplished body of work and employed a vast array of stylistic approaches. Throughout this period, Hornsby has maintained the integrity, virtuosity and artistic curiosity that have been hallmarks of his work from the start.\n\nHornsby and his band The Range's first album The Way It Is (1986) was steadily and slowly building in popularity in the U.S. when in August the title track exploded on BBC Radio One in England, then Europe, the rest of the world and finally in the United States. The record went on to sell three million records, the band played Saturday Night Live and opened for Steve Winwood, John Fogerty, Huey Lewis, the Grateful Dead and the Eurythmics before becoming headliners on their own tour supported by Crowded House.\n\nSoon Hornsby was being approached regularly to collaborate with a broad range of musicians and writers, a demand that continues to this day. He has played on records for Bob Dylan, Robbie Robertson, Bonnie Raitt (piano on her iconic \"I Can't Make You Love Me\"), Willie Nelson, Don Henley, Bob Seger, Squeeze, Stevie Nicks, Chaka Khan, Charlie Haden, Jack DeJohnette, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Justin Vernon (of Bon Iver), Leon Russell, Chris Whitley, Warren Zevon, Bernie Taupin, Brandon Flowers (of the Killers), Cowboy Junkies, Shawn Colvin, Bela Fleck, Randy Scruggs, Hillary Scott, the Wild Magnolias, Clint Black, Sara Evans, Clannad and many more. He has worked on his own records with Ornette Coleman, Jerry Garcia, Eric Clapton, Sting, Elton John, Mavis Staples, Phil Collins, Pat Metheny, Branford Marsalis, Wayne Shorter and Justin Vernon, among others. Along with his early collaborator, brother Jonathan Hornsby and latter-day partner Chip deMatteo, Bruce has co-written songs with Robert Hunter (the great Grateful Dead lyricist), Robbie Robertson, Don Henley, Leon Russell, Charlie Haden, Chaka Khan, and Jack DeJohnette. His songs have been recorded by another broad array of artists including Tupac Shakur (his iconic \"Changes\"), Akon, E-40, Chaka Khan, Don Henley, Leon Russell, Willie Nelson, Mase, Randy Scruggs, and Robbie Robertson.\n\nOver the years Hornsby has successfully ventured into bluegrass, jazz, classical, and even electronica, reflected on acclaimed releases like two projects with Ricky Skaggs- Ricky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby (2007) and the live Cluck Ol' Hen (2013), the jazz trio album Camp Meeting (2007) with Jack DeJohnette and Christian McBride, and \"Solo Concerts (2014), a stylistic merging of traditional American roots music and the dissonance and adventure of modern classical music. This latter-day interest has led to an orchestral project spearheaded by Michael Tilson Thomas featuring this new music; the first performance occurred in January 2015 with Tilson Thomas' New World Symphony, and the latest concert with more new material came in February 2017 with the University of Miami graduate orchestra.\n\nHis three Grammy wins (along with his ten Grammy losses!) typify the diversity of his career: Best New Artist (1986) as leader of Bruce Hornsby and the Range, Best Bluegrass Recording (1989) for a version of his old Range hit \"The Valley Road\" that appeared on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's Will The Circle Be Unbroken Volume Two, and a shared award with Branford Marsalis in 1993 for Best Pop Instrumental for \"Barcelona Mona\", a song written and performed for the 1992 Olympic Games.\n\nThe sales stats and breadth of his collaborations (including being sampled many times by rap/hip-hop artists) speak volumes about Hornsby's unique fusion of mainstream appeal and wild musical diversity. His albums have sold over eleven million copies worldwide. Harbor Lights (1993) won the Downbeat Reader's Poll Album of the Year in 1994. Tupac Shakur co-wrote a new song over \"The Way It Is\" music called \"Changes\"; it was a major worldwide hit in 1998, selling 15 million copies. In 2006 his 4 CD set Intersections was selected as one of the best boxed sets of the year by the New York Times. His song \"Levitate\" was selected in 2011 by Sports Illustrated as one of the top 40 sports songs of all time. The most recent record from Bruce and his current band The Noisemakers, which includes Sonny Emory on drums, JV Collier on bass, JT Thomas on keyboards, Ross Holmes on fiddle & mandolin and Gibb Droll on guitar, Rehab Reunion (a collection featuring Bruce on the Appalachian dulcimer) entered the Billboard album chart at 101 upon release in 2016, marking his tenth album appearance on the venerable chart over a thirty-year period. In 2016 the annual Rolling Stone \"Hot List\" selected Bruce as \"Hot Surprise Influence\", citing his influence and inspiration on such modern artists as Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) and Ryan Adams.\n\nThroughout the years Hornsby has participated in several memorable events: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opening concert in September 1995 (with the performance included on the concert album), Farm Aid IV and VI, the Telluride Bluegrass Festival (many times), the Newport Jazz Festival (2007), New Orleans Heritage and Jazz Festival (1997 and 2011), Woodstock II (1994), Woodstock III (1999, with the band's performance included on the concert album), and the Bonnaroo Festival (2011). Hornsby, solo and with Branford Marsalis, has performed the National Anthem for many major events including the NBA All-Star game, four NBA Finals, the 1997 World Series Game 5, the night Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's all-time consecutive game streak, and the soundtrack to \"Baseball: A Film By Ken Burns\". Most recently he was a special guest of Bon Iver for their set at the Coachella festival in April 2017.\n\nBruce's long involvement with the Grateful Dead began when the group asked him to open two shows in Monterey, CA in the spring of 1987. Bruce and the Range continued to open shows for the Dead in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and after the tragic death of Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland the band asked him to play with them. He started winging it with them with no rehearsal for five nights at Madison Square Garden in September 1990,, and played more than 100 shows with them until March 1992. He continued to sit in with the band every year until Jerry Garcia passed away in 1995. He played in the first post-Dead band \"The Other Ones\" in 1998 (the album The Strange Remain chronicles that tour) and 2000. Bruce reunited with the band for the 50th Anniversary Fare Thee Well concerts in June and July 2015 at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, CA) and Soldier Field (Chicago). He appears on seven Grateful Dead records including Infrared Roses and View From The Vault II.\n\nBruce has been part of many tribute records including two Grateful Dead collections, the original Deadicated (1991) and the recent massive compilation curated by the band The National entitled \"Day of the Dead\". He recorded \"Black Muddy River\" with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver and Justin's high school band DeYarmond Edison. Other tribute record appearances include Two Rooms- A Tribute To The Songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin, a Keith Jarrett tribute, a tribute to The Band, a Fats Domino collection, Ricky Skaggs' Big Mon- the music of Bill Monroe, and a Jackson Browne tribute record.\n\nA University of Miami alum, Hornsby has partnered with The Frost School of Music to establish the Creative American Music Program, a curriculum designed to develop the creative skills of talented young artist/songwriters by immersing them in diverse American folk, blues, and gospel traditions that form the foundations of modern American songwriting.\n\nIndeed, Bruce Hornsby's restless musical spirit continues to spontaneously push him forward into exciting new musical pursuits. He's composed and performed for many projects with long-time collaborator, filmmaker Spike Lee including end-title songs for two films, Clockers (1995, with Chaka Khan) and Bamboozled (2001). He contributed music for If God is Willin' And the Creek Don't Rise (2010), Old Boy (2013) and Chiraq (2015), and full film scores for Kobe Doin' Work, Lee's 2009 ESPN Kobe Bryant documentary, 2012's Red Hook Summer, Da Sweet Blood of Jesus (2015), and Lee's film for the NBA2K16 video game (2015). Bruce wrote and performed the end title song \"Set Me In Motion\" for Ron Howard's Backdraft (1991) and a featured song \"Big Stick\" for Ron Shelton's Tin Cup (1996). He's currently working with DeMatteo on a musical entitled SCKBSTD, and contributed music for Disney/Pixar's Planes: Fire And Rescue (2014). Hornsby is also featured onscreen in and contributed music to the Robin Williams/ Bobcat Goldthwaite film World's Greatest Dad (2009), the first (and last!) time he has been asked to \"act\". His latest score, for Spike Lee's Netflix production She's Gotta Have It, was completed Summer 2017.\n\nThree decades after Bruce Hornsby established his global name as the creator of pop hits that defined \"the sound of grace on the radio,\" as a Rolling Stone reviewer once wrote, such projects continue and are consistent with his lifelong pursuit of musical transcendence. \"It's always been about staying inspired, broadening my reach and range of abilities and influences, and exploring new areas\", Hornsby says. \"I'm very fortunate to be able to do that, to be a lifelong student, and to continue to pursue a wide-ranging musical life.\"\n\nDiscography-\nThe Way It Is (1986)\nScenes From The Southside (1988)\nA Night On The Town (1990)\nHarbor Lights (1993)\nHot House (1995)\nSpirit Trail (1998)\nHere Come The Noisemakers (2001)\nBig Swing Face (2002)\nHalcyon Days (2004)\nIntersections (Boxed Set- 2006)\nRicky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby (2007)\nCamp Meeting (2007)\nGreatest Radio Hits (2004)\nLevitate (2009)\nBride of the Noisemakers (2011)\nSoundtrack- Red Hook Summer (2012)\nCluck Ol' Hen- Skaggs-Hornsby Live (2013)\nSolo Concerts(2014)\nThe Essential Bruce Hornsby (Sony Collection- 2015)\nRehab Reunion (2016)", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9020991.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.448345, 37.802902], "Date": "Tue Oct 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-08", "Genre": "Genres: Jam Band Classic Rock, Rock, Jazz, Pop, Bluegrass, you name it", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Palace Of Fine Arts Theatre"}, {"Address": "1601 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115", "Artist": "Drew Southern Band", "ArtistBio": "Bruce Hornsby has built one of the most diverse, collaborative and adventurous careers in contemporary music.

His albums have sold over eleven million copies worldwide. Harbor Lights (1993) won the Downbeat Reader's Poll Album of the Year in 1994. Tupac Shakur co-wrote a new song over \"The Way It Is\" music called \"Changes\"; it was a major worldwide hit in 1998, selling 15 million copies. In 2006 his 4 CD set Intersections was selected as one of the best boxed sets of the year by the New York Times. His song \"Levitate\" was selected in 2011 by Sports Illustrated as one of the top 40 sports songs of all time. The most recent record from Bruce and his current band The Noisemakers, which includes Sonny Emory on drums, JV Collier on bass, JT Thomas on keyboards, Ross Holmes on fiddle & mandolin and Gibb Droll on guitar, Rehab Reunion (a collection featuring Bruce on the Appalachian dulcimer) entered the Billboard album chart at 101 upon release in 2016, marking his tenth album appearance on the venerable chart over a thirty-year period. In 2016 the annual Rolling Stone \"Hot List\" selected Bruce as \"Hot Surprise Influence\", citing his influence and inspiration on such modern artists as Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) and Ryan Adams.\n\nThroughout the years Hornsby has participated in several memorable events: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opening concert in September 1995 (with the performance included on the concert album), Farm Aid IV and VI, the Telluride Bluegrass Festival (many times), the Newport Jazz Festival (2007), New Orleans Heritage and Jazz Festival (1997 and 2011), Woodstock II (1994), Woodstock III (1999, with the band's performance included on the concert album), and the Bonnaroo Festival (2011). Hornsby, solo and with Branford Marsalis, has performed the National Anthem for many major events including the NBA All-Star game, four NBA Finals, the 1997 World Series Game 5, the night Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's all-time consecutive game streak, and the soundtrack to \"Baseball: A Film By Ken Burns\". Most recently he was a special guest of Bon Iver for their set at the Coachella festival in April 2017.\n\nBruce's long involvement with the Grateful Dead began when the group asked him to open two shows in Monterey, CA in the spring of 1987. Bruce and the Range continued to open shows for the Dead in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and after the tragic death of Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland the band asked him to play with them. He started winging it with them with no rehearsal for five nights at Madison Square Garden in September 1990,, and played more than 100 shows with them until March 1992. He continued to sit in with the band every year until Jerry Garcia passed away in 1995. He played in the first post-Dead band \"The Other Ones\" in 1998 (the album The Strange Remain chronicles that tour) and 2000. Bruce reunited with the band for the 50th Anniversary Fare Thee Well concerts in June and July 2015 at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, CA) and Soldier Field (Chicago). He appears on seven Grateful Dead records including Infrared Roses and View From The Vault II.\n\nBruce has been part of many tribute records including two Grateful Dead collections, the original Deadicated (1991) and the recent massive compilation curated by the band The National entitled \"Day of the Dead\". He recorded \"Black Muddy River\" with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver and Justin's high school band DeYarmond Edison. Other tribute record appearances include Two Rooms- A Tribute To The Songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin, a Keith Jarrett tribute, a tribute to The Band, a Fats Domino collection, Ricky Skaggs' Big Mon- the music of Bill Monroe, and a Jackson Browne tribute record.\n\nA University of Miami alum, Hornsby has partnered with The Frost School of Music to establish the Creative American Music Program, a curriculum designed to develop the creative skills of talented young artist/songwriters by immersing them in diverse American folk, blues, and gospel traditions that form the foundations of modern American songwriting.\n\nIndeed, Bruce Hornsby's restless musical spirit continues to spontaneously push him forward into exciting new musical pursuits. He's composed and performed for many projects with long-time collaborator, filmmaker Spike Lee including end-title songs for two films, Clockers (1995, with Chaka Khan) and Bamboozled (2001). He contributed music for If God is Willin' And the Creek Don't Rise (2010), Old Boy (2013) and Chiraq (2015), and full film scores for Kobe Doin' Work, Lee's 2009 ESPN Kobe Bryant documentary, 2012's Red Hook Summer, Da Sweet Blood of Jesus (2015), and Lee's film for the NBA2K16 video game (2015). Bruce wrote and performed the end title song \"Set Me In Motion\" for Ron Howard's Backdraft (1991) and a featured song \"Big Stick\" for Ron Shelton's Tin Cup (1996). He's currently working with DeMatteo on a musical entitled SCKBSTD, and contributed music for Disney/Pixar's Planes: Fire And Rescue (2014). Hornsby is also featured onscreen in and contributed music to the Robin Williams/ Bobcat Goldthwaite film World's Greatest Dad (2009), the first (and last!) time he has been asked to \"act\". His latest score, for Spike Lee's Netflix production She's Gotta Have It, was completed Summer 2017.\n\nThree decades after Bruce Hornsby established his global name as the creator of pop hits that defined \"the sound of grace on the radio,\" as a Rolling Stone reviewer once wrote, such projects continue and are consistent with his lifelong pursuit of musical transcendence. \"It's always been about staying inspired, broadening my reach and range of abilities and influences, and exploring new areas\", Hornsby says. \"I'm very fortunate to be able to do that, to be a lifelong student, and to continue to pursue a wide-ranging musical life.\"\n\nDiscography-\nThe Way It Is (1986)\nScenes From The Southside (1988)\nA Night On The Town (1990)\nHarbor Lights (1993)\nHot House (1995)\nSpirit Trail (1998)\nHere Come The Noisemakers (2001)\nBig Swing Face (2002)\nHalcyon Days (2004)\nIntersections (Boxed Set- 2006)\nRicky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby (2007)\nCamp Meeting (2007)\nGreatest Radio Hits (2004)\nLevitate (2009)\nBride of the Noisemakers (2011)\nSoundtrack- Red Hook Summer (2012)\nCluck Ol' Hen- Skaggs-Hornsby Live (2013)\nSolo Concerts(2014)\nThe Essential Bruce Hornsby (Sony Collection- 2015)\nRehab Reunion (2016)", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [-122.433417, 37.784563], "Date": "Tue Oct 8 2019", "EventDate": "2019-10-08", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "Drew Southern Band at Boom Boom Room: Couches and cocktails complement a blues and funk boogie, which makes shaking it on the checkerboard dance floor an old-fashioned must.

Drawing from a vast wellspring of American musical traditions, the singer/pianist/composer/bandleader has created a large and accomplished body of work and employed a vast array of stylistic approaches. Throughout this period, Hornsby has maintained the integrity, virtuosity and artistic curiosity that have been hallmarks of his work from the start.\n\nHornsby and his band The Range's first album The Way It Is (1986) was steadily and slowly building in popularity in the U.S. when in August the title track exploded on BBC Radio One in England, then Europe, the rest of the world and finally in the United States. The record went on to sell three million records, the band played Saturday Night Live and opened for Steve Winwood, John Fogerty, Huey Lewis, the Grateful Dead and the Eurythmics before becoming headliners on their own tour supported by Crowded House.\n\nSoon Hornsby was being approached regularly to collaborate with a broad range of musicians and writers, a demand that continues to this day. He has played on records for Bob Dylan, Robbie Robertson, Bonnie Raitt (piano on her iconic \"I Can't Make You Love Me\"), Willie Nelson, Don Henley, Bob Seger, Squeeze, Stevie Nicks, Chaka Khan, Charlie Haden, Jack DeJohnette, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Justin Vernon (of Bon Iver), Leon Russell, Chris Whitley, Warren Zevon, Bernie Taupin, Brandon Flowers (of the Killers), Cowboy Junkies, Shawn Colvin, Bela Fleck, Randy Scruggs, Hillary Scott, the Wild Magnolias, Clint Black, Sara Evans, Clannad and many more. He has worked on his own records with Ornette Coleman, Jerry Garcia, Eric Clapton, Sting, Elton John, Mavis Staples, Phil Collins, Pat Metheny, Branford Marsalis, Wayne Shorter and Justin Vernon, among others. Along with his early collaborator, brother Jonathan Hornsby and latter-day partner Chip deMatteo, Bruce has co-written songs with Robert Hunter (the great Grateful Dead lyricist), Robbie Robertson, Don Henley, Leon Russell, Charlie Haden, Chaka Khan, and Jack DeJohnette.
