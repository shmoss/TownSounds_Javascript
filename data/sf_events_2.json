This bred a rabid appreciation for bluegrass and roots music, prompting her to join The Stolen Faces, where she would recreate the vocal abilities of Donna Jean Godchaux in a touring Grateful Dead tribute. From singing with Elizabeth Cooke, Allen Thompson, and Todd Snider, to starting her own band with Bradley Rosen (The Stone Hollers), Elaine has followed her passion of delving into the Americana.

Slim told Steve to \u201clook me up when you come to Chicago.\u201d That is exactly what the young guitarist did, arriving in 1976 and staying until 1994.\nDuring that period Freund played an average of 200 shows per year, with many being two or even three gigs a day. The list of blues masters he has worked with includes Sunnyland Slim, James Cotton, Big Walter Horton, Koko Taylor, Floyd Jones, Luther Allison, and many, many more. He also has appeared on well over fifty recordings, and is an established Delmark recording artist. His latest release is a collaboration with longtime colleagues under the name of Rockwell Avenue Blues Band.\nIn 1994, seeking a change, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he continues to work regularly, with occasional road tours and European shows. His work in the Bay Area includes live shows and recordings with Boz Scaggs and Maria Muldaur.\nDrummer Pete Devine and bassist Joe Kyle are 2/3 of the popular Bay Area roots and blues band HowellDevine, Arhoolie Recording Artists. The combination of these musicians creates a very soulful and powerful trio hearkening back to Chicago in the 1950\u2019s and early 1960\u2019s.\n\"\u2026a commanding, quite soulful vocalist.\" - Lee Hildebrandt, Living Blues Magazine\n\u201cHe is a great guitarist!\u201d - Vintage Guitar Magazine\n\u201cSteve Freund plays with real taste, drive, and creativity.\u201d - Pete Welding, DownBeat\nTickets are $20 general admission; children under 12 are free.

However, it\u2019s worth noting that there are, in fact, a few fucks the guys do give when it comes to their music. Which they have no problem showing.In the studio, Sedz and Fish channel their unabashed, fuck-all attitudes into tracks like their sultry debut single \u201cFace Down\u201d, and the lush vocal cut \u201cEcho\u201d. The guys coin an atmospheric and deep-leaning sound that\u2019s suited to no one particular environment. As Fish tells it, \u201cyou should be able to enjoy it everywhere.\u201d Mates since childhood, Cut Snake grew up on the Gold Coast of Australia; surfing professionally and competing against each other from the time they were 12. In this time, they developed the hilarious banter and incredible dynamic that is still prevalent in interviews and on stage. The guys got into dance music while they were touring the world for surf contests and quickly grew passionate about the underground scenes from each country they visited. With plenty of time waiting for waves, they fine-tuned their production skills from beachfront bungalows, giving their music a fresh feel and their live show a vibe like no other. Outside of their wildly successful surf careers, Sedz channeled his passion and focus for the sport into his music production, and for that he\u2019s known as the \u201cmad scientist\u201d of the duo. Fish is known for his web series, Followthefish.tv. His wild personality and contagious laugh have made him one of the biggest personalities in the surfing industry to date. Now that Cut Snake has relocated stateside and inked a deal with Three Six Zero / Warner Bros. Records, the guys flout the seriousness of the scene in every way possible. Their crazy video antics have amassed a cult following in their home country of Australia and given the guys an edge on US turf. The edge, of course, is in teaching their American audience how to take a break from their day jobs and have a fucking beer...or seven.\nYolanda Be Cool\nIn a world of inflated egos and outrageous demands, Yolanda Be Cool, aka Bondi boys Andy and Matt, have kept their feet on the ground and let their music do the talking.\nThe unavoidable worldwide number one breakthrough track, \"We No Speak Americano\" sold over 5 million copies and amassed over 200 million youtube views. Their critically acclaimed album \"Ladies and Mentalmen\" released on DIM MAK in 2013 featured indigenous Australian icon Gurrumul, house royalty Crystal Waters and Barbara Tucker, soul legend Betty Wright and US up n coming rap star Nola Darling. They even co-own/A&R for the seminal Australian record label Sweat It Out, home to artists such as R\u00dcF\u00dcS, What So Not, Motez and many more.\nsupport by spacely", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Audio Nightclub"}, {"Address": "288 Golf Course Dr W, Rohnert Park, CA 94928", "Artist": "Audio1", "ArtistBio": "AUDIO1 is established DJ and producer from the San Francisco Bay Area.

A mesmeric and transportive collection of songs that firmly establishes him as a preeminent figure in the electronic music world and a rare example of a musician capable of making the transition from club producer to album artist. Featuring collaborations with Lil Silva, Bonobo, and Tracey Thorn (Everything But The Girl), All That Must Be is a richly poignant record that plots a route through the mental and physical landscape of its creator over the course of 18 life-changing months, and in doing so illuminates a more universal set of themes. It documents a time that saw FitzGerald leaving Berlin, his home for the past decade, and returning to London to begin a life with his newly-born daughter. After years as a DJ surrounded by the much-storied hedonism of the German capital, and with few responsibilities other than making his flights each weekend, FitzGerald\u2019s life changed markedly. The result is a record that deals with processes of transition, acceptance and renewal, a backdrop that feels particularly pertinent in a time where young adulthood is elongated ever further and there seem to be fewer reasons to settle down. Arriving back in London, FitzGerald escaped the chaos of his life and began plotting his new record from a small, windowless studio in south Bermondsey. In the mornings he'd walk across Peckham\u2019s Burgess Park and out across the permanent, grubby mayhem of the Old Kent Road to where his studio lay, nestled between industrial units, taxi mechanics and African Pentecostal churches. The energy of this manic yet peculiarly forgotten corner of the city began to infiltrate his thinking and after a while the long days alone in the studio began to bear fruit. Far from a hindrance, being catapulted into an entirely new situation in an unfamiliar part of a city he'd not called home for ten years presented his music with new possibilities. Opening track, \"Two Moons Under\", which begins with the hum of the street outside FitzGerald\u2019s studio, touches on this strange feeling of change and dislocation. \u201cIn many of the songs the vocals are disembodied and processed to the point you can\u2019t make out what they\u2019re saying,\u201d explains FitzGerald. \u201cI wanted that to mirror the uncanniness you feel when a massive event happens in your life. Everything looks and sounds the same but it\u2019s somehow different. Your surroundings are less intelligible.\" FitzGerald also altered his creative process, focusing more heavily on the piano as opposed to the computer and combining the electronic drums of previous album Fading Love with live percussion recorded in the studio. The result is a record with a very human pulse and an emotional maturity only hinted at when FitzGerald had his eyes and ears firmly set on the dancefloor. \"None of the tracks on this record were composed specifically for a club setting\", explains FitzGerald, \"I still wanted to create something fun and enjoyable but, as with the last album, I also wanted to develop a different mood to reflect the changes happening in my life.\" That is not to say that FitzGerald has totally turned his back on the night. There are still plenty of moments of kinetic ecstasy to be found on the album, such as the laser-guided hedonism of \"Burns\" and \"Siren Calls\", it\u2019s just that these are balanced by a more meditative side to FitzGerald's composition in tracks such as \u201cPassing Trains\u201d or Lil Silva-collaboration \u201cRoll Back\u201d. In short, All That Must Be is just as easily experienced on a long drive at night as under the sweaty lights of a club.\n\" target=\"_blank\">/maxresdefault.jpg\" border=0 width=600>\nTickets: After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.
