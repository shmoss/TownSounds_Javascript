Each of your albums has been stronger than your last. You've been brought onstage by Bruce Springsteen, because he wanted to play one of your songs. You've seen high times and low ones, good days and tragic days, but every night you give 100%, and every morning you wake up still swinging.\n\nThis is the short version of the Social Distortion bio \u2014 the long version could be a 10-part mini-series. But over the past 30 years, the punk godfathers in the band have all but trademarked their sound, a brand of hard rockabilly/punk that's cut with the melodic, road-tested lyrics of frontman Mike Ness. Their searing guitars and a locomotive rhythm section sound as alive today as they did in '82, as do Ness' hard-luck tales of love, loss and lessons learned. \"The most common thing I hear is, 'Man, your music got me through some hard times,'\" Ness says. \"And I just say, 'Me too.'\"\n\nHard Times And Nursery Rhymes (produced, for the first time, by Ness himself) is the band's first record since 2004, but the break hasn't changed them much. It maintains Social Distortion's key components \u2014 an all-but-perfected mix of punk, bluesy rock n\u2019 roll and outlaw country \u2014 but it also finds them stretching the boundaries of their signature sound. \"I didn't want any one style of writing,\" Ness says. \"I didn't want it to be all heavy, like \"White Light, White Heat, White Trash.\" I wanted some heavy and some light. I wanted some fiction and some nonfiction. I wanted versatility.\"\n\nThat's evident right away. The record's first vocal track, \"California (Hustle and Flow),\" finds Ness and the band not roaring out of the gate so much as swaggering behind a chunky Stones-style locomotive groove. \"This record has a lot of my influences,\" Ness says, \"But how far you go with those influences is up to you. With this record I wanted to go a little farther. I wanted people to hear that second track and realize, 'Wow, this is not just another Social Distortion record.'\" (For good measure the track has hints of \"Ball and Chain\" and the Stones' \"All Down The Line\" and, for the first time, female backing vocals. \"I've been listening to records for years with (backing vocals), and I was like, \"Hey, why don't I do that?\" Ness laughs.)\n\nNot that the band's punk foundations have eroded; the first single \"Machine Gun Blues,\" a piece of gangland fiction set in 1934, could hail from \"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell.\" But the record is evidence of the band's ability to evolve. \"Bakersfield,\" a setlist staple in recent years, is a waking-on-the-railroad-tracks story of wrecked love, forgiveness and Buck Owens; it closes with a spoken-word verse to make Merle Haggard smile. \"Can't Take It With You\" sports a Jerry Lee-style piano solo that scorches paint. And set closer \"Still Alive\" is a soaring carpe diem with an added emotional weight that can't be described or duplicated.\n\n\"The album is reminiscent to me of \"Somewhere,\" but it also has some of the darkness that \"White Light\" had. It has some of the flavor of \"Mommy's Little Monster,\" Ness said. \"I think it's very signature. We've never been afraid to evolve and show people what we can do.\"\n\n***\n\nNow in their fourth decade, Ness and Social Distortion have officially done one of the most non-punk things possible: They've failed to burn out.\n\nMixing Springsteen\u2019s factory-overalls ethic with Southern California punk energy and black leather, Social Distortion formed with Ness and high school buddy, the late Dennis Danell, in the late 1970s; the group broke in 1983 with the thrashing plate of punk and displeasure \"Mommy's Little Monster.\" Their 1988 follow-up, \"Prison Bound,\" hinted at a sonic change to come, and by the band's self-titled 1990 record and 1992's \"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell,\" their sound had solidified into the instantly recognizable brand of rock n\u2019 roll that's defined them since.\n\nFor Hard Times, Social Distortion consists of Ness and longtime guitarist Jonny Wickersham, along with bassist Brent Harding and drummer David Hidalgo, Jr.\n\nThese days the band is rarely off the road for long, and continues to grip fans who have been around since \"Mommy's Little Monster\" while drawing new ones who discover the band through hand-shot YouTube clips. \"I see people bringing their kids to shows,\" Ness says. \"And I see kids bringing their parents.\"\n\nSocial Distortion is a mix of potent power, appeal across all age brackets and a genuine satisfaction at reaching as many people as they have. \"I write songs for myself, and I hope that other people will like them too,\" Ness says. \"I think every record you make is showing people what you've learned over the past few years. It's showing people, 'This is what I know.' \"", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9092674.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-115.922472, 34.18126], "Date": "Thu Sep 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-26", "Genre": "Genres: Pure Rock N Roll!, Punk", "OtherInfo": "http://bit.ly/2YfvfhG", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Greek Theatre At UC Berkeley"}, {"Address": "34 S B St, San Mateo, CA 94401", "Artist": "Michelle Lambert", "ArtistBio": "\u201cMichelle Lambert is the kind of electric performer whose deep talent reveals itself in sly, knowing bursts.

Literally handed the keys to the historic building for three months, Tomo utilized the 92 year old Roman-revival style hall as his own personal recording studio. Recording alone at odd hours of the night, Tomo used a single microphone plugged directly into his laptop to capture the natural acoustics of the various rooms of Town Hall. Emphasis was placed on first takes and keeping the performances as raw and unedited as possible. In essence and in spirit, Fog On The Lens is a bedroom album created in a cathedral-sized room. To mix the record, Tomo enlisted the help of producer/multi-instrumentalist Yuuki Matthews (of The Shins and Teardrops). Yuuki displayed an immediate and intuitive understanding of Tomo\u2019s vision, mixing onto analog 4-track cassette tape and overdubbing his own wildly imaginative array of analog synthesizers and homemade keyboard sounds which heighten the album\u2019s evocative, dream-like atmosphere. Throughout the album\u2019s 10 songs, Tomo explores the dual dynamics of love and solitude. Textures and moods bend and transform, from the piano driven blast of pop harmonies of \u201cOpen Room\u201d, to the delicate, cascading flurry of fingerpicked guitars of \u201cNightingale\u201d, and the slow, gorgeous melancholy of \u201cMagnolias (for Philip)\u201d, an ode to the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Fog On The Lens finds Tomo pursuing a rawer, more spontaneous and intimate sound than the densely orchestrated sound of Grand Hallway. It combines elements of the acoustic and electronic, analog and digital, lo-fi and hi-fi, the urban and the pastoral. The past and future collide in a colorful, hazy collage. It bears the influence of Tomo\u2019s favorite musicians like Arthur Russell, Bjork, Paul Simon, and The Velvet Underground, yet exists in a world entirely of its own. Fog On The Lens is a quietly confident step forward from a restless soul, unafraid to follow his muse, wherever it leads him. Initially self-released in the fall (Tomo and Yuuki played 14 shows in one day for the record\u2019s release, and the duo toured in Japan on & Records), Fog On The Lens was picked up by Porchlight Records, and it will be re-released on vinyl/CD/digital on March 3, 2015.

All you've got to do is get on it,\" Pete Bernhard says.\n\nThe guitarist/singer and his cohorts in the raw and raucous trio The Devil Makes Three have found their way onto that road numerous times since they first left their picaresque rural hometown of Brattleboro, Vermont. Back then, they had no idea it would lead them to such auspicious destinations as the Newport Folk and Austin City Limits Festivals, Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza, and on tours with Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell and Trampled By Turtles. Along the way, they drew numerous accolades from a growing fan base and press alike.\n\nTDM3's travels and travails serve as inspiration for their fourth album and their New West Records debut, I'm a Stranger Here, produced by Buddy Miller and recorded at Dan Auerbach's (Black Keys) Easy Eye Sound in Nashville.\n\nWith upright bassist Lucia Turino and guitarist Cooper McBean, Bernhard crafted a dozen tunes, part road songs, part heartbreak songs and part barnburners. While most bands are propelled from behind by a drummer, TDM3 builds exuberant rhythms from the inside out, wrapping finger-picked strings and upsurging harmonies around chugging acoustic guitar and bass, plying an ever-growing audience onto its feet to jump, shake and waltz.\n\nTDM3's sound is garage-y ragtime, punkified blues, old n' new timey without settling upon a particular era, inspired as much by mountain music as by Preservation Hall jazz. \"We bend genres pretty hard,\" Bernhard says.\n\nThe combination could only have happened via the circuitous route each of them took to forming the band. As kids in Vermont, \"all raised by sort of hippie parents\" who exposed them to folk, blues and jugbands, Bernhard says, they blazed a path to nearby Boston, Massachusetts in search of punk rock shows. They found venerable venues like The Rat and The Middle East, drawn to east coast bands like the Dropkick Murphys and Aus-Rotten.\n\n\"It would be like 6 bucks for 13 bands, everyone playing for 20 minutes,\" Bernhard says. \"I had so much fun going to shows like that. The energy coming off the stage makes a circle with the crowd and comes back. We were really attracted to that energy.\"\n\nBernhard and McBean, a multi-instrumentalist who plays banjo, musical saw and bass, forged a particular bond. Unlike most of their mutual friends, they both liked to play acoustic music, with McBean showing Bernhard the wonders of Hank Williams and Bob Wills & the Texas Playboys. They kept in touch after high school, when nearly everyone in their clique relocated to the west coast like the characters in Delbert McClinton's song \"Two More Bottles of Wine.\"\n\n\"It was a mass exodus of kids who went out to start bands and be creative, searching for the unknown, dreaming of something different,\" Bernhard says. \"We wanted to get away from where we were from, as many kids do, and California was the farthest we could get.\" Eventually they landed in sunny Santa Cruz, California, where TDM3 took shape in 2001. Their early gigs were house concerts, then small bars, punk shows, bigger rock clubs and theaters and festivals, all the while defying genre and delighting whomever turned up to listen.\n\nTurino learned bass to join the band, but her unremitting sense of rhythm comes naturally from being raised by parents who were dance teachers, and from her own dance background. Attacking the strings of her upright, she understands how to infuse songs with the force it takes to get a crowd moving.\n\nAnd the songs on I'm a Stranger Here tell the rest of the story, with the music often joyously juxtaposed against lyric darkness...the rootless nature of being in a touring band, traveling from town to town with little sense of community, represented by a devil-like character (\"Stranger\")...thorny transitions into adulthood...struggling with relationships (\"Worse or Better\"), watching friends succumb to addiction (\"Mr. Midnight\"), coming to terms with mortality (\"Dead Body Moving\"), nostalgic notions of childhood (\"Spinning Like a Top\"). Bernhard even considers the destruction of changing weather patterns, inspired in part by Hurricane Katrina as well as a flood that wreaked havoc in Brattleboro (\"Forty Days,\" a gospel rave-up recorded with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band).\n\nBernhard wrote more than 20 songs for the album and turned them over to producer Buddy Miller, who gravitated toward the darker material but insured that the recording was lit up by the band's innate ebullience. It was Miller's idea to record at Easy Eye rather than his renowned home studio. \"Easy Eye is like Sun Records,\" Bernhard says. \"There's one live tracking room filled with amazing gear, and that defines the kind of record you're going to make. That was exactly the record we wanted to make, and we knew Buddy was the one who could capture us playing together like we do.\"\n\nFor a band that made its bones with dynamic performances, recording an album is almost like coaxing lightning into a bottle, but Miller and TDM3 succeed on I'm a Stranger Here. Now they're continuing the journey that began when they found their way to the road that led them out of Vermont. \"I can't wait to get onstage, I love it,\" Bernhard says. \"Playing music for a living is a blessing and a curse, but for us there's no other option.\"", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9092554.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.25063, 37.86976], "Date": "Thu Sep 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-26", "Genre": "Genres: Americana", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Hearst Greek Theatre"}, {"Address": "1111 California St, San Francisco, CA 94108", "Artist": "Sabrina Claudio", "ArtistBio": "Singer/Songwriter", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7832285.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.412938, 37.791183], "Date": "Thu Sep 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-26", "Genre": "Genres: alternative r&b, pop, R&B/Soul", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Masonic"}, {"Address": "1807 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94612", "Artist": "Oliver Tree", "ArtistBio": "Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/olivertree Twitter: https://twitter.com/olivertree Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/olivertree", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7999273.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.27017, 37.80785], "Date": "Thu Sep 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-26", "Genre": "No genre available", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Fox Theater"}, {"Address": "155 Fell St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Poldoore", "ArtistBio": "http://poldoore.bandcamp.com\n\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/poldoore\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/poldoore\n\nhttp://www.instagram.com/poldoore\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/poldooremusic", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/5005830.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.42046, 37.775985], "Date": "Thu Sep 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-26", "Genre": "Genres: Beats, Trip Hop, Hip Hop, Instrumental, Jazz, Soul, Reggae, Dub, Funk, Downtempo", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rickshaw Stop"}, {"Address": "420 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "CHERUB", "ArtistBio": "Cherub began in 2010 at Middle Tennessee State University.

Lonely Is a Lifetime reflects a richer confluence of influences, while maintaining their signature soul and spirit and a nod to all that time on the road together. They\u2019ve grown as men and musicians, and they\u2019re ready to claim their spot in the canon of American rock music. Lonely Is A Lifetime featuring Overnight & Into The Sun available now.

His work represents the honest best of what rock & roll can be. It\u2019s passionate, unpretentious, uplifting and true to itself and its audience. Perhaps most of all it is distinctly American, a plainspoken testament to the dignity, hopes and aspirations of ordinary working people. In a time as obsessed with glamour, celebrity, fame and materialism as ours, his songs remain a bracing tonic, an emblem of the belief that everyone\u2019s life is a worthy subject of art. That\u2019s one of the reasons why Seger\u2019s songs have lasted so well and continue to be so well-loved. His Greatest Hits collection has sold more than seven million copies, and albums like Beautiful Loser (1975), Live Bullet (1976), Night Moves (1976), Stranger in Town (1978), Against the Wind (1980) and Nine Tonight (1981) have all enjoyed multiplatinum sales. In March of 2004 Seger was more than deservedly inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Seger\u2019s songs tell stories about characters with whom listeners can readily identify. They are often about people who are trying to find their way through a world that has proven more complex, challenging and perhaps even dangerous than they could have imagined. Innocence drains away, and what\u2019s left is a combination of knowledge, experience and an aching nostalgia for something that has been lost along the way and must be recovered. His characters cross a line, frequently without realizing it, like a car passing over an invisible borderline at night. By the time they figure out that they are no longer in the world they knew, that world is simply a receding image in the rear-view mirror. Getting back to it isn\u2019t always easy. Sometimes it\u2019s not possible. As Thomas Wolfe wrote, \u201cYou can\u2019t go home again.\u201d That road is one that Seger has traveled himself, though he has fortunately always proven able to find his way back home. One of Michigan's finest, he grew up outside the media's spotlight and soaked up the muscular rock & roll and seductive soul sounds for which Detroit remains famous. Drawing on those sources, he defined a musical voice for the American heartland years before John Mellencamp and Bruce Springsteen or any of the other artists who have mined similar territory. But, while rollicking statements of hell-raising intent like \"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\" and \"Heavy Music\" earned him a reputation among hardcore music fans, he struggled for many years to break out of his regional scene. Bad luck and bad timing conspired to keep him a secret from audiences outside Michigan, Florida and a few other hotbeds of support. When people heard and saw Seger, they fell under his spell. It just seemed for a time as if he would have to personally perform in front of every single person he wanted to win over. Finally, he more or less found a way to do that. The album that brought Seger significant national attention was Live Bullet, a double-vinyl-record set that was recorded live in Detroit in 1975 with the Silver Bullet Band, which he had formed the year before. Whatever recognition Seger had garnered to that point was based on two elements: the emotional power of his songs and the intensity of his live shows. Riveting performances of such soon-to-be classics as \u201cBeautiful Loser\u201d and \u201cTurn the Page\u201d combined those two virtues on Live Bullet. The mood was further heightened by the make-or-break ardency that Seger and the band palpably felt. Happily, the album broke and perfectly set the stage for the moment of Seger\u2019s true dramatic rise: Night Moves. That album\u2019s title track, needless to say, ranks with the likes of American Graffiti, the film that inspired it, in its evocative depiction of sexual discovery and the bittersweet passage from adolescence into adulthood. The album\u2019s virtue is that its other songs \u2013 like \u201cMainstreet,\u201d \u201cThe Fire Down Below\u201d and \u201cRock and Roll Never Forgets,\u201d for example \u2013 each isolate an aspect of that journey (lust, yearning, the search for lost youth), which lends it a satisfying sense of unity. It is one of the seminal records of the Seventies, and the ongoing life that \u201cNight Moves\u201d has found on the radio attests to how strongly listeners of all ages have felt their lives represented in it. But Seger was only beginning to find his voice \u2013 or, more accurately, to have his voice heard. He was a superstar now, even if an unusually grounded one, and each of his albums routinely gathered the sort of attention (and often sales) that he had sought so futilely early in his career. The six studio albums he has recorded since that time have generated a catalogue of songs that have entered the pantheon of contemporary popular music: \u201cHollywood Nights,\u201d \u201cStill the Same,\u201d \u201cOld Time Rock and Roll\u201d (which is not a Seger original), \u201cFire Lake,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll Accomp\u2019ny Me,\u201d \u201cAgainst the Wind,\u201d \u201cLike a Rock,\u201d \u201cAmerican Storm,\u201d \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d and \u201cLock and Load,\u201d to compile a list that is by no means complete. Now Seger is back with Face the Promise, an album that extends his legacy into the 21st century. His raw, rough-edged voice still seethes with the conviction that charged it decades ago, but the years have lent him the stature of experience and authority. Not that such authenticity was ever a quality that either Seger or his songs lacked. He has expressed the frustrations, hopes and dreams not simply of people like himself, but that he himself has felt. When he sings, you believe it. The breadth, energy and cinematic beauty of Bob Seger\u2019s music speak eloquently for themselves. His struggle for recognition may have been fought and won long ago, but the battle to convey his vision precisely as he experiences it within himself goes on unabated. Not giving up until he\u2019s satisfied that he\u2019s gotten it right fulfills the promise he has made to his fans and to himself. He faces it every time he steps into the studio, and he delivers on it every time people hear one of his songs and respond, as they so often do, \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what it felt like.\u201d www.bobseger.com", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8713609.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.080678, 37.426767], "Date": "Thu Sep 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-26", "Genre": "Genres: Rock, Classic Rock", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Shoreline Amphitheatre"}, {"Address": "3049 20th Street at Alabama , San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Bluegrass", "ArtistBio": "There is a signature richness and power to the music that Bob Seger has been making for four decades, and as succeeding generations have discovered those qualities, his reputation as an artist and songwriter has only grown.

So here is the preface SWIMM. My dick hasn\u2019t been hard since before N\u00fc metal gave shirtless cock-rock a platform to pirate a once glorified stage of bravado and turn anything with a little meat and potatoes into a creatine shake. My proverbial pendulum hasn\u2019t approached high noon in so long that I\u2019ve considered leaving my job as the lead music journalist at Vegan Sprong. But just as I approached accepting that this industry is as hollowed out as its collective nasal cavity\u2026 I stumbled upon hope in the form of a misspelled oasis in thin font. What I\u2019m getting at is this. Through the twists and turns of objectifying the subjective and hocking my own daily projections onto someone\u2019s precious musing whilst transmogrifying my opinions into printed fact I stumbled upon something that made it matter again. It was SWIMM. And well Hallelujah is right, cause guys\u2026 I think it moved a little.\n\nSWIMM is a band. Though truly it feels as though I\u2019m slighting you to define it so irreverently. Sure\u2026 the semantics. It is a group of guys playing indie music. Genres, directions and influence oh my. The way I see it? You don\u2019t blur genre lines as much as you weave in and around them. Like a dancer trained in the art of the pole, you wrap yourself around every angle of that steel, climbing to exhilarating heights, effortlessly spinning off in exciting directions but still poised and comfortable in the intimacy of an eye-locking ass-clap. Again\u2026 even thinking about it\u2026 It moved a little. The ambition to strive for a singular voice and sincerity in music is often the \u2018unapproachable model sitting alone smoking a menthol at the bar blankly staring above her glass of sherry\u2019. So the mirabilia in you finding that is not lost on me. But to this there is that and to that there is this! An innate humor that often detracts the listener from ever taking you too seriously. Well let\u2019s say more seriously than you would ever want. And in that my SWIMM friends the truth you are tapping into does not beg for recognition nor does it parry those listeners with phlegmatic constitution. Cause let\u2019s face it, apathy has near and far replaced \u2018easy listening\u2019.\n\nIn your new single \u201cMan\u2019s Man\u201d you relay the hilarity of a cliche Los Angeles artist type molding sincerity in heartbreak through conjured New Age justifications. You sing \u201choroscopes for answers please, a whore before but now I see my actions don\u2019t define me. // I\u2019m existential ego free, waiting for the feels to leave// still I\u2019d rather hear you cry and than to hear you say you love me.\u201d\n\nYour writing process. Well I find it reflects the corybantic nature of our fast food society and well\u2026 how else could we all relate? In one moment a plea with reality and a bargain with aspirations and in another the possibility that all the secrets of the universe are tied up in the banal observations we may be too preoccupied to ruminate upon.\n\nTake \u201cBeverly Hells\u201d, the title track of your last EP and the first sign that you were willing to go a little deeper. In one sense a satirical rant on the absurdity of Hollywood. In another sense, a love song simply pining for the genuine to reveal itself.\n\nBut what would these words be than just someone\u2019s drunk uncle slurring his ethos in late night text messages without a marriage of palpable sonic elements. Palpable in the way your brain gets chills and softly vibrates much like an underwater eel garden when clean MDMA introduces itself to your senses. (Or so I\u2019ve heard) Or the way your whole body feels a chord when just the right amount of psilocybin is ingested. (Also, i\u2019ve heard) Perhaps SWIMM, you knew you must create the world in which these lyrics live, in just the right way to express the sentiments they speak to your easily detracted, Ritalin generation.\n\nBut here is the clincher for me. Let\u2019s see. How can I explain this. Ok, every once in a while I want to forget our technological advances and the jejune twinkling of Apple laptop music and swing my cock (again, proverbial) around like a freshman named Max or Cooper, who wears tie-dye with unapologetic naivet\u00e9 and doesn\u2019t fear the capricious pathways of the subconscious that can be opened by LSD. Pardon but can someone just fuck me up a little? Well SWIMM you do that for me too. Cause boys, even though you will only grow softer in your quarter life crisis\u2026 much like my metaphorical member, I can tell it is within you to need that same release. And sooner or later, after Cookie gets his fill of slowly dry humping the audience\u2019s ears via his crush velvet whispers he too will reach for his balls (must I reiterate at this point?). He will kick a pedal and lose his shit and we will all get the kick in the dick we\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong but the sound of distorted guitars and live drums is still a thing right? In some remote corner of the music world? Well when I walked into their warehouse in downtown LA, aptly named The Cube, and the entire place was transformed into a sexedelic space hub of wild abandonment, I started to believe again. Adam whipped his curly locks to and fro whilst pounding those drums and well you could color me convinced. Forgive me now if my musical latissimus dorsi are bulging like Henry Rollins without his shirt on but why does testosterone in music have to feel so barbaric? And to that, why does the term singer/songwriter make me want to barf sparkles and kleenex drenched in unrequited tears. Oh Ritalin Generation!!! I ask you! Must we choose? Must we either gaze or rock? Must we either sway or shimmy? Must we either make love or fuck? Must we choose? SWIMM I feel I don\u2019t need to choose with you. And for that, from the bottom of my \u201cnot flaccid, not yet a hard cock\u201d I thank you.\n\n-Donni Leiberman,\nVegan Sprong", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9236343.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.43751, 37.775533], "Date": "Thu Sep 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-26", "Genre": "Genres: Alternative, Indie", "OtherInfo": "Crooked Colours", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Independent"}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Crooked Colours", "ArtistBio": "Crooked Colours burst onto the scene in 2014 when they were handpicked by triple j Unearthed to perform at St. Jerome\u2019s Laneway Festival after the breakout success of hit single \u2018Come Down\u2019.

Most were meditations on his now thirteen-year-old daughter, Marie-Claire, and the life-threatening tumor that has afflicted her left-eye. The recording was done live without overdubs on Adrien\u2019s farm and was imbued with the passing of producer Ian Brennan\u2019s mother during the days that they were there together as well as a former founding band member recently having succumbed to his own demons.\n\nThe Good Ones renown is evidenced by the stellar musicians who collaborated with them on the new album: Wilco\u2019s Nels Cline, TV on the Radio\u2019s Tunde Adebimpe, Sleater-Kinney\u2019s Corin Tucker, My Bloody Valentine\u2019s Kevin Shields, and Fugazi\u2019s Joe Lally. In 2009, Grammy-winner Brennan (Tinariwen, Ramblin\u2019 Jack Elliott, Zomba Prison Project) traveled to Rwanda in search of local music with his Italian-Rwandan wife, filmmaker and photographer, Marilena Delli. After two weeks of crisscrossing the country and listening to countless artists, they met The Good Ones.\n\nFrom the moment he laid eyes on them, Brennan said he knew, \u201cWhat these guys do is precious and rare. Don't fuck it up!\u201d\n\nBeginning in 1978 when they were still children, the group\u2019s core members were taught music by Janvier\u2019s older brother who was blind and later perished in the 1994 genocide. They formed the band as a healing process after the genocide and the original trio\u2019s membership reunited Rwanda\u2019s three tribes (with one member each from the Tutsi, Hutu, and Abatwa tribes). It was an active attempt to seek out \u201cthe good ones,\u201d after having endured and witnessed unthinkable horrors.\n\nSince they live without electricity and have had little access to devices to reproduce musical recordings, The Good Ones\u2019 vocalizations are based on the singing traditions and dialect of their local immediate, agricultural district more than by outside and Western influences. Primary songwriter Adrien Kazigira interweaves intricate harmonies with co-singer, Janvier Havugimana, in a style frequently referred to as \u201cworker songs from the streets.\u201d With the musicians rural and remote hilltop origins, the harmonic similarities to American Bluegrass vocals is often eerie. Third member, Javan Mahoro, lends additional background vocals and percussion on select songs.\n\nThey utilize one-of-a-kind instruments in their music, often incorporating their own farming tools as percussion. Adrien continues to subsist as a farmer on the land that he and his children were born on, where he hid for months and survived the genocide, and the place where his wife died.\n\nTheir music and original songs have received great acclaim globally and the group has appeared on various BBC-radio programs, as well as on The Netherlands VPRO national-television breakfast show. In fact, they also have been publicly praised by the likes of legendary Led Zeppelin lead-singer, Robert Plant, and Grammy-winning, platinum-selling group, Mumford & Sons.\n\nIn 2010, The Good Ones released their debut album, Kigali Y Izahabu (\u201cKigali of Gold\u201d), making them the first Rwandan artists to distribute internationally songs in the language of Kinyarwanda.

Scott Gates, a native to the Southern California bluegrass scene, plays the mandolin with a healthy mix of finesse and mayhem. His ear-bending tones can go from sounding like classical mandolin to electric guitar and everything in between. And to add insult to injury Scott is also an exceptional singer and songwriter. Chuck Hailes, who started out playing jazz and classical bass, has evolved into quite the musical mischief-maker. His playing style ranges from dulcet bowing tones to off-kilter funky grooves, and he might just break your heart with his beautifully poignant original songs. Singer Chelsea Williams has a voice that is one part honey and two parts whiskey. Her sweet sound can turn to gravel in an instant and her bittersweet songs tempt you into believing that you might actually enjoy a little bit of heartache.\nTickets are $15 in advance and $18 at the door, general admission; $10 advance, $13 at the door for students with ID.

In a career that spans almost four decades, he's gone from drumming for blues icon Albert Collins to holding the lead guitar spot in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers to leading his own band and touring worldwide. Montoya is revered for his ability to move from subtly melodic guitar playing to slash-and-burn pyrotechnics. Equally forceful are his deep, soul-baring vocals. Years of constant touring, playing unforgettable shows at clubs, concert halls and festivals, have earned him his position at the top of the contemporary blues world. And it all started with a chance meeting in the mid-1970s with legendary bluesman Albert Collins, who offered Montoya a spot in his band, where he stayed for the next five years. Coco was initially hired as Collins' drummer and later\u2014with Albert mentoring him on the guitar\u2014became the band's rhythm guitarist. A few years after leaving Collins' band, British blues star John Mayall heard Coco jamming onstage and was so impressed that he hired him for the newly reformed Bluesbreakers.\n\nWhen Montoya launched his solo career in 1993, he already had an instantly recognizable burning-hot sound and style all his own. His debut album solidified his stature as the blues' newest rising star. Over the course of his nine previous solo albums, Montoya has consistently delivered piping hot blues, rock and soul. His new album (his fifth for Alligator), Coming In Hot, is another instant classic. Montoya's fiery, melodic guitar playing and passionate vocals fuel one memorable song after another. Guitar Player says Montoya plays \"stunning, powerhouse blues with a searing tone, emotional soloing, and energetic, unforced vocals.\"\n\nComing In Hot, produced by Tony Braunagel (Eric Burdon, Curtis Salgado, Taj Mahal, Bonnie Raitt), features 11 songs, ranging from the blistering, hard-rocking title track to the gritty and potent blues shuffle Water To Wine to the emotional ballad What Am I?. He delivers Albert Collins' Lights Are On But Nobody's Home with uncompromising, dynamic energy. Montoya's unpredictable guitar playing and smoking, soulful vocals are inspired by a backing band featuring renowned musicians including bassists Bob Glaub (Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Jerry Lee Lewis) and Mike Mennell (Jimmy Buffett, John Fogerty), keyboardist Mike Finnigan (Jimi Hendrix, Etta James, Taj Mahal), rhythm guitarists Billy Watts (Eric Burdon) and Johnny Lee Schell (Bonnie Raitt), and Braunagel on drums.\n\nHenry \"Coco\" Montoya was born in Santa Monica, California, on October 2, 1951, and raised in a working class family. Growing up, Coco immersed himself in his parents' record collection. He listened to big band jazz, salsa, doo-wop and rock 'n' roll. His first love was drums; he acquired a kit at age 11. He got a guitar two years later. \"I'm sure the Beatles had something to do with this,\" Montoya recalls. \"I wanted to make notes as well as beats.\" But guitar was his secondary instrument. Montoya turned his love of drumming into his profession, playing in a number of area rock bands while still in his teens and eventually becoming an in-demand drummer.\n\nIn 1969, Montoya saw Albert King opening up a Creedence Clearwater Revival/Iron Butterfly concert at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. He was transformed. \"After Albert got done playing,\" says Montoya, \"my life was changed. When he played, the music went right into my soul. It grabbed me so emotionally that I had tears welling up in my eyes. Nothing had ever affected me to this level. He showed me what music and playing the blues were all about. I knew that was what I wanted to do.\"\n\nThen fate took over. In the early 1970s, Albert Collins was booked to play a matinee at the same small club in Culver City, California, where Montoya had played the night before. The club owner gave Collins permission to use Montoya's drums. Montoya continues the story: \"I show up to pick up my equipment and I see that someone had been playing my drums and I got a little angry with the club owner. So Albert called me up at the club and was real nice and apologetic. I went down to see his show and it just tore my head off. The thing that I had seen and felt with Albert King came pouring back on me when I saw Albert Collins.\"\n\nA few months later, Collins desperately needed a drummer for a tour of the Northwest and he called Coco. During the tour, Albert took Montoya under his wing, teaching him about blues music and life on the road. After the tour ended, Montoya remained in the band for five more years. It was during this time that Coco began doubling on guitar. And Albert went out of his way to teach him. \"We'd sit in hotel rooms for hours and play guitar,\" remembers Montoya. \"He'd play that beautiful rhythm of his and just have me play along. He was always saying, 'Don't think about it, just feel it.' He was like a father to me,\" says Coco, who often crashed at Collins' home. When he declared Montoya his \"son,\" it was the highest praise and affection he could offer. In return, Montoya learned everything he could from the legendary Master of the Telecaster.\n\nIn 1984, John Mayall needed a guitarist for the newly reformed Bluesbreakers. Hearing Coco at a jam session, he was blown away, and offered Coco this prestigious spot in his legendary band. Filling the shoes of previous Bluesbreaker guitarists Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Mick Taylor would not be easy, but Montoya knew he could not pass up the opportunity to play with another blues legend. For the next ten years he toured the world and recorded with Mayall, soaking up the experience of life on the road and in the recording studio. Along with fellow Bluesbreaker guitarist Walter Trout, Montoya was a featured member of the band, and often opened shows with his own blistering blues.\n\nBy the early 1990s, Montoya struck out on his own. His debut as a leader, 1995's Gotta Mind To Travel (originally on Silvertone Records in England and later issued in the USA on Blind Pig Records), became an instant fan favorite. Blues fans, radio programmers and critics sent praise from all corners. The album immediately made it clear that Montoya was a guitarist and vocalist who ranked among the best players on the contemporary blues scene. In 1996, he won the Blues Music Award for Best New Blues Artist. Two more Blind Pig albums followed, and Coco was well on his way to the top of the blues-rock world.\n\nIn 2000, Coco's Alligator debut, Suspicion, quickly became the best-selling album of his career, earning regular radio airplay on over 120 stations nationwide. Montoya's fan base exploded. After two more highly successful and massively popular Alligator releases\u20142002's Can't Look Back and 2007's Dirty Deal\u2014Montoya signed with Ruf Records, cutting both a live and a studio album. Returning to Alligator with 2017's Hard Truth, Montoya delivered another fan and critical favorite. \"Montoya unleashes one career-topping performance after another.\" declared Blues Matters, \"the music immediately ranking among the best he's ever recorded.\"\n\nNow, with Coming In Hot, Coco Montoya again turns the burners to high and cooks from start to finish. Still an indefatigable road warrior, Montoya continues to tour virtually nonstop, bringing audiences to their feet from New York to New Orleans to Chicago to San Francisco. Across the globe, he's performed in countries including Australia, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, England, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Ecuador, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Czech Republic and Canada. According to Living Blues, \"Montoya is a show-stopper...heartfelt singing and merciless guitar with a wicked icy burn...he swings like a jazz man and stings like the Iceman, Albert Collins. He is one of the truly gifted blues artists of his generation.\"", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8970356.jpeg", "Coordinates": [-122.26958, 37.870738], "Date": "Thu Sep 26 2019", "EventDate": "2019-09-26", "Genre": "Genres: Blues, Rock, Rhythm", "OtherInfo": "No other event info available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse"}, {"Address": "628 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117", "Artist": "Nyxen", "ArtistBio": "Crafting a relationship between a passion and a love for music, births the rise of a humble-grounded Sydney-sider who has made strong waves from the beginning of her music career in 2015 with her adoption to the Unknown Records family.

Bishop wrote or co-wrote five songs (including two by the entire trio).

Willy Jordan sings lead on four songs, including blistering reinventions of Jackie Wilson\u2019s Higher And Higher and Ann Peebles\u2019 I Can\u2019t Stand The Rain. Bob Welsh, whose guitar or piano playing highlight every song, pounds the ivories on his own Bob\u2019s Boogie. \u201cThis album fell together easily,\u201d says Bishop. \u201cEverything I visualized about the songs\u2014from Bob\u2019s playing to Willy\u2019s singing, came true.

It\u2019s rootsy but also new. We all stayed simple to stay strong.\u201d Welsh, originally from Covington, Louisiana, has performed and toured with Bishop, Rusty Zinn, Charlie Musselwhite, Billy Boy Arnold, James Cotton and others. Welsh says he too loves playing in the Trio. \u201cPlaying this music is fun and fresh and new to us. It keeps us on our toes. We\u2019re always surprising each other. We have to be fearless.\u201d\n\nBorn in Glendale, CA on October 21, 1942, Bishop grew up on a farm in Iowa before relocating to Oklahoma when he was ten. He first got hooked on the blues listening to late night R&B radio as a teenager, and began collecting, listening to and absorbing blues music. Once Bishop realized that many of his favorite records were recorded in Chicago, he used his 1959 National Merit Scholarship as a way to get closer to his blues heroes by enrolling in the University of Chicago, whose campus was located near dozens of the South Side clubs.\n\nAfter Elvin crossed paths with harmonica player and fellow University of Chicago student Paul Butterfield, the two began sitting in together at South Side clubs, often jamming with Buddy Guy and Otis Rush. They first formed The Paul Butterfield Blues Band in 1963, adding Jerome Arnold on bass, Sam Lay on drums and later Mark Naftalin on keyboards. Prior to cutting their debut LP in 1965, Michael Bloomfield joined the group as second lead guitarist, creating a groundbreaking, all-star band. The self-titled The Paul Butterfield Blues Band introduced electric Chicago blues to the rock audience for the first time. With the release of East/West in 1966, the band\u2019s popularity hit an all-time high. Their straight Chicago blues sounds drifted further into progressive and experimental rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and\u2014with two world-class lead guitarists on board\u2014the band helped pave the way for groups featuring multiple virtuoso guitarists, like The Allman Brothers Band and Derek and the Dominos. The band, including Bishop, was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 2015.\n\nTowards the end of the 1960s, after recording three albums with The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin decided to move on, heading for the San Francisco area. He became a regular at the famed Fillmore Auditorium jam sessions, playing alongside Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, B.B. King and many others before embarking on a solo career. He recorded first for Fillmore Records, then Epic and then for Capricorn, where his career took off. He charted with Travelin\u2019 Shoes before scoring big in 1975 with Fooled Around And Fell In Love (the song reached number three on the pop charts and was prominently featured in the blockbuster film, Guardians Of The Galaxy).\n\nAfter a seven-year recording hiatus, Elvin returned to his blues roots in 1988, signing with Alligator and releasing five albums between 1988 and 2000. After a few releases on other labels, Bishop returned to Alligator with 2014\u2019s Can\u2019t Even Do Wrong Right, and once again turned the music-loving world on its head. Reviews poured in from NPR\u2019s Fresh Air, Rolling Stone, Living Blues, No Depression and many others. He appeared on TBS-Television\u2019s CONAN and performed numerous times on A Prairie Home Companion, most recently with The Big Fun Trio.\n\nWith Something Smells Funky \u2018Round Here, Elvin Bishop\u2019s Big Fun Trio are clearly having a very good time. Having spent almost three years performing, these three tremendously talented musicians continue to inspire each other to new heights. As Elvin Bishop\u2019s Big Fun Trio take their music back on the road, fans will once again have a chance to experience the big fun first hand.

We have to be fearless.\u201d\n\nBorn in Glendale, CA on October 21, 1942, Bishop grew up on a farm in Iowa before relocating to Oklahoma when he was ten. He first got hooked on the blues listening to late night R&B radio as a teenager, and began collecting, listening to and absorbing blues music. Once Bishop realized that many of his favorite records were recorded in Chicago, he used his 1959 National Merit Scholarship as a way to get closer to his blues heroes by enrolling in the University of Chicago, whose campus was located near dozens of the South Side clubs.\n\nAfter Elvin crossed paths with harmonica player and fellow University of Chicago student Paul Butterfield, the two began sitting in together at South Side clubs, often jamming with Buddy Guy and Otis Rush. They first formed The Paul Butterfield Blues Band in 1963, adding Jerome Arnold on bass, Sam Lay on drums and later Mark Naftalin on keyboards. Prior to cutting their debut LP in 1965, Michael Bloomfield joined the group as second lead guitarist, creating a groundbreaking, all-star band. The self-titled The Paul Butterfield Blues Band introduced electric Chicago blues to the rock audience for the first time. With the release of East/West in 1966, the band\u2019s popularity hit an all-time high. Their straight Chicago blues sounds drifted further into progressive and experimental rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and\u2014with two world-class lead guitarists on board\u2014the band helped pave the way for groups featuring multiple virtuoso guitarists, like The Allman Brothers Band and Derek and the Dominos. The band, including Bishop, was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 2015.\n\nTowards the end of the 1960s, after recording three albums with The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin decided to move on, heading for the San Francisco area. He became a regular at the famed Fillmore Auditorium jam sessions, playing alongside Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, B.B. King and many others before embarking on a solo career. He recorded first for Fillmore Records, then Epic and then for Capricorn, where his career took off. He charted with Travelin\u2019 Shoes before scoring big in 1975 with Fooled Around And Fell In Love (the song reached number three on the pop charts and was prominently featured in the blockbuster film, Guardians Of The Galaxy).\n\nAfter a seven-year recording hiatus, Elvin returned to his blues roots in 1988, signing with Alligator and releasing five albums between 1988 and 2000. After a few releases on other labels, Bishop returned to Alligator with 2014\u2019s Can\u2019t Even Do Wrong Right, and once again turned the music-loving world on its head. Reviews poured in from NPR\u2019s Fresh Air, Rolling Stone, Living Blues, No Depression and many others. He appeared on TBS-Television\u2019s CONAN and performed numerous times on A Prairie Home Companion, most recently with The Big Fun Trio.\n\nWith Something Smells Funky \u2018Round Here, Elvin Bishop\u2019s Big Fun Trio are clearly having a very good time.

Whether he was playing raw, eye-popping blues, or penning the evergreen radio hit Fooled Around And Fell In Love, or touring the world for decades delivering his original, good-time countrified blues, Bishop has always inspired his fans with his rowdy guitar playing and witty, slice-of-life songs. Rolling Stone calls Bishop \u201ca legendary guitarist\u201d whose playing is \u201cimpeccable and spirited...a distinguished American player.\u201d\n\nLate in 2015, Elvin Bishop formed The Big Fun Trio, with Bishop on guitar and vocals, and his friends Bob Welsh on piano and guitar and Willy Jordan on caj\u00f3n (a hand-played Peruvian drumbox) and vocals. After playing just a handful of live dates, the group\u2019s instantly crowd-pleasing music and undeniable chemistry took the blues world by storm. With the release of their self-titled CD in 2017, media and fan response was immediate and overwhelming. DownBeat celebrated Bishop\u2019s \u201cverbal hijinks, outstanding guitar work and country boy friendliness.\u201d OffBeat said The Big Fun Trio was \u201cintricate, funky and uplifting,\u201d declaring them, \u201cconsistently great.\u201d With its top-shelf musicianship and front-porch vibe, the album earned a Grammy Award nomination, and won Blues Music Awards for Album Of The Year and Song Of The Year (for the title track) from The Blues Foundation.\n\nThe Big Fun Trio quickly discovered the more they played live, the more fun they had making music together. So a follow-up recording was an easy decision. The new album, Something Smells Funky \u2018Round Here, finds the group fearlessly laying it all on the line. According to Elvin, \u201cWith a trio there\u2019s no place to hide\u00ad\u2014you\u2019ve got to be pourin\u2019 everything you got right out front. You need to be totally into it all the time. It\u2019s really cool to see how people react to the goin\u2019-for-it feel of the music.\u201d\n\nThe album mixes rousing, new originals, reinventions of three Bishop classics and some unexpected, soul-shaking covers. Something Smells Funky \u2018Round Here was produced by Bishop and Steve Savage and recorded at Bishop\u2019s Hog Heaven Studio in Lagunitas, California. Bishop wrote or co-wrote five songs (including two by the entire trio). The potent title track\u2014a tongue-in-cheek State Of The Union address as only Elvin can deliver\u2014 kicks the album off with Bishop aiming his lyrical truths at those in power. The humorous but piercingly direct lyrics take aim at the current political scene while Bishop\u2019s deep blues guitar playing drives the point home.\n\nLookin\u2019 Good finds Bishop autobiographically gazing in the rearview mirror with sharp, wry lyrics accompanied by Welsh\u2019s perfect blues piano. Willy Jordan sings lead on four songs, including blistering reinventions of Jackie Wilson\u2019s Higher And Higher and Ann Peebles\u2019 I Can\u2019t Stand The Rain. Bob Welsh, whose guitar or piano playing highlight every song, pounds the ivories on his own Bob\u2019s Boogie. \u201cThis album fell together easily,\u201d says Bishop. \u201cEverything I visualized about the songs\u2014from Bob\u2019s playing to Willy\u2019s singing, came true. Bob and Willy are great musicians.\u201d\n\nAccording to San Francisco Bay native Jordan, who has decades of experience playing drums with artists including John Lee Hooker, Joe Louis Walker and Angela Strehli, playing in the Big Fun Trio is \u201ccrazy different.
